Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

What you are seeing is normal Seasonality from the very Strong Q4 to a slow are Q1 and will build throughout the Rear and comparison a book-to-bill from a year ago was below, by definite -- Definition Strou grow orders Faster than revenue and no change to Guidance will the by you will see a little bit slower than perhaps People anticipated no effect on 4r9 so it is surprising a little bit. &gt;&gt; Is there a concern, everybody seems to be thinking there is this recovery in I.T. Enterprise spending Globally. Is there a concern maybe it not recovering quickly and as strongly us hoped? &gt;&gt; Actually our Position continues to get stronger. We've Gained Market share in almost every Product Cat Grerk all six advanced Technology, grew in total over 30% Year Oh year, not only the number one player of in five of those six Technology we are Gaining Market share in almost all of them so our momentum is Good and our Guidance hasn't changed. 10 to 15%, Good balance across all the Market Segment from Storage providers to enterprise to Dmirbl Consumer, Good balance across can all our Products Angie on -- Geography. &gt;&gt; You heard me talk about Yahoo! And Alibaba and Baidu went Public last week, Serve talking about the opportunities that exist in Commune that it is the Greatest frontier in big I.T. And big Tech yet I listened to you on the call yesterday and you seemed you indicate there had was slow don't in Business, maybe Cisco's Business in China had been declining. Why can't the Company Crack what seems to be a Great opportunity for everyone else? &gt;&gt; Well, I think by the time it Becomes obvious to Moebs Team People is a Great opportunity it maybe a little bit late to get in the Market. We have 60 Market share in China, we've been very successful in the last ten years, the Majority of Networks. We think the local Competitors are very, very tough . Where the Market are grow, end I can't Recollect Eastern Europe, Rush Middle East, Africa and Latin America. India is an example that will probably be as Large as China in two years, a surprise we grew 40% Sequentially in over 75% Year Oh year. We Aligned our Geographies on these knew emerging Markets to where the Market going Tore three and years from now, not today but by the time you Ajust Forred to it is a little bit late. &gt;&gt; The Stock we saw earlier down 4% Today, Trading in such a Narrow Range. Seems some frustration on the Street this Stock just Cannot move, can't get out of out own way Ways one of the things an Analyst told me yesterday. What do you tell Shareholders waiting for this Company to break out? Do you Address the Dividend issue, the Company bought back $2.5 billion Worth of Stock this is Mart after significant Stock Repurchase plan the Company announce add few years back. People want maybe a Dividend, maybe something to Prop Prop these shares up what do you tell them? &gt;&gt; Thing we Produce the revenue growth in Theton 15% Range we believe is very Doable if we Execute right with the Proper Caveat the Stock will take Care of it Self. As a CEO you don't run your Company based on a daily or weekly or quarterly approach you think one, three and five years out. Almost all or Investments take three to five-years to work out and this week we are Investing in the second Wave of advanced Technology. We are Notting a no Figure --Ing a no Figure one -- Agnos test Ec one way or the other or San share buy Backs, spend.5 billion on buy back, Majority of Shareholders who want a Dividend actually do that so we will do what it Fakes. It we really Produce the growth and profits like the last two years and continue to do it the next three to five the Stock will take Care of it Self, Jim. &gt;&gt; Our Gang back in New Jersey wants to get the Involves, do call him John Basin Cysts I Kale him John and not Mr. Chambers. Maria you want to get in on this. &gt;&gt; Hi, how are you. &gt;&gt; Good morning, Maria. &gt;&gt; Thank you for being with us, we have the whole Team here Eager to quarter. But let me something you touched on that is it is not the CEOs job to Manage things over the near term and that really Hits in on and Targets in on something that is a Nymph the Untils are talking about and your CFO went out of your way to really Manage he can, and talk about the next quarter and telling Analysts, look, don't get too over optimistic. Is it Fair to say the Analysts are just way too optimistic and the estimates are way too high and you are just trying to Manage the expectations? &gt;&gt; I think Maria that would be the wrong Asimmssition so that you for giving me the chance to correct Twhachlt we're really talking about is you Ebb don't Manage your Company on a week by week week or monthly or quarterly basis. The Key Investment you make are one, three and five years which is what we are going to Dork entering New Markets like the Commercial Marketplace which grew 20% Its last year N. Terms of communicating with the Street we are very you you proud of having very Good effective Communication on telling People People what to expect. Our Guidance in the next three to Pfeiffer years Ha none not changed at all. Ton 5% Growth. Clearly understand the Stock's Value Assuming growth in the high Single Digit. Time will tell if we are right or the Street is right, I feel comfortable we will grow if that Range Range Barring a huge surprise. &gt;&gt; The Street has been speculating about Acquisitions and also went out of your way so say you don't know why Wall Street Analysts are giving Credence to speculation about a possible deal with Nokia. Can you Rule out a Large Acquisition at Cisco? &gt;&gt; We always want to be careful not comment on Rumors and direction but we are very predict Theable. We've acquired nine companies this year, we Acquire Small Company can, ideal Target 100 Engineers moving into New Technology such as with the Kiss Acquisition for Lynxs. The Acquisition very successful. You Acquire Large to Small, you partner Large to Large so when we think about Large companies halfway around the World, dramatically different Culture, Et Cetera it Extremely unlikely it would be any Truth those Type of Rumors but I wouldn't comment on those but if I would Bet Ton, I would Bet against it. David: John, --. &gt;&gt; Hawaii David, how you doing. David: I'm Fine. Lump together with this Debate about expensing Options that will become the Rule for many companies the end of this year. Do you believe Options are a cash expense? &gt;&gt; Well, I think we will Report anyway or Shareholders Wabts us to Report, of course we will comply with all Govern Regulations to go with it. So I do believe that Stocks personally, Stock Options are an Expeps, I do not. I believe they are Reflected in the Dilution of your shares. Having said that, I do understand the Majority of People do so Industry no problem reporting it in that Format, I just hope they ask us to Report in a and a half Reflects what the Options are really Worth because Overstating the expenses can be as Bad as under stating them in that Drik but we will provide all of the above. David: You do spend cash in order Sthaem Dilution from the option by Employees do not so that is Real cash I would Assume it is an expense? &gt;&gt; Well if you look at it I have no problem expensing it David for those that Wont want to do that and Goal in a Hodgecle Fashion. Buy back shares when Mows Exercise Orpgs that dramatically cuts Dill Louis so if you pass out 2% Of Options to flows and buy it back when you Costumers the Stock you about cut that 2% And would Good Gain back to 1/2 of 1% Dilution so we will guy all the above and Leapt the Market determine the Proper expense of Valuation over time. David: Thank you. Maria: John, thank you so much for being with us, John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Live in San Jose in California. And thanks to Jim Goldman. Up next, the Squawkback question of the day, where do you see the Federal Reserve stopping Interest rates? Go to the Westbound Site, CNBC on MSN. We will bring you the Answers right after this.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Each day in one of the main halls a crowd gathered, huddling in front of a stage upon which stood a structure that appeared at first glance like a gallows. Above a platform rose a tall structure of wooden boards with ropes hanging off to both sides. As workmen took the strain, pulling the ropes taut, the platform rose bearing the inventor Elisha Otis as well as barrels and heavy boxes, until it reached 30 feet above the heads of the throng.</p><p>After a dramatic pause an assistant cut the hoists with an axe and the crowds gasped as they expected to see the engineer crash to the ground. But the platform only dropped a few inches and remained there, suspended in the air, held by Otis's patented safety device, the \"safety hoister.\" Above the murmur of astonishment, Otis assured his stunned audience, \"all safe, gentlemen, all safe.\" It was a spectacle that changed the history of the world. Otis had not invented the elevator, but had made it safe. Before Otis's innovation, few places in the world-apart from Sana'a, in Yemen-had buildings over five storeys high; within 50 years there were skyscrapers overlooking Manhattan.</p><p>Cities and technology have long influenced each other. Otis's elevator was invented at the same time as innovations in railways, sewers and steel manufacture; combined they would determine the shape and scale of the modern city. Today, we are experiencing a new technological leap: the intelligent city, which is being heralded with the same fevered, messianic optimism and hard sell as Stephenson's Rocket or Bazalgette's sewers. To be smart is to be modern, we are told; a failure to embrace the liberating power of information is to be morally suspect. But this poses the question of what precisely the role of technology might be in the modern city. Can it turn a leaden metropolis into a sustainable, robust utopia?</p><p>For some urban thinkers, the solution to all our current problems is to start again, from scratch. Songdo, in South Korea, is an example of the next generation of metropolis: a smart city, built according to the new rules of the Information Age. Built from reclaimed land 40 miles southwest of Seoul, it is a connected city, in which information is gathered and used to regulate the urban fabric. Buildings, objects, traffic lights are both sensors and activators. This type of city is no longer a static collection of places but \"a computer in open air.\" It is a sentient place-a living and connected matrix in which buildings, signs, users and vehicles communicate with each other in real time.</p><p>Songdo's promotional brochure notes that the city appropriates the canals of Venice, Hong Kong's skyline, the park areas from Savanna Georgia and Napoleon's sense of street planning, and mixes it all up together. Beneath this architectural melee the city is wired with Cisco's proprietory U.City infrastructural software, meaning that Songdo can be run from a hub that functions as the city's \"brain stem,\" gathering data from the sensors scattered throughout the city.</p><p>Street cameras watch the human flow to brighten the energy-saving street lamps that shut down when no one is around. Sensors surveil street traffic, collecting registration plate data to monitor congestion. Buildings, bridges and infrastructure are connected to avoid unexpected works or delays. On top of buildings, mini stations predict the weather, sending warnings when temperatures drop to a level that might cause a surge in energy use for heating. All waste, rubbish, energy use and water is metered and measured, offering potential ways to reduce inefficiencies.</p><p>Is this an efficiency dream? Or a control nightmare? It's hard to decide. The modernist era saw planned cities such as Braslia, Canberra and Chandrigarh, built from the dirt, as well as the more local post-war new town plans of Peterlee, Welwyn Garden City and Washington. Each was created as an expression of hope for the future-so what do smart cities tell us about ourselves?</p><p>In addition to Songdo, new cities are appearing everywhere. Masdar City has been created outside Abu Dhabi by Norman Foster as the first carbon-free city. In China there are numerous plans for eco-cities that harness information technology to make more sustainable environments. Often the techno-utopian claims made for such cities need to taken with a pinch of salt. Most of us will never live in cities created out of the desert. The prospective populations of these cities are minute compared to the majority of the global population that already lives within the dense, complex, and often straining-at-the-limits cities built from bricks, stones, steel and lives of the pre-Information Age. These cities face the challenge of adapting as best as possible to advances in technology even though they are poorly positioned to do so.</p><p>In November 2010, David Cameron announced the launch of Tech City, an initiative that hoped to turn a stretch of east London-from Shoreditch to Stratford-into the technology capital of Europe. The dilapidated post-industrial East End was to be transformed into a new gleaming smart hub: Silicon Roundabout, named after the Old Street roundabout. So did it work?</p><p>Within a year of Cameron's announcement, Tech City had attracted huge attention from international companies. The high profile push has raised the international standing of the project. For big tech companies looking for a place to site their European office, the publicity drive has worked. However, local start-ups have lost out, and with them has gone an important source of innovation. According to Elizabeth Varley, founder of TechHub, a hugely successful community workspace close by Old Street roundabout, the top-down initiative needs to be questioned. Around the roundabout itself there has been little investment: the tube station, one of the least attractive in the city, has not been improved. There has not even been an upgrade to the neighbourhood's broadband capacity. There are fears that the main effect of government cheerleading will be to raise rents.</p><p>According to Varley, the most urgent matter was the lack of government investment-but in the people rather than the place, with small grants \"so that a young entrepreneur can eat for six months.\" A 2012 report by the Centre for London put the case for development from the ground-up rather than a policy to attract outside investment. The report concluded: \"It has been evolving for years under the policy radar, and only now-as it reaches critical mass, and becomes the figurehead of London's digital economy-is it receiving much public attention... Tech City should be about taking what inner East London already has and helping it get even better.\"</p><p>Other British cities are adapting to new technology. In November 2012 Birmingham announced its Smart City Vision, which confronted precisely this challenge. Despite having the youngest population in the UK, 18.5 per cent of Birmingham's adult population still has no access to the internet. Overcoming this is the first step. Second, local government should become more efficient and find new ways to deliver services and share more between departments. There will also be a commitment to smart energy use, intelligent architecture and infrastructure planning-out with the old Victorian systems, in with the new.</p><p>The promise made by Birmingham's Smart City Vision was that: \"Technology will be seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of our city life to provide better information, more choice, more convenience and less waste for our citizens, businesses, communities and public services.\"</p><p>The optimism and sense of ambition is laudable, as was the Victorian mission to provide clean water, sewers, and fresh air. But these plans are expensive. The installation of meters to measure energy and water usage has a price; there is no guarantee that \"ultra fast digital connectivity\" will attract \"inward investment, create jobs and drive innovation.\" This \"joined up, integrated and citizen-centric approach across city systems and processes, using and sharing real time data and intelligence\" might lead to better decision making. But this is dependent on the quality of the people making the decisions, not just the size of the data set.</p><p>Amsterdam Smart City, launched in 2009. Like Birmingham, it is looking to upgrade its infrastructure. One lesson concerned the willingness of residents to take in the technological developments that were occurring around them. The lesson of Amsterdam is that citizens' tolerance for high-tech lectures from city officials is low.</p><p>Big schemes like this have to come from city hall, but they must be promoted with caution; both Birmingham and Amsterdam propose widespread top-down schemes that risk promising too much.</p><p>In addition, the intelligent city must not become a cage. The amount of security technology installed in London in advance of the 2012 Olympic was astounding. In Rio de Janeiro, in preparation for the 2014 World Cup, the city has worked with IBM to create an all-seeing information hub that collects data and could be the nerve centre during an emergency. It can also be used to watch and monitor the city from every angle.</p><p>Most of the major software companies have developed the proprietary code to make and market the future metropolis. Big players such as IBM, Cisco, Siemens, Phillips, and GE are entering the debate on the intelligent city. These big companies are talking to city halls, offering end-to-end solutions, the complete package to retrofit the everyday city for the 21st century.</p><p>Some of the most interesting ideas are coming from the MIT SENSEable Lab, run by the architect and designer Carlo Ratti. Ratti's team at MIT has looked at a number of projects that help the gathering together of huge sources of information that allow us to understand the city-not how we think it might work but how it actually, empirically functions. One project used small GPS monitors to find out where our trash ended up. Starting in Seattle, the team discovered that parts of the city's trash travelled thousands of miles, some items even crossing borders before being discarded.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Copenhagen Wheel, an attractively designed add-on to the back wheel of an ordinary bike, works both as a miniature engine that stores energy for those moments when you need a little help, and a multi-sensor that gathers data on your performance, traffic and air pollution. Simple devices like this could have as large an impact as the massive city-wide public infrastructure projects.</p><p>However, in the hope of developing the intelligent city, perhaps the most radical gesture is also the cheapest. City governments have been gathering data for decades; the use of information technology will make this easier, faster and bigger. But who owns this information? In 2009 Mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the New York City Open Data archive that made copious amounts of city data public. In 2010 Mayor Boris Johnson did the same in London; and since then has been followed by numerous cities around the world.</p><p>The datastore is not just a mechanism for transparency. While it is important that the city government proves itself to be open and accountable, establishing a sense of trust between the city and city hall, the variety of information being offered to general scrutiny has a far more valuable potential in engaging the active citizen. Once data is made available, city hall loses control on how that information is used, and by whom: hackers, activists, website designers, coders or app entrepreneurs. It can be utilised to start a political campaign or launch a new business.</p><p>This donation of the control of information by the traditional government powers to whoever has a broadband connection and a special interest is perhaps the start of the real intelligent city.</p><p>Leo Hollis is an urbanist and historian.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Watts, R-Okla., must have had deja vu on Monday. As he had done dozens of times while a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma, Watts gathered teammates together, loaded them on a bus and sent them out to do battle. The team - a gaggle of GOP leaders - traveled from Capitol Hill to Virginia's tech-heavy Dulles corridor. The lawmakers visited companies there to see how they might help in the contest between cyber-criminals blitzing the Internet and cyber-security firms intent on blocking them. But for Watts, the deja vu ends there. For one thing, this is no game. The FBI says cybercrime costs companies and government $ 10 billion a year. And in a survey by the Computer Security Institute, 90% of companies polled said they've had a computer security breach in the last year. For another thing, the Internet industry's top firms have told federal legislators something Watts' coach, Barry Switzer, never imagined saying: \"Ride the bench.\" Despite recent high-profile attacks in which hackers hobbled major sites like EBay and Yahoo, big tech companies haven't haven't embraced stronger cybercrime laws. \"I do think we already have sufficient laws\" to deal with cyber-security, said Michael Hershman, head of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, a security consulting firm. Some sound a more strident tone. Officials from Microsoft and Cisco Systems recently told a joint House-Senate panel on cybercrime that the industry can take care of itself. Howard Schmidt, Microsoft's chief information security officer, cautioned against any \"unnecessary outside regulation or interference in the operation of dynamic, very productive businesses.</p><p>\"Infrastructure security does not lend itself to government management,\" he said. The White House heard the same line when it brought 20 Internet industry executives together with academics and government officials just after major hacking attacks in February. After the meeting, White House officials said the industry representatives didn't ask for new legislation to fight back against hackers. When you consider the numbers, the industry's reluctance to pursue cyber-criminals seems funny. Cybercrime already has a broad impact. Just one prominent example, the Melissa virus of 1999, caused $ 80 million in damage worldwide. In a December incident, 300,000 credit card numbers were pulled from the databanks at CD Universe and posted on the Web. And the problem is expected to get worse. As more Internet users connect through high-speed modems such as cable and DSL lines, they'll be on the Net nearly nonstop. This will give hackers thousands more computers whose data they can dip into or whose Internet links they can exploit to commit crimes. The attackers are as varied as the crimes. Some are disgruntled employees looking to sabotage systems. Some are criminals looking to steal data and hold it for ransom. And some are teen-agers vandalizing a site for fun or cracking a company's security to expose its flaws. That vast potential number of cyber-attackers makes preventing cyberattacks almost impossible. The National Computer Security Center says 64% of U.S. corporations, government agencies and universities have already been victims of cybercrime. That's made fighting off attacks a 24-hour job for some. Like many of its members, the National Association of Securities Dealers says its Nasdaq.com Web pages are under constant assault. \"We have 20 to 30 hacks ongoing at any given time,\" said Larry Bickner, vice president of information security for the association. Its response: more and more security programs to catch as many hackers as possible before they can do any damage. Given the rising costs, why haven't companies sought more government help in nabbing hackers? Some credit Silicon Valley's laissez-faire leanings. But there may be other concerns. \"Companies just want to recover as much money as they can and slap the person on the wrist and get it over with,\" said Chuck Bowe, a risk management expert at KPMG. \"They don't want to take action against the people they catch, because their customers will flee over the publicity.\" Indeed, the FBI says only 17% of the victims of cybercrime report the crimes committed against them. There's good reason to worry about bad publicity. When E-Trade Group, EBay, Buy.com and Amazon.com were among those hit in February, it made news across the country. Competitors know this, so they use hacking incidents against each other. When Russian mobsters pilfered $ 10 million from Citibank last year, the competition played it up. And they did so even though Citibank got back virtually all of the money. In addition to bad publicity from a public hunt for cyber-criminals, there's also a morass of private data issues to be considered. Among them: Should an Internet Service Provider open its logs to federal investigators? Will client confidentiality be compromised if the FBI checks through an e-commerce site's files? For now the industry seems content to take its chances. Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, told Congress the industry has \"reservations about working too closely with the federal law enforcement and national security community and has concerns about jeopardizing business concerns by sharing information on security issues.\" Clearly the industry has reason to be concerned about federal intervention in cyber-security. While nearly all of the Net's infrastructure is private, government agencies use it a lot. Nearly 25% of all computers sold each year, for instance, go to government agencies. That risk helped lead the GOP team to the Dulles corridor Monday, and has led other lawmakers and agencies to propose beefed-up security measures. Among them: Several senators and representatives are backing proposals to create a federal clearinghouse for sharing information on cyberattacks. The clearinghouse would be protected against Freedom of Information requests and privacy liability. The FBI is doubling its force of digital investigators. It plans to have cybercrime units in all of its 56 field offices within two years. The Clinton administration wants $ 91 million for new technologies to combat cyber-terrorism. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is pushing a bill to double penalties for serious hacking offenses to 10 years in prison for the first offense and 20 for a second offense. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and others have introduced bills to give the FBI and other federal agencies more powers to investigate cybercrime around the world. Other initiatives would let federal investigators and prosecutors begin their work at the beginning of a hacking case. Under current law, you have to show more than $ 5,000 in damages before federal prosecution can start. Even with all the new proposals, federal officials have made it clear that they think private industry will have to look after itself. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told a joint House-Senate cyber-security panel that \"we in government will not be able to solve all these problems. We believe the private sector should take the lead in protecting private computer networks.\" Alan Paller, a director at the SANS Institute, a research group linking nearly 100,000 computer managers and security professionals, hopes to do just that. SANS is promoting through its Web site free security tools that help prevent the kind of hacking that shut down Yahoo and crippled EBay, E-Trade and Amazon.com in February. While such measures aren't new, major Internet companies have been slow to adopt them because of cost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4001-BFJ0-003M-X0HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1270\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>April 4, 2000</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

GOLD IS DOWN 5 PERCENT, SILVER, DOWN ABOUT 10 PERCENT, AND THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE. DENNIS GARTMAN WAS MAKING A COMMENT IN HIS MORNING NOTE TO HIS CLIENTS SAYING CHINESE STOCKS UNDER PRESSURE, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE GOLD MIGHT BE UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE THE CHINESE ARE VERY INVOLVED IN THE GOLD BUSINESS. &gt;&gt;&gt; AS FAR AS THE STOCK MARKET GOES TODAY, WE'RE SEEING A SLIGHT BIAS TOWARDS MORE DEFENSIVE STOCKS BUT NOT DRAMATICALLY SO. YOU LOOK AT YOUR USUAL SUSPECTS LIKE WAL-MART, KROGER, COKE, PEPSI, BUDWEISER, ALL VERY FRACTIONALLY POSITIVE OR VERY FRACTIONALLY NEGATIVE. WAL-MART, BY THE WAY, IS CONSIDERED A DEFENSIVE STOCK, CONSIDERED A CONSUMERS STAPLES, EVEN THOUGH TARGET ISN'T AND I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN ISSUE WITH THAT. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE CYCLICALS, THEY'RE TO THE DOWNSIDE BUT NOT DRAMATICALLY SO, CUMMINS, DEERE, U.S. STEEL, PROBABLY ON THE POSITIVE SIDE BY NOW, AND -- YES. I WOULD CALL THIS A SLIGHT BIAS TOWARDS THE DEFENSIVE STOCKS. &gt;&gt;&gt; FINALLY, THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, REMEMBER THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRADING GLITCHES DOWN HERE, YESTERDAY THE CEO JOHN THAIN TOLD ME THEY WERE MAKING UPGRADES TO THE MESSAGING SYSTEM OVERNIGHT, THEY'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE WEEK AND -- WEEKEND AND SAID MORE CAPACITY WOULD BE ADDED TO THE HAND-HELD MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME SLOWNESS HERE ON THE FLOOR, SO UPGRADES COMING OVER THE WEEKEND. &gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO REBECCA JARVIS STANDING BY AT THE NASDAQ. &gt;&gt; WE DID SEE SELLING AT THE OPEN HERE AS WELL, NOW WE'RE SEEING A REBOUND IN SOME NAMES, PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE BIG TECH NAMES. DELL SHARES MOST NOTABLY TO THE UPSIDE BY ALMOST A PERCENT, CRUMMY EARNINGS, A DOWNGRADE, A LOT OF AACTIVITY IN THE STOCK, IN FACT, 275 PERCENT, THE NORMALITY OF TRADING.

NOW TALKING TO FEDERAL REGULATORS ABOUT THEIR STOCKS, ABOUT THE COMBINED COMPANY. XM SATELLITE TODAY SAYING THAT THAT COMBINED COMPANY WILL STILL ALLOW XM SATELLITE RADIO CUSTOMERS TO GET XM SATELLITE RADIO ON THE NEW COMPANY'S PROGRAM. &gt;&gt;&gt; AMGEN SHARES ALSO TRADING TO THE UPSIDE TODAY. THEY'RE UP .5%. NOW, THE REASON THERE IS THEY GOT AN UPGRADE. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS STORY FROM MIKE HUCKMAN LATER IN THE HOUR. &gt;&gt;&gt; AND XILINX, GETTING AN UPGRADE BUT IT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THE SHARES, THEY'RE DOWN JUST SLIGHTLY, 3/10 OF A PERCENT, UPPED AT MERRILL LYNCH TODAY. &gt;&gt;&gt; INTUIT SHARES, THEY ARE REFLEAGHTING -- REFLECTING THEIR UPGRADE, GETTING THE UPGRADE FROM CIBC, UP .6%. &gt;&gt;&gt; ONE IMPORTANT DOWNGRADE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY, HYPE PEERON SOLUTIONS.

THEY WERE ONE OF THE BIG WINNERS AND NOW DOWN .2%. ONE LAST DOWNGRADE, THE NASDAQ SHARES OF THE NASDAQ ITSELF, DOWN 1.2%. THEY WERE DOWNGRADED THIS MORNING OVER AT -- LET ME MAKE SURE I GET THIS, J.P. MORGAN. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAD TO MARK HAINES. MARK: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LET'S SCROLL DOWN FURTHER ON -- DRILL DOWN FURTHER ON THE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, BRINGING OKAY ECONOMICS REPORTER STEVE, THE OLD PROFESSOR, LIESMAN, ALSO THE \"SQUAWK BOX\" COANCHOR JOE KERNEN. GENTLEMEN, I REMAIN FIRMLY IN THE CATCH I'VE BEEN IN FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. JOE: I'M LOSING MY MOJO A LITTLE, MARK. MARK: YEAH? JOE: A LITTLE BIT. AFTER CASHIN, YOU TALK TO -- THE ONLY THING I'M SURE OF NOW, MARK, IS THAT I DON'T THINK WE GO DOWN EXACTLY 10 PERCENT, AND THEN TURN AROUND AND RESUME THE BULL MARKET. I'M SURE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. NOW, HOWEVER YOU CONFOUND THAT CONSENSUS THINKING, I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER ANYTHING. YOU KNOW, DOWN WHATEVER OR IMMEDIATELY BACK UP. YOU'RE STILL FEELING PRETTY GOOD. IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK EVERYWHERE ON THE PLANET NOW, MARK. ANYTHING ANYWHERE, CASHIN USED THE ANALOGY OF THE BUTTERFLY IN SOUTH AMERICA, YOU KNOW, CAUSING A HURRICANE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SOMEWHERE. WE'VE GOT TO BE EXPERTS AT EVERYTHING TO DECIDE.

PLUS GOOGLE AND AMAZON STOCKS CONTINUE TO RALLY...ARE WE SEEING ANOTHER INTERNET STOCK BUBBLE? AND IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY. WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR THE FAMILY THAT CONTROLS DOW JONES AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AS THEY CONSIDER A BUYOUT OFFER. WHILE WELCOMING EVERYBODY HERE WE GO NOW ON THIS THURSDAY MORNING THE 26 OF JULY 2007 HAD AN AWFULLY BUSY COUPLE OF DAYS HERE FOR INVESTORS OF A GLOWING IN THE MARKET AND WHERE SEEING SOME TENTATIVE BUYING BUT ALSO SOME SELLING TO. RIGHT AND THERE'S SOME LARGE DAILY RANGES HERE ON THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE TO THAT MEANS THE VOLATILITY OF COURSE IS RETURNING TO THE MARKET HAD THE GOOD THING IS THAT YOU REALLY SEE ANY PANIC SELLING GOING ON RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF MEASURED RIGHT NOW.

HERE'S A THOUGHT OUR FIRST LOOK MARKET CALENDAR WHEN WILL WE ABOUT THE THE THE Y OF TRADING AHEAD OF US LARRY LEVIN READY TO ROLL THE CME FROM SECRETSOFTRADERS.COM AND STILL THINK WE HAVE SEE IF THESE LOWS FROM YESTERDAY'S STILL HOLD? I THINK SO OBVIOUS IN THE TRADE BENEFITS TO 11 THE SEPTEMBER FUTURES CONTRACT IN THE S&amp;P IS THAT IT WILL DO MORE OF THE SAME TODAY WE REALLY SEEM TO SEE MORE TESTING OF THOSE LOVELY AS A CRITIC CUT DOWN A BIT OF TRADE AND THE 15 OUR TENURE WE HAVE SEEM MORE BUYERS AGAINST TODAY BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE IT MAY NOT HAPPEN AND GO DOWN TO 1500 LEVEL. EDISON WILL SEE THE PRICES AGAIN. SO NOT 15111510 PERHAPS ALL THE WAY DOWN IF GROUND EVEN #1500? ESPECIALLY FORGET ABOVE WHAT 76 AND A HALF AND IT WILL CONTRACT AND GET EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT WE COULD REALLY SEE SOME SELLING PRESSURE COMBAT IN THIS MARKET. ENERGY PRICES HIGH AS THEY HAVE OF COURSE BEEN IN THE HOUSING MARKET AS A WEEK HAS BEEN FEEDING THE BEARS NOW RIGHT? THAT DELAYED THE HOUSING REPORT IS THAT THEY OUGHT TO CONCERN ABOUT MAIKOP CHICAGO TIME. ALL OF US REALLY BIG IN THE FUTURES ANALYST IN THE EQUITIES AS WELL IS THAT A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION OF WE FIND BUYERS? A THING SO AUGUST TO ONE SEE THESE MOVES HAVE DONE HIGH-VOLUME HIGH- VOLUME MOVES ARE ONES WE CAN TRUST SO A HIGHLY MOBILE AND THE SITUATION WHICH THE NET BUYERS ON THE LOW AND REALLY BEEN A GOOD SITUATION. WHAT TO THE CHURCH DOOR TO THE LOWS THERE LARRY LEVIN OF THE SECRETSOFTRADERS.COM MORNING BRIEFING WHILE MANY PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY IN RETIREMENT, AMERICANS HAVE MORE THAN $16 TRILLION SOCKED AWAY FOR THEIR GOLDEN YEARS. ABOUT HALF OF THAT IS INVESTED IN COMPANY-SPONSORED 401-K PLANS AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS...I-R-AS. THE INVESTMENT COMPANY INSTITUTE FINDS RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS HAVE JUMPED ALMOST 55% SINCE THE BEAR MARKET OF 2002. IT HAS BEEN A RECORD BREAKING YEAR FOR CORPORATE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, BUT THE BUYOUT BINGE COULD BE TESTING THE LIMITS OF LENDERS. SOME $300 BILLION IN DEBT IS NEEDED TO FUND MANY BUYOUTS, INCLUDING CHRYSLER AND ELECTRONIC PAYMENT COMPANY FIRST DATA GOING PRIVATE. THE $12 BILLION IN BONDS NEEDED FOR CHRYSLER AUTO TO GO PRIVATE HAS BEEN DELAYED TWICE. AND FINANCING FOR THE $29 BILLION FIRST DATA PURCHASE HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK TO SEPTEMBER. EVEN AS STATES PUSH NEW ANTI- SMOKING RULES AND INCREASE TAXES ON CIGARETTES, CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING BILLS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO REGULATE TOBACCO FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE FDA COULD CONTROL LEVELS OF TAR AND NICOTINE AND FURTHER RESTRICT ADVERTISING. IN LIGHT OF THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES DURING THE SUBPRIME CRISIS WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF. THERE IS ONE RAY OF HOPE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS... A LOCAL MORTGAGE BROKER.. HERE IN CHICAGO... JUST STARTED A PROGRAM TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET A HEAD START ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HOME OWNERSHIP. DARCY SHEPARD.. A MORTGAGE SPECIALIST IS REACHING OUT TO CHICAGO'S YOUTH... IN HOPES OF INSPIRING THEM TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS I PLANT THE SEED OF WHAT A MORTGAGE IS.. HOW TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON IT TALK ABOUT DELAYED GRATIFICATION PUTTING ASIDE MONEY.. DON'T SPEND FRIVOLOUS THINGS.. THAT WILL MAKE YOU A STRONGER HOMEOWNER ONE OF THE REASONS SHE PUT THIS PROGRAM TOGETHER IS TO EDUCATE STUDENTS...

Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.</p><p>The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc. said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.</p><p>The Dow Jones transportation index edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.</p><p>The National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.</p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.</p><p>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.</p><p>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:</p><p>- Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.</p><p>- Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.</p><p>- Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

OVERSEAS INVESTORS HAD A PROFITABLE DAY IN ASIA BUT IN EUROPE, THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE UPWARD TREND IN U.S. MARKETS. AT THE SAME TIME DETROIT IS SELLING CARS AGAIN AND IT HAS THE GOVERNMENT TO THANK, IMAGINE THAT. CHRIS COTTER FROM FOX BUSINESS NEWS HAS DETAILS LIVE FROM NEW YORK. </p><p>GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; SO. LET'S GET INTO THE, THE CASH FOR CLUNKERS THIS MORNING. THE SENATE IS, IS STILL DEBATING ITS MERITS BUT DETROIT, YOU KNOW, SAID TO BE PRETTY HAPPY. THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO CLEAR OUT THE INVENTORY, BUT, IS THIS, IS THIS GOING TO JUMPSTART CAR PRODUCTION? &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE BIG THING. WE HAVE TODAY TO GET IT DONE, THE SENATE HAS TO APPROVE AN ADDITIONAL $2 BILLION, OTHERWISE, THE PROGRAM COMES TO A COMPLETE HALT, AND THAT TALK OF, THE INCREASING PRODUCTION OR FORGETTING PRODUCTION STARTED EARLIER THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT GOES OUT THE WINDOW. AND BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS SHOWS THE DOMINO EFFECT OF, OF, YOU KNOW, STIMULUS HERE, THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. A LOT OF PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER IT'S WORTH IT OR WHETHER WE WANT GOVERNMENT SPENDING. IT'S ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL. TAKING SOME OF THE 187 BILLION APPROVED AND TAKING IT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PUTTING IT TOWARDS THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY HERE, AND IT WORKS. THERE IS A DOMINO EFFECT GOING BACK TO SUPPLIERS, UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM TO THE DEALERSHIPS, AND THEY ARE ALL, ALL BENEFITING FROM IT, AND, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT MULTIPLIER EFFECT WITH THE DOLLAR. IT'S WORKING, WE'RE GOING TO SEE INCREASED PRODUCTION ACROSS THE BOARD, AND WE HAVE INVENTORY THAT HAS BEEN WORKING DOWN, ESPECIALLY AT CHRYSLER. CHRYSLER WAS MATCHING THE 4500 FOR THE FIRST WEEK, AND THEN THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO IT ANY MORE BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF CARS SO THAT WILL RAMP UP BUILDING NEW STARS AND WILL BENEFIT EVERYBODY, ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT THE CHAIN. &gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; SO. THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH IS A POSITIVE THING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE WITH GOVERNMENT SPENDING TO AID IN THE STIMULUS BUT IF YOU DO, THIS IS AS GOOD OF A PLACE TO SPEND THAT MONEY AS ANY. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE MORE FUEL FINGER CARS ON THE ROAD AND HOPEFULLY, MORE WILL BE PRODUCED OUT OF THIS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MARKETS. IT WAS -- &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A MIX IN ASIA AND EUROPE, AND THE FUTURES POINT TO A SLOW OPENING BELL. &gt;&gt; OUR FUTURES ARE DOWN A BIT. THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE HAD IS, IS THIS RUN, AND EVEN YESTERDAY, UP OVER 1,000 ON THE S&amp;P 500, AROUND 150 AND POINTS UP ON THE DOW. YOU ARE GOING TO GET A PULLBACK, AND IT'S HEALTHYING TO THAT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, WHAT YOU HAVE IS, IS UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND OFF A CLIFF. WE DON'T WANT THAT. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE, A COUPLE DAYS TO, TO TAKE A BREATH AND REEVALUATE A BIT AND THEN THAT NEXT LEG UP, THAT'S A HEALTHY MARKET, AND SO, YOU KIND OF, YOU GET THE FEELING THAT THERE IS MORE BULLISH SENTIMENT BUT YOU NEED THE PULLBACK SO THEY WILL START, PROBABLY IN A NEGATIVE TERRITORY. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A FALLING OUT BETWEEN GOOGLE AND APPLE. GOOGLE C.E.O. ERIK SCHMIDT HAS RESIGNED, WE UNDERSTAND, FROM, FROM THE BOARD OF APPLE, AND THIS COMES AS APPLE BANNED GOOGLE APPLICATIONS FROM THE I-PHONE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A LOT MORE TO THIS THAN JUST THE, THE I-PHONE APPS ISSUE. &gt;&gt; WELL, YEAH. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BIG THINGS. YOU MENTIONED, GOOGLE'S C.E.O. HAS BEEN ON THE APPLE BOARD FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, AND HE RESIGNED, A MUTUAL THING. FIRST, THERE ARE REGULATORS THAT, THAT ARE KIND OF NOT SNOOPING AROUND BUT LOOKING AT THE SITUATION WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME, SOME COLLUSIVE ISSUES WITH, WITH HAVING THE, THE C.E.O. OF ONE MASSIVELY BIG TECH COMPANY ON THE BOARD OF ANOTHER MASSIVELY BIG COMPANY. THE OTHER THING IS, GOOGLE AND DOING A LOT OF THINGS OF APPLE. SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE ERIK SCHULTZ WOULD STEP OUT OF THE ROOM IN BOARD MEETINGS BECAUSE THERE WAS COMPETITIVE, YOU KNOW, ISSUES THERE SO, IT DOES MAKE SENSE THAT GOOGLE IS DOING A LOT WITH THE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBDENG-104665941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBDENG2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W9Y-8PX0-Y8SG-C0Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297753</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 inewsnetwork Inc.

I'LL TELL TELL YOU WHY IN A MINUTE, BUT LEHMAN BROTHERS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, HOLDS $40 BILLION OF THOSE SECURITIES ON ITS BOOKS. HERE YOU SEE LEHMAN BROTHERS TRADING OFF WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER FINANCIALS AND THAT, I HEAR, COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR LEHMAN GOING FORWARD. A LOT OF ANALYSTS SAY THAT WHEN THAT MARKET STARTS TO TEETER, I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE AS BAD AS THE SUBPRIME MARKET AND THAT'S WHEN LEHMAN WHICH HAS ESCAPED ALL THIS, THAT'S WHEN LEHMAN COULD BE IN THE CROSSHAIRS AS WELL. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS SUBPRIME. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IS A SURER MARKET, BUT IF WE DO HAVE A RECESSION, LEHMAN BROTHERSES WILL TAKE IT ON THE CHIN WITH THESE. &gt;&gt; ONE OTHER THING, CHARLIE. WAS BOB RUBIN HAVING LUNCH WITH CHUCK PRINCE YESTERDAY? WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; FROM WHAT I HEAR THEY WERE HAVING LUNCH AT THE FOUR SEASONS. I PREFER SAN PIETRO, I GUESS THEY STAY AWAY FROM MY SPIES, OR THEY THINK THEY DO AT THE FOUR SEASONS. THEY WERE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT THE WRITEDOWN WHICH I HEAR WILL HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY. THEY'LL ANNOUNCE ALL THIS STUFF AND THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW BIG IS THE WRITEDOWN AND WILL THIS LEAD TO LAYOFFS? FROM WHAT I HEAR THE WRITEDOWN WILL BE HUGE. THEY'LL ANNOUNCE SOMETHING LIKE $24 BILLION. THAT'S AN UNCONFIRMED NUMBER, BUT THAT'S WHAT THE SPECULATION IS INTERNALLY AND THE OTHER SPECULATION IS WHAT ARE THEY GOING DO WITH LAYOFFS AND I THINK THAT'S A WILD CARD. I THINK, CLEARLY, MIDDLE MANAGERS HAVE BEEN TOLD AND WE REPORTED THIS EARLY, COME UP WITH LAYOFFS SOMEWHERE IN THE 5 TO 10% RANGE OF CITIGROUP'S 370,000 PEOPLE, BUT THE QUESTION IS DO THEY ACTUALLY TAKE THAT? I THINK THERE'S DEBATE INTERNALLY WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE MODEL. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. ALSO, QUICKLY, WE'VE SEEN ALLEN SCHWARTZ'S FIRST COMMENTS OVER BEAR STEARNS, IF THERE'S A PLAY FOR BEAR, WHO MIGHT NUMBER PLAY? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS IS COMPLETELY SPECULATION. I'M GETTING THIS THREE STEPS REMOVED. TO BREAK THIS STORY YOU HAVE TO SPEAK MANDARIN CHINESE, I BARELY SPEAK EDGE HEAR/, DON'T CAN ME TO SPEAK MANDARIN CHINESE. I HEAR SENIOR PEOPLE IN CITIC HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUYING A BIGGER STAKE, MAYBE BUYING ALL OF BEAR STEARNSAND THERE ARE A LOT OF POLITICAL AND HURDLES TO JUMP THROUGH, BUT IT MAKES SENSE ON A COUPLE OF LEVELS. NUMBER ONE, NO U.S. BANK WOULD TOUCH BEAR STEARNSIN ITS STATE. IT'S GOT A HUGE PROBLEM HERE IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS MODEL. I THINK EUROPEAN BANKS WOULD BE SKEPTICAL AS WELL. WHY GO FOR THE FIRM THAT'S THE MOST IN TROUBLE, BUT THE CHINESE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BUY A U.S. INVESTMENT BANK. THEY HAVE A FOOTHOLD IN BEAR STEARNS. THEY MAY ROLL THE DICE WITH THIS COMPANY WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IN BAD SHAPE. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE, THANKS A LOT. WE'LL SEE WHAT REGULATORS HAVE TO STAY ABOUT THAT. CHARLIE GASPARINO. SUE'S LET'S SEND IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; WE'D LOVE TO HAVE MR. PRINCE AND MR. RUBIN JOIN US FUR LUNCH IN THE FOUR SEASONS WHEN WE DO OUR SHOW THERE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. FEEL FREE TO HAVE LUNCH AGAIN, GENTLEMEN AND COME ON OUR SHOW. MEANTIME, AS YOU KNOW, HUNDREDS OF DEALS HAVE BEEN MADE THIS WEEK AT THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW IN LAS VEGSA. IT'S WHERE SMALL BUSINESS MEETS OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE GADGETS OF TODAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME THE BIG TECH COMPANIES OF TOMORROW. TONIGHT'S SPECIAL, BIG IDEA, IT'S THE INSIDER'S GUIDE TO SUCCESS. THE GRAND FINALE OF THE MEGA ROAD TO CES SERIES THAT DONNY HAS BEEN DOING. TONIGHT WATCH AS FOUR PIONEERING ENTREPRENEURS FIND OUT IF THEY WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT TECH COMPANY. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU THINK THE MEETING WENT? &gt;&gt; DONNY, I THOUGHT THE MEETING WAS TERRIFIC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBDENG-94222137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBDENG2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4RJH-F7S0-TW7J-30KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297753</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 inewsnetwork Inc.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Companies that change ownership usually face strict limits on how much of a loss they can defer. But Treasury granted AIG an exemption, handing the company $17.7 billion in profit, the former panel members said.</p><p>Damon Silvers, former vice chairman of the oversight panel, said the tax break unfairly benefits private AIG stockholders, including executives who were paid in stock options, at the expense of taxpayers.</p><p> \"By doing it this way, substantial amounts of money leaked out to the benefit of private parties who really should not be benefiting from public policy in this way,\" Silvers said. He said the waiver gives AIG an unfair competitive advantage.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>          LEGAL          Yahoo sues Facebook over patents          </p><p>Yahoo is filing a lawsuit against Facebook over patents, following through on a threat it made last month.</p><p>Yahoo said in a court filing Monday that Facebook has infringed 10 of its patents covering advertising, privacy controls and social networking.</p><p>Yahoo threatened to sue Facebook last month, insisting that the social network license its patents.</p><p>Facebook said it is disappointed in Yahoo and pledges to defend itself vigorously against what it calls \"puzzling actions.\"</p><p>The patent claims could cast a spotlight on Facebook's vulnerabilities as it tries to complete an initial public offering of stock this spring.

PETER: IT WAS THE BEST SUPER BOWL GAME I WATCHED. IT WAS AMAZING. ALEXIS: ME, TOO. WE'RE HAVING SOME DISPUTES ABOUT THE JETS-COLTS SUPER BOWL IN THE CONTROL ROOM. ANYHOW, IT'S SUPER TUESDAY TODAY AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL MITT ROMNEY IS STILL CRITICIZING JOHN MCCAIN FOR HIS POSITIONS ON TAX CUTS AND HIS LACK OF BUSINESS BACKGROUND. BUT MCCAIN IS STILL LEADING IN THE POLLS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR THE ECONOMY STILL PLAYS IN TODAY'S CONTEST AND WHAT CANDIDATES PLAN TO DO ABOUT THE DETERIORATING HOUSING MARKET. AND THEN -- THIS IS SO EXCITING -- IT'S HIS 12TH SEASON AS A LAKER. NUMBER 24 IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE LOS ANGELES TEAM HELPED HIM BECOME AN NBA ICON AND HOW HE'S HELPED MARKET THE GAME OF BASKETBALL. KOBE BRYANT IS HERE IN THE STUDIO. AND, OF COURSE, YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS IT. THIS IS LIKE A RIDICULOUSLY FUN DAY FOR ME. [LAUGHTER] PETER: OUR RESIDENT JOCK, ALEXIS GLICK. ALEXIS: THERE YOU GO. PETER: MICROSOFT'S BILLION DOLLARS TAKEOVER BID, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE REGULATORY HURDLE THE SOFTWARE GIANT IS FACING IN GETTING THAT DEAL DONE. PLUS WE'LL LOOK AHEAD IF MICROSOFT GETS THE DEAL DONE, COULD IT CAUSE A RIPPLE EFFECT IN THE TECH SECTOR? WE'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE NEXT BIG TECH DEAL COULD COME FROM. AND WITH RISING FUEL PRICES JACKING UP THE COST OF AIRLINE TICKETS, FREE FOOD ON AIRPLANES SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL. WHILE IN TODAY'S LANDING ZONE, WE'LL TELL YOU WHY JETBLUE IS SERVING UP PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE AT 35,000 FEET. BUT FIRST LET'S CHECK IN WITH CONNELL McSHANE UP AT THE FOX BUSINESS DESK. CONNELL. CONNELL: GOOD MORNING, PETER. WE HAVE NUMBERS FROM DUKE ENERGY. THE NUMBERS ON FIRST GLANCE LOOK TO BE BELOW WHAT THE STREET WAS EXPECTING. 21 CENTS A SHARE IS WHAT DUKE HAS REPORTED. THE AVERAGE ANALYST ESTIMATE WAS FOR EARNINGS OF 24 CENTS. DUK, THE TICKER ON DUKE ENERGY. SO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT STOCK TODAY. NOW, EARNINGS SEASON WINDING DOWN TO SOME EXTENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE REPORTED ALREADY THIS MORNING. IN ADDITION TO THAT NUMBER THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT FROM DUKE ENERGY ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE NUMBERS OUT FROM TYCO INTERNATIONAL, THE CONGLOMERATE WHICH REALLY HANDILY TOPPED WHAT WALL STREET WAS EXPECTING THE COMPANY TO REPORT THIS MORNING. 73 CENTS A SHARE IS WHAT TYCO CAME IN AT. THAT'S A WIDE MARGIN BETTER THAN THE 57 CENTS THAN ANALYSTS HAD BEEN EXPECTING. TYCO REPORTING STRONG PROFIT GAINS ACROSS MOST OF ITS BUSINESSES. PROFIT WAS DOWN MORE THAN 50% FROM A YEAR AGO, BUT THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND WHAT HAVE YOU. EASILY TOPPING WALL STREET EXPECTATIONS FOR TYCO INTERNATIONAL. &gt;&gt;&gt; ALSO OUT OF THE JAPANESE MARKET THIS MORNING, TOYOTA REPORTED AFTER THE JAPANESE MARKETS HAD CLOSED, BUT SOMETHING WE'LL CERTAINLY WATCH WITH ALL THE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES WITH GM AND FORD. TOYOTA'S PROFITS AS YOU SEE THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN, UP YEAR OVER YEAR, UP BY 7-1/2%. A LOT OF PEOPLE BUYING TOYOTA CARS IN CHINA AND RUSSIA. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HELPED THE PROFITS OF TOYOTA. THE EMERGING MARKETS. THE U.S. MARKET IS SLOWING DOWN. SO THE OUTLOOK FROM TOYOTA WAS A BIT CAUTIOUS, IT WAS BELOW WHAT SOME ANALYSTS HAD BEEN EXPECTING. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW, LOOKING BACK AT THE DUKE ENERGY NUMBER I TOLD YOU A MOMENT AGO, WE TOLD YOU IT WAS 21 CENTS A SHARE. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE EX ITEMS NUMBER WHICH WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO WHAT THE STREET WAS LOOKING FOR, MAYBE 27 CENTS A SHARE. IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT'S 3 CENTS BETTER THAN EXPECTATIONS FOR DUKE ENERGY. ALEXIS, BACK TO YOU. ALEXIS: THANKS SO MUCH, CONNELL. FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY HAS BASHED JOHN MCCAIN. IT DIDN'T STOP STEVE FORBES FROM ENDORSING MCCAIN YESTERDAY. IF ECONOMY IS A TOP ISSUE IN THE PRIMARIES, LYING UNDERNEATH IS THE HOUSING AND MORTGAGE MESS. ON THIS SUPER TUESDAY, WE BREAKDOWN THE FOUR FINAL WHITE HOUSE HOPEFULS. MCCAIN, ROMNEY, CLINTON AND OBAMA. HERE TO HELP US IS FOX POLITICAL ANALYST ANDREW. AND BETH IS THE SENIOR EDITOR . GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING. ALEXIS: BETH, LET'S START WITH YOU AND THE HOUSING ISSUE AND THE SUBPRIME CRISIS. IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES FACING AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DOES THAT, THEN, LEND SOME CREDENCE, YOU WOULD THINK, TO HILLARY CLINTON AND MITT ROMNEY WHO HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOUSING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL? &gt;&gt; WELL, I CERTAINLY THINK THAT HILLARY IS GOING TO PLAY IT UP. AND YOU WILL BE HEARING HER TALKING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE SENATE ON FINANCIAL ISSUES AND, YOU KNOW, KNOWING HOW TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO CONGRESS AND WORK WITH CONGRESS ON THESE ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY ROMNEY IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AS GOVERNOR, AS RUNNING THE OLYMPICS IN SALT LAKE CITY. HE'S GOING TO BE TALKIN</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBDENG-95684947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBDENG2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4RS8-NJK0-TW7J-301P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297753</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 inewsnetwork Inc.

ACROSS THE BOARD, DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS, 265 POINTS, DOWN 2%. 28-POINT LOSS FOR THE S&amp;P 500. MORE THAN 2% FOR THE NASDAQ RIGHT NOW, DOWN BY 55 POINTS ON THE DAY. HERE ARE SOME OF THE STOCKS THAT REMOVING. THERE'S ONLY ONE TOP GAINER ON THE DATA CENTER JOHNSON AND JOHNSON. CITIGROUP AND COOK THE SECOND AND THIRD BEST PERFORMERS. GENERAL MOTORS HAD ITS EARNINGS FORECAST CUT TODAY. ON THE S&amp;P, PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STORY. NOT A LOT OF STOCKS PERFORMING. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS GETS AN UPGRADE, SO THEY ARE HIGHER ON THE DAY, BUT LOOKING AT THE LOSERS ON THE DAY, OFFICE DEPOT -- SANDRA WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND HARLEY DAVIDSON SAYS THEY WILL SELL FEWER HOGS. STOCK DOWN 9% FOR BOTH OF THOSE. &gt;&gt; ALL BUT TWO STOCKS IN THE NASDAQ ARE DOWN TODAY. TECHNOLOGY STOCKS ARE THE BIGGEST LOSERS AMONG THEM. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS THE WHOLE DAY, AND I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH. TECHNOLOGY REALLY BEING DRAGGED DOWN. YOU HAVE THE NASDAQ BEING DRAGGED DOWN BY TECHNOLOGY STOCKS. NASDAQ COMPUTER INDEX DOWN 2.3%. THEN YOU HAD XILINX COME OUT AND SAY THAT REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE LITTLE CHANGE FROM LAST QUARTER AND THE SALES WILL BE FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN. THAT DID NOT REALLY HELP OTHER CHIP STOCKS. INTEL IS DOWN ALMOST 3 PERCENT AS WELL. THEN, IT COULD STEEP TERRACED OF THE BIG TECH NAMES. APPLE ALREADY DOWN FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK. IT STARTED OFF ON TUESDAY AT ABOUT $144 A SHARE. RIGHT NOW, WHEN HUNDRED $31. ANALYSTS PUTTING OUT A LOT OF NOTES, WITH THE HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATE FOR THE IPHONE FOR PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT. THEY CALL THAT A GREAT MOVE TO PACIFY CUSTOMERS, UBS SAID IT IS GOING TO COST THEM ABOUT $100 MILLION THIS QUARTER ALONE. THEN, YOU HAVE DEALT LOWER AS WELL, ALMOST 4.5%. BASICALLY MISS ITS REGULATORY FILING DEADLINE. RESEARCHERS SAID THAT THE HAVE THE DATA STORAGE GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF ABOUT 24%, BEATING RIVAL H-P. AND THAT SHOULD HAVE HELPED THE STOCK, BUT NOT REALLY. YOU HAVE BROADER MARKET CONCERNS IMPACTING THEM AS WELL. YOU HAVE RESEARCH IN MOTION COME OUT AND ANNOUNCE A NEW PRODUCT AND NOTHING THAT ANY OF BLACKBERRY CURVE WITH A NEW CBS AND MAPPING SYSTEM. THAT SHOULD HELP THE STOCK, BUT NOT REALLY. IT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY FOR TECHNOLOGY. THE NASDAQ CLIMBED LOWER AND LOWER ON THE BACK OF PRESSURE. THIS IS USUALLY AN INDUSTRY THAT INVESTORS SAY IS A SAFE HAVEN WHEN THERE IS A TIME OF VOLATILE MARKETS, BUT THAT HAS NOT REALLY HAPPENED. BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; TIME NOW TO CHECK IN WITH PIMM FOX. HE IS GOING TO TELL US HOW SMALL AND MID-CAP STOCKS ARE PERFORMING TODAY. LET ME GUESS THE ANSWER. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY. THE RUSSELL 2000 IS ALSO DOWN MORE THAN 1%. PRICELINE.COM, BIOCHEMISTS, ALL LEADING THE INDEX LOWER TODAY. SHARES ARE LOWER BECAUSE OF A JUDGE'S RULING IN A PATENT DISPUTE OVER A GENETIC SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY. LET'S START WITH SOME STOCKS SPECIFICALLY. LET'S LOOK IN SHARES OF CASCADE. THEY ARE CASCADING DOWNWARD. THEY ARE DOWN AS MUCH AS 7%. YOU CAN SEE THIS ON THE CHART. THE REASON -- A DOWNGRADE FROM UNDERPERFORM TO NEUTRAL AND ENTERPRISE STARTED TO GO WITH IT. IN A NOTE TO INVESTORS, DAVIDSON SAID THAT CASCADE'S P/E RATIO MUCH HIGHER THAN ITS HISTORICAL AVERAGE. CASCADE IS THE LARGEST MAKER OF FORKLIFTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET, AND YESTERDAY, THE COMPANY SAID NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER JUMPED 27% ON DEMAND FROM EUROPE AND CHINA. SALES WERE UP 20%. NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING AT TOWN SPORTS. THE FITNESS CLUB STOCK IS DOWN AS MUCH AS 8%. YOU CAN SEE THIS RIGHT HERE. AND THE STOCK WAS RATED A NEW CELL IN YOUR COVERAGE OVER AT BULK OF AMERICA -- BANK OF AMERICA. I NOTE DECLINES, BANK OF AMERICA SAID THAT MARGIN PRESSURE FROM THE ADDITION TO ALL THE NEWS IT IS THEIR OPENING IS NOT NECESSARILY FULLY PRICED INTO THE SHARE PRICE. TOM SPORTS IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST HEALTH CLUB CHAIN, AND IT HAS A STRATEGY OF OPENING HIGH-DENSITY OPERATIONS IN AREAS LIKE NEW YORK AND BOSTON. THEY ARE ACTUALLY NUMBER ONE IN NEW YORK. WHILE THE ALSO TARGET FAMILIES IN THEIR SUBURBAN LOCATIONS.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBDENG-87872760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBDENG2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PM2-XD20-TW7J-306V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297753</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 inewsnetwork Inc.

Shares fell 5.4 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FEI has reported strong sales growth in each of the past four years, benefiting from growth in the electronics and life sciences industries, and had forecast that 2014 could be its first with more than $1 billion in revenue. But the year is off to a tough start, with sales and profits below the company\u2019s forecast range.</p><p>FEI shares fell $1.20 Tuesday, or 1.3 percent, closing at $88.80 before the company reported first-quarter results. FEI fell an additional $8.30 in extended trading.</p><p>\u2014 Mike Rogoway</p><p>SCHNITZER RULING: A federal jury in Portland has determined that Continental Casualty Co. and its subsidiary should pay $8.6 million to cover costs incurred by Portland\u2019s Schnitzer Steel Industries to comply with regulators who oversee the Portland Harbor Superfund site.</p><p>The jury Monday in the court of U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman also said the Illinois-based insurer should pay Schnitzer attorneys\u2019 and consultants\u2019 fees, which haven\u2019t been determined.</p><p>Lawyers for Schnitzer said they could not comment on the case until all legal proceedings are finished. Lawyers for Continental Casualty didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\u2014 Mike Francis</p><p>RITE-AID ACQUISITION: Rite-Aid, the Pennsylvania-based chain of drugstores, has acquired RediClinic, a chain of quick health care clinics inside H-E-B grocery stores in Texas.</p><p>That suggests that the company\u2019s 71 stores in Oregon may soon offer vaccinations, smoking cessation programs, physicals, lipid panels and other quick health care services.</p><p>In general, after being beaten down for a few years, Rite-Aid is again impressing analysts with its plans. \u201cThe company continues to deliver healthy financial performance and improve its growth prospects,\u201d reports Seeking Alpha.</p><p>\u2014 Mike Francis</p><p>$100 MILLION RAISED: New Relic, a San Francisco company that monitors how websites are performing and how visitors are using them, said Monday that it\u2019s raised another $100 million in advance of a widely anticipated initial public stock offering.</p><p>The 6-year-old company made the unusual decision to put its engineering team in Portland, capitalizing on Oregon\u2019s resurgent tech industry to build a large talent base far from Silicon Valley.</p><p>New Relic had previously disclosed $115 million in funding, including an $80 million round 14 months ago. Monday\u2019s investment comes from BlackRock Passport Capital, with additional funding from T. Rowe Price Associates and Wellington Management.</p><p>The company doesn\u2019t disclose financial information but had forecast that revenues would exceed $100 million in 2013.</p><p>\u2014 Mike Rogoway</p><p>browser bug: Windows XP users are getting their first taste of life without security updates after the discovery of a major flaw within the Internet Explorer Web browser.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. issued a warning regarding the flaw, saying it affects Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11. The vulnerability makes it possible for hackers to take control of a user\u2019s computer after it has been infected with malicious code.</p><p>For now, security experts advise that Windows users avoid Internet Explorer until Microsoft issues a patch for the problem, which will likely happen May 13. But that patch will not protect users of Windows XP.</p><p>\u2014 Los Angeles Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>11487247-ou.fei.jg.4986.jpg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OREGNN-MERLIN_24157779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OREGNN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C3M-W791-F08V-61CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Oregonian (Portland Oregon)</publicationName><edition>1M EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>April 30, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Y06</classCode><className>FEI CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00023U9</classCode><className>CONTINENTAL CASUALTY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001ZUK</classCode><className>SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J5M</classCode><className>H E BUTT GROCERY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00044UG</classCode><className>T ROWE PRICE GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS334519 OTHER MEASURING &amp;

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Watts, R-Okla., must have had deja vu on Monday. As he had done dozens of times while a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma, Watts gathered teammates together, loaded them on a bus and sent them out to do battle. The team - a gaggle of GOP leaders - traveled from Capitol Hill to Virginia's tech-heavy Dulles corridor. The lawmakers visited companies there to see how they might help in the contest between cyber-criminals blitzing the Internet and cyber-security firms intent on blocking them. But for Watts, the deja vu ends there. For one thing, this is no game. The FBI says cybercrime costs companies and government $ 10 billion a year. And in a survey by the Computer Security Institute, 90% of companies polled said they've had a computer security breach in the last year. For another thing, the Internet industry's top firms have told federal legislators something Watts' coach, Barry Switzer, never imagined saying: \"Ride the bench.\" Despite recent high-profile attacks in which hackers hobbled major sites like EBay and Yahoo, big tech companies haven't haven't embraced stronger cybercrime laws. \"I do think we already have sufficient laws\" to deal with cyber-security, said Michael Hershman, head of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, a security consulting firm. Some sound a more strident tone. Officials from Microsoft and Cisco Systems recently told a joint House-Senate panel on cybercrime that the industry can take care of itself. Howard Schmidt, Microsoft's chief information security officer, cautioned against any \"unnecessary outside regulation or interference in the operation of dynamic, very productive businesses.</p><p>\"Infrastructure security does not lend itself to government management,\" he said. The White House heard the same line when it brought 20 Internet industry executives together with academics and government officials just after major hacking attacks in February. After the meeting, White House officials said the industry representatives didn't ask for new legislation to fight back against hackers. When you consider the numbers, the industry's reluctance to pursue cyber-criminals seems funny. Cybercrime already has a broad impact. Just one prominent example, the Melissa virus of 1999, caused $ 80 million in damage worldwide. In a December incident, 300,000 credit card numbers were pulled from the databanks at CD Universe and posted on the Web. And the problem is expected to get worse. As more Internet users connect through high-speed modems such as cable and DSL lines, they'll be on the Net nearly nonstop. This will give hackers thousands more computers whose data they can dip into or whose Internet links they can exploit to commit crimes. The attackers are as varied as the crimes. Some are disgruntled employees looking to sabotage systems. Some are criminals looking to steal data and hold it for ransom. And some are teen-agers vandalizing a site for fun or cracking a company's security to expose its flaws. That vast potential number of cyber-attackers makes preventing cyberattacks almost impossible. The National Computer Security Center says 64% of U.S. corporations, government agencies and universities have already been victims of cybercrime. That's made fighting off attacks a 24-hour job for some. Like many of its members, the National Association of Securities Dealers says its Nasdaq.com Web pages are under constant assault. \"We have 20 to 30 hacks ongoing at any given time,\" said Larry Bickner, vice president of information security for the association. Its response: more and more security programs to catch as many hackers as possible before they can do any damage. Given the rising costs, why haven't companies sought more government help in nabbing hackers? Some credit Silicon Valley's laissez-faire leanings. But there may be other concerns. \"Companies just want to recover as much money as they can and slap the person on the wrist and get it over with,\" said Chuck Bowe, a risk management expert at KPMG. \"They don't want to take action against the people they catch, because their customers will flee over the publicity.\" Indeed, the FBI says only 17% of the victims of cybercrime report the crimes committed against them. There's good reason to worry about bad publicity. When E-Trade Group, EBay, Buy.com and Amazon.com were among those hit in February, it made news across the country. Competitors know this, so they use hacking incidents against each other. When Russian mobsters pilfered $ 10 million from Citibank last year, the competition played it up. And they did so even though Citibank got back virtually all of the money. In addition to bad publicity from a public hunt for cyber-criminals, there's also a morass of private data issues to be considered. Among them: Should an Internet Service Provider open its logs to federal investigators? Will client confidentiality be compromised if the FBI checks through an e-commerce site's files? For now the industry seems content to take its chances. Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, told Congress the industry has \"reservations about working too closely with the federal law enforcement and national security community and has concerns about jeopardizing business concerns by sharing information on security issues.\" Clearly the industry has reason to be concerned about federal intervention in cyber-security. While nearly all of the Net's infrastructure is private, government agencies use it a lot. Nearly 25% of all computers sold each year, for instance, go to government agencies. That risk helped lead the GOP team to the Dulles corridor Monday, and has led other lawmakers and agencies to propose beefed-up security measures. Among them: Several senators and representatives are backing proposals to create a federal clearinghouse for sharing information on cyberattacks. The clearinghouse would be protected against Freedom of Information requests and privacy liability. The FBI is doubling its force of digital investigators. It plans to have cybercrime units in all of its 56 field offices within two years. The Clinton administration wants $ 91 million for new technologies to combat cyber-terrorism. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is pushing a bill to double penalties for serious hacking offenses to 10 years in prison for the first offense and 20 for a second offense. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and others have introduced bills to give the FBI and other federal agencies more powers to investigate cybercrime around the world. Other initiatives would let federal investigators and prosecutors begin their work at the beginning of a hacking case. Under current law, you have to show more than $ 5,000 in damages before federal prosecution can start. Even with all the new proposals, federal officials have made it clear that they think private industry will have to look after itself. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told a joint House-Senate cyber-security panel that \"we in government will not be able to solve all these problems. We believe the private sector should take the lead in protecting private computer networks.\" Alan Paller, a director at the SANS Institute, a research group linking nearly 100,000 computer managers and security professionals, hopes to do just that. SANS is promoting through its Web site free security tools that help prevent the kind of hacking that shut down Yahoo and crippled EBay, E-Trade and Amazon.com in February. While such measures aren't new, major Internet companies have been slow to adopt them because of cost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3YYM-41D0-003M-X0B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1270\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>April 4, 2000</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Susan lisovicz is at the 'the New York times' with details. &gt;&gt; it's kind of jarring when you consider the psa's out there sponsored by tobacco companies. </p><p>A new study suggest they are doing everything they can to keep smokers addicted. The study by harvard university finds tobacco companies had been boosting levels of nicotine a substance that makes smoking more addictive and pleasurable. It has an 11% increase in the chemical. The study authors say the increases were, quote, systemic and pervasive and involved all of the manufacturers. The study concludes that the crease was also done by design and it's estimated that 900,000 people become addicted to cigarettes each year. Fred? &gt;&gt; susan, I'm kind of having deja vu. Wasn't this the crux of the william morris case years ago? What are cigarette makers saying about this latest accusation? &gt;&gt; it's nonending. Because, fred, think of all the litigation and all of the warnings. Philip morris which is the world's leading maker of cigarettes issued a statement in response. It provided data on one of its brands only. It says nicotine levels in marlboro cigarettes were -- were the same in 2006 as in 1997. The last year the study looked at, however, was 2005. Anti-smoking activists say the study offers compelling evidence the government should regulate tobacco similar to how the drug industry has to answer to the fda. We will be watching that story. &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; let's follow another story we're watching and the markets. Stocks extending earlier losses. Ben ber notwithstandingy says the nation would case a fiscal crisis. Crude prices not helping. Sometimes it can boost stocks but it's been sliding dramatically this year.

That's the latest from wall street. I'll be back in half an hour with a wrap of the trading day. Fred and don, back to you &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; thank you very much. I hope I do this right. Listen to a story about man named brad and bout a house and it's bad.

A busy week for earnings will include results from America`s biggest banks and tech companies. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies on the central bank`s monetary policy, in a semi-annual appearance before the Senate and House. </p><p>Yellen is expected to hew closely to the Fed`s last policy statement. Investors will parse her comments closely for any signs that data released since the Fed`s last meeting has shifted the central bank`s thinking at all. The remarks, mandated by the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978, have Yellen speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and a House panel on Wednesday. The commerce department also releases the data for retail sales for June, expecting 0.6 percent of raise and the department issues business inventories for May on the same day. The commerce department is scheduled to issue housing starts for June on Thursday, while the labor department is expected to issue weekly Jobless Claims. From Google and Yahoo to General Electric, next week will bring a full range of corporate results as the earning season shifts into high gear. Earnings from some of the biggest U.S. technology companies will take center stage next week, giving investors a chance to re-evaluate the sector`s health. Big tech names set to report next week include Intel Corp and Yahoo Inc on Tuesday; eBay Inc on Wednesday and Google Inc on Thursday.<br/><br/>The tech sector has the highest projected earnings growth rate among the 10 S&amp;P sectors for the second quarter at 12.3 percent, its best quarter since the first quarter of 2012. This forecast marks a sharp rebound from a drop of 3.2 percent just a year ago, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.<br/><br/>Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note that the information technology sector \"appears to be the most undervalued sector,\" giving investors more reasons to be bullish on tech stocks.<br/><br/>The implied earnings-per-share growth for the tech sector has been 5.4 percentage points above the S&amp;P 500 on average over the past 10 years, but it is now just 1.0 percentage point above the benchmark index, according to the Goldman Sachs note. Earnings from some of major banks next week will include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday, Bank of America Corp on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday. Analysts are expecting subdued results because a slowdown in revenue from mortgage refinancing and trading is offsetting gains from other areas like investment banking and money management. Higher legal, regulatory and compliance costs are also weighing on results. Wells Fargo`s report on Friday underscored some of the problems as the largest U.S. mortgage lender reported a 39 percent decline in revenue from that business. BlackRock, the world`s largest money manager, is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday morning before market open. Analysts expect the New York-based asset manager, which now manages more than $4.4 trillion in<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.icn.com/wiki/EnglishICN.Assets.ashx\">assets,</url>to earn $4.41 per share, up from $4.15 per share a year ago. eBay, which is expected to report a 68 cents per share profit on Wednesday, also saw its traffic fall after Google updated its search engine, analysts said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1093881233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CNG-CW51-F04Y-T2GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 13, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

Google representatives were invited, but didn't show. The upshot is that it seems more likely than ever that some form of legislation or regulation for social media and online platforms is on the way - on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Let's start with the letter from the UK broadcasters and telcos. It's central point was that they invest in the UK economy and infrastructure, pay taxes and are regulated by Ofcom. This is in contrast to the giants of Silicon Valley, which lawfully avoid UK taxes and are almost entirely unregulated.</p><p>\"There is an urgent need for independent scrutiny of the decisions taken, and greater transparency,\" the letter says. \"This is not about censoring the internet, it is about making the most popular internet platforms safer, by ensuring there is accountability and transparency over the decisions these private companies are already taking.\"</p><p>They've got a point. While traditional media companies are subject to regulation, the tech bros are free to do what they want. This means inconsistent policies around hate-speech, promises that artificial intelligence will solve all problems, and denials that online platforms have the legal or social responsibilities of a media company. They aren't beholden to anyone other than their shareholders and their customers.</p><p>In effect this means a coven of bright but idealistic young men who live in Silicon Valley and have drunk the tech utopia Kool Aid are self-regulating the platforms they created, which have grown to have global influence. The reason they've gotten this far without regulation is the dominance of big tech's PR and lobbying machine, and the digital ignorance of legislators across the globe. But that's changing. The UK government has promised a white paper on internet safety that will propose policies to \"ensure Britain is the safest place in the world to be online\" - hence the public lobbying from traditional media players for some form of regulation of social platforms. Europe's GDPR and upcoming ePrivacy Directive place the digital consumer in the driving seat around how their online personal information is used and by whom.</p><p>In Germany, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz law (don't you just love German legislation titles) enacted in January ensures that social networks with more than two million users have 24 hours to delete posts that contain Nazi symbolism, Holocaust denial and hate speech. If they don't they can be fined up to (EURO)50m.</p><p>But it's in the US - the home of Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon - where things really need to change. Claims that social media platforms are biased against right-wing media overshadowed everything else at this week's hearings, but regulation was pretty prominent subplot. \"Congress is going to have to take action here,\" said the democratic Senator Mark Warner (inset). \"The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end.\"</p><p>The tech companies do seem to realise that regulation is inevitable. \"I do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,\" Twitter's Dorsey said. \"People do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.\"</p><p>But the platforms still want to regulate themselves. Mind you, some have stated their support for the Honest Ads Act, which would require companies to disclose how political advertisements are targeted and how much is spent on them.</p><p>But, to date, there's been no mention of any changes to the 1996 Communications Decency Act that states interactive media services aren't publishers, and aren't liable for any offending material uploaded, provided they take some action to take it down. The US holds a prominent position in relation to how these new global platforms are regulated.</p><p>Sure, some regulator for social media that reports to Ofcom in the UK is needed - but until US legislators make the big tech platforms liable for defamation or copyright infringements, tackle misinformation or follow the lead of the EU with its GDPR, it'll take more than a strongly worded letter to change things for the better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

They promise action in the coming year on a host of issues: competition, online privacy, encryption and bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon are girding themselves for more federal scrutiny.</p><p>\"As the internet companies matured without a lot of regulation, some issues have emerged where attention is needed,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat representing Silicon Valley since 1994 and who has introduced a national online privacy bill.</p><p>\"I think it's fair enough to examine what kind of rules should be set in certain elements of the tech economy,\" she said.</p><p>For years, Washington was enamored with the technology industry and its iconic companies that fueled economic growth. They created new tools for campaigning and reaching voters, and enjoyed an aura of cool.</p><p>Online privacy and user data</p><p>Now, there are threats of fines over things such as violating users' privacy or stifling competition.</p><p>In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission issued a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for \"deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information.\" It also issued a $170 million fine against Google for violating children's privacy on YouTube, which Google owns.</p><p>New laws, such as the one Lofgren proposes, could give American users more control over their online data and limit companies' ability to collect user data. Those moves could limit companies' ability to sell advertising, which funds the free internet.</p><p>Antitrust and competition</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans criticize \"Big Tech,\" as it is now called. And in the coming year, the pressure will likely increase.</p><p>\"Whenever the word 'Big' is placed before your industry, it's not a good thing,\" said Carl Guardino, president and chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents many of the region's tech firms. \"It's now 'Big Tech,' and you know it's not used as a term of endearment.\"</p><p>Foreign users of American tech products could also see changes if Washington follows through on threats to break up large companies like Facebook. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is reportedly drafting a bill (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/07/warrens-antitrust-bill-would-boost-government-control-over-biggest-companies.html)to\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/07/warrens-antitrust-bill-would-boost-government-control-over-biggest-companies.html)to</url> toughen the country's rules about antitrust and competition.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly looking into stopping Facebook's further integration of Whatsapp and Instagram (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055</url>), in case it would one day see a need to break up the social network giant.</p><p>Washington seems to have woken up to the dangers of technology companies that have become the gatekeepers of communications and commerce, said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, a research group that focuses on antitrust issues.</p><p>\"The traction has definitely really intensified over the last year,\" she said. \"There's also just a growing awareness that these companies are causing a wide range of harms, whether it's harms to our democracy, harms to innovation, harms to entrepreneurship.

Perhaps, some suggested, Big Tech is becoming less concentrated if one considers digital services industries such as computer systems design, which our definition of the \u201cinnovation sector\u201d omitted. Those industries could be more footloose and likely to stray from large coastal cities and into the heartland.</p><p>Unfortunately, thenew analysis we produced for the American Enterprise Institute on the geography of digital services industries doesn\u2019t show this. In fact, it shows the opposite: more divergence between the metropolitan \u201cwinners\u201d and also-rans. Tech\u2014as epitomized by the four key digital services industries we studied\u2014is concentrating rather than spreading out.</p><p>Sure, dozens of snappy startups are launching in places like Akron, Ohio, Memphis, Tenn., and Louisville, Ky.\u2014enough so that metro areas across America have added tech jobs since 2010. But even so, digital tech by our measure has continued to concentrate in a short list of major cities over the decade, rather than disperse outwards. As such, many metro areas are losing their shares of the overall tech sector even as they grow.</p><p>The upshot is sobering: \u201cWinner-take-most\u201d seems more the rule than the hoped-for\u201crise of the rest.\u201d And that\u2019s a problem we will need to confront more directly than we have until now.</p><p>What specifically does the new data show? The story isn\u2019t great. Expanding on our last look at tech location trends from late 2018, this new analysis of job creation in four digital services industries finds that superficial good news masks deeper-set problems.</p><p>To be clear, tech remains a compelling contributor to regional growth, and is, in fact, growing in new places. Specifically, digital services continues as a critical part of the national economy, accounting for 80% of the nation\u2019s advanced industries growth from 2010 to 2018, as employment grew 4.2% a year based on compound annual growth rate (CAGR) calculations. Likewise, unexpected heartland metro areas far from the coastal hubs surfaced as fast-growing tech centers in the 2010s. Among the 100 largest U.S metro areas, for example, Charleston, S.C , Charlotte, N.C , Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla., Boise, Idaho, and Wichita, Kan. all posted digital services growth of over 7% per year over the decade. Midwestern stalwarts Kansas City, Mo., Madison, Wis., and Indianapolis all saw yearly growth of more than 6%.</p><p>In short, it\u2019s absolutely true that tens of thousands of digital services jobs\u2014central to the current artificial intelligence-driven tech boom\u2014are sprouting in up-and-coming heartland towns. And with those jobs comes growth, hope, good pay, and attractive economic multiplier effects.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>But that\u2019s just the surface story. Deeper analysis of tech\u2019s shifting structure clearly shows that although more cities are enjoying a mathematical rise in the number of tech jobs, the sector has been rapidly concentrating all decade. This dynamic may reflect the rising importance of giant agglomerations of talent and firms in periods of tech disruption, as with the decade\u2019s waves of social media and artificial intelligence innovation. It might reflect the continued groupthink of tech industry managers and funders about siting decisions. Or, it might reflect the geographic effect ofmonopolistic \u201cplatforms\u201d in Big Tech, which may prevent the entry of geographical as well as corporate rivals.</p><p>The numbers are eye-popping. The top five metro areas with the highest shares of the nation\u2019s digital services industry accounted for 28% of all of these jobs nationwide in 2018, while the top 10 encompassed 44.3%. The same top 10 metro areas captured almost half (47.9%) of the nation\u2019s new tech jobs from 2010 to 2018, with five of them\u2014San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas\u2014increasing their share of the nation\u2019s tech work especially fast. Those five alone captured 28% of all new digital services job growth and increased their share of the nation\u2019s core tech employment by 1.8 percentage points.\u200b</p><p>Table 2</p><p>To put a finer point on the trend, consider that tech\u2019s most elite \u201csuperstar\u201d cities\u2014San Francisco and San Jose\u2014ascended even further in the 2010s. San Francisco added over 10% of the nation\u2019s new digital services jobs (roughly 110,000), while San Jose accounted for nearly 8% of such jobs, or about 83,000. Together, the two hubs have added 200,000 digital services jobs since 2010 and now concentrate some 11% of the nation\u2019s digital services employment, up from 10.1% in 2015 and 7.5% in 2010. The two also captured a whopping 17.7% of the decade\u2019s new tech employment, and today house nearly 350,000 of the nation\u2019s 3.1 million total tech jobs</p><p>Meanwhile, only a few cities in the rest of the country have truly \u201crisen\u201d in the last couple of years and expanded their share of the nation\u2019s digital services employment. Just seven of the largest 100 metro areas in the nation increased their share of the sector by more than two-tenths of a percentage point. In the heartland, only Charlotte, N.C , Denver, and Phoenix are among them. Only nine additional metro areas in the largest 100\u2014including inland centers such as Dallas, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., and Provo, Utah\u2014managed to increase their share of the nation\u2019s digital services sector by at least one-tenth of a percentage point.\u200b</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Otherwise, progress toward a more geographically balanced tech sector was modest to vanishingly slight in the last decade. Just 21 cities saw their sector share increase between 2010 and 2018, albeit via gains of less than one-tenth of a percent. This group was led by Raleigh, N.C and includes a number of up-and-coming interior Midwestern and Southern cities such as Pittsburgh, Akron, Greenville, S.C , Grand Rapids, Mich., Chattanooga, Tenn., Spokane, Wash., and Salt Lake City. Although many of these cities made steady progress, they are not significantly increasing their share of the national digital services sector or demonstrating compelling competitiveness.</p><p>As for the rest of the nation\u2019s 100 larger metro regions, no less than 63 saw their share of the sector decline due to slow or negative growth. Metro areas such as Providence, R.I , Little Rock, Ark., Virginia Beach, Va., and Stockton, Calif. lost 5% or more of their digital services employment between 2010 and 2018.</p><p>The verdict of the data is sobering, then: While tech\u2019s superstar cities have captured the lion\u2019s share of job creation in digital services, their immoderate success has not triggered any sort of self-regulating equilibrium process by which the nation\u2019s stark geographic divides might begin to ease. Even as the tech sector continues to raise hopes for broad economic transformation in the nation\u2019s interior, it is continuing to reflect\u2014and drive\u2014a \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d result. At a time when the nation badly needs to reconnect left-behind people and places to prosperity, tech\u2019s inherent tendency to facilitate geographic agglomeration is only sharpening the nation\u2019s divides.</p><p>So, what is it going to take to moderate this tendency and perhaps to spur tech sector growth in new places? Having tracked these trends through the decade, I think the case for concerted national action is now clear, as Atkinson and I previously argued.</p><p>The tech economy is unleashing forces that benefit only select group of elite regions, often to the detriment of everyone else. These dynamics are circular, cumulative, and massively scaled. Therefore, they call for a nation-scaled response.</p><p>What might such a response look like? At least one part needs to be a national innovation response, one that fundamentally intervenes to alter the country\u2019s entrenched tech map. This is the intent of our proposal for a major tech innovation \u201csurge\u201d that would counter regional divergence by mounting a national competition to create eight to 10 new innovation-driven \u201cgrowth centers\u201d across the heartland. The plan would be to focus transformative R&amp;D, workforce inclusion, and \u201cplacemaking\u201d investment on a limited number of locations as part of a deliberate effort to catalyze the innovation sector takeoff of those regions and develop new tech centers in new places. The same type of federal, place-based innovation surge that created Silicon Valley less intentionally could be updated to do the same for America\u2019s left-behind regions.</p><p>But this is just one idea; others can certainly be imagined. We likely need a strategy for reinvigorating hundreds of solid but stagnant communities that lack a plausible innovation \u201cplay\u201d of the sort that the growth centers proposal seeks to catalyze. And we need some kind of response to the crisis of the truly left-behind places: the deeply distressed smaller towns and rural areas that have lost their economic purpose and are now stuck in corrosive traps of nonparticipation and underdevelopment.</p><p>What is increasingly clear, though, is that tech-based growth will likely not diffuse out into America\u2019s up-and-coming midsized cities and small towns on its own. Instead, it\u2019s going to take tougher action from a concerned nation to counter this excessive concentration and spark new vitality across the heartland.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3052074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-6D71-F0YC-N0FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The commission has faced a 1-1 deadlock since January under Republican acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen and Democratic Commissioner Terrell McSweeny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The leadership shift from Ohlhausen to Simons won't mean a move away from the policy stances Ohlhausen put in place when her chairmanship began in January. There are questions about how renewed skepticism within the federal government toward tech companies will manifest with a full FTC complement, lobbyists said.</p><p>Trump plans to nominate Simons, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Assistant Director Rohit Chopra; and Noah Phillips, chief counsel to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas; a White House spokeswoman said. The White House formally announced Trump's intent to nominate Chopra and Simons Thursday. A formal announcement on Phillips is pending but \u0192_oI am not aware of the timing,\u0192__ the spokeswoman said. Simons was an FTC antitrust official during President George W. Bush's administration. Phillips was formerly a lawyer with Steptoe &amp; Johnson and Cravath Swaine. Chopra is now a Consumer Federation of America senior fellow.</p><p>Senate Commerce Committee members' reactions were generally restrained before a formal nomination of the trio. Trump's selections are \u0192_owhat we expected,\u0192__ said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D. \u0192_oWe'll do our best to process them\" because \"those are positions that need to be filled.\u0192__ Senate Commerce consideration of the nominees will depend on the timing of nominations being sent to the Senate and their completion of required paperwork, a committee spokesman said.</p><p>Senate Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson, D-Fla., declined to comment on the nominees pending further review. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told us she looks \u0192_oforward to meeting\u0192__ Simons. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., recommended Chopra, an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to fill the vacant Democratic seat (see 1705090048). Chopra \u0192_ohas dedicated his career to advocating on behalf of average American consumers, not the wealthy and powerful,\u0192__ Schumer said in a statement.</p><p>House Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., and House Digital Commerce Subcommittee Chairman Bob Latta, R-Ohio, said Simons' nomination means \u0192_owe are closer to a full complement of leadership at the commission.\u0192__ Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called Simons a \u0192_osteady hand that the moment requires, and that the market, the bar, and consumers expect.\u0192__ Chopra \u0192_ois widely regarded as a leading expert in the protection of consumers and the fairness of our markets,\u0192__ Hatch said. \u0192_oThis is a bipartisan package that every Senator should be eager to support.\u0192__</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioner Mike O'Rielly both tweeted in praise of Simons' nomination to lead the FTC. O'Rielly also called Phillips a \u0192_owonderful choice.\"</p><p>Policy Implications</p><p>Nothing is immediately obvious in the nominees' backgrounds that would indicate anything other than an easy Senate confirmation vote, though the process could kick up further debate on a range of tech sector-related policy issues on which both parties have become more vocal over the past year, several industry lobbyists and officials said. Some lobbyists cited recent calls for the FTC to reopen the antitrust investigation into Google that it closed in 2013 amid progress with EU's ongoing work. Others noted criticisms of the FTC's quick approval earlier this year of Amazon's buy of Whole Foods and the debate over amending Communications Decency Act Section 230 to combat online sex trafficking.</p><p>Consideration of Simons could spark a battle similar to what recently confirmed DOJ Antitrust Division head Makan Delrahim faced earlier this year \u0192_osince there is an expectation among some that the FTC should investigate big tech companies,\u0192__ said cybersecurity consulting firm Providence Group Chairman Dan Caprio, who has known Simons for many years.</p><p>The tech sector is facing \u0192_orange of issues\u0192__ on Capitol Hill now, including legislation filed Thursday by Klobuchar and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., to regulate online political ads (see 1710180027 and 1710190054), a tech sector lobbyist said. \u0192_oBut I think one of the good things about an independent regulatory agency is that they can focus on the facts in front of them\u0192__ rather than bow to political pressure. A full, majority-GOP FTC could be a positive for the tech sector if it continues to follow the \u0192_ospecific harms\u0192__ doctrine that Ohlhausen favored, the lobbyist said.</p><p>The FTC's role will become \"more important than ever\" if the FCC rescinds its 2015 reclassification of broadband as a Communications Act Title II service, said Free State Foundation President Randolph May. A telecom lobbyist pointed to the likely looming debate within the FTC over how to grapple with a regulatory gap on broadband if the FCC rescinds 2015 net neutrality rules and Title II reclassification of broadband. A three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled last year that the common-carrier exemption means the FTC can't regulate telecom companies. The court reheard the case en banc in September (see 1608290032, 1611020031 and 1709190025).</p><p>Status Quo?</p><p>It's unlikely a Simons' takeover would shift policy priorities already favored under Ohlhausen, Caprio and others said.</p><p>There would be a \u0192_oseamless and orderly\u0192__ transition, Caprio said. Former FTC attorney Julie O\u0192_TNeill, now a Morrison Foerster lawyer, doesn\u0192_Tt know Simons but anticipates the commission probably will look the same as now. Ohlhausen \u0192_ohas stressed the need to focus resources on where there is actual harm, and I would expect any other Republican chair to take a similar, somewhat business-friendly, position,\u0192__ she said.</p><p>Ohlhausen \"would have made an excellent permanent chairman,\" May said. It's unclear whether Ohlhausen herself will remain on the commission if the Senate confirms Simons, lobbyists said. An FTC spokesman didn't comment. \u0192_oI am honored that the President asked me to serve as the Acting Chairman of the FTC, which has allowed me to lay the groundwork for the Commission\u0192_Ts efforts to protect economic liberty, support small businesses and military consumers, fight fraud, promote vigorous competition, and refocus agency enforcement where it best serves the public,\u0192__ Ohlhausen said. Her term as commissioner ends in September 2018. McSweeny's term expired in September.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PRX-9MJ1-DYRJ-03TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 20, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00029O6</classCode><className>CRAVATH SWAINE &amp;

It is your introduction to who you are.\"</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at McGill's Max Bell School of Public Policy and author of Disruptive Power: The Crisis of the State in the Digital Age, says the Liberal government's \"change in positioning\" over the last four years has been dramatic.</p><p>\"The issue has evolved, they now know a lot more and there is more awareness about how the platforms function and they are realizing that a laissez-faire approach to governing does not work in a democratic world,\" said Owen.</p><p>As minister responsible for the communications file, the 52-year-old Rodriguez says it is not just scripted content he is concerned about. The lack of local news is a problem.</p><p>\"Journalists play a fundamental role in our society,\" he says. \"We need to protect what that stands for in terms of democracy.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says recent European copyright legislation that has placed stringent rules on digital platforms seems like a positive step toward figuring out a complex issue.</p><p>\"They have been working on that for a long time. For them, it's the end of a marathon. We are just starting our sprint. But we are moving as fast as we can.\"</p><p>He says his department is looking at issues such as discoverability and more transparency for the algorithms that determine what music, film, television and published works appear at the top of search fields.</p><p>\"Discoverability is key. I don't want my daughter watching TV or listening to music or reading a book and everything that's suggested to her is American,\" he says. \"In the old days, you burn a CD then you sell it through a record store. Today, to make money, someone has to find it if it pops up on your search. That's a huge difference.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't sure what tools Canada will eventually use to ensure that local news stays healthy.</p><p>\"There are a number of things we can do, but I will wait for the recommendations.\"</p><p>Culture, Rodriguez says, is that invisible bond that holds Canadians together. And perhaps something we take too much for granted.</p><p>\"You have to understand. When we got here (in the 1970s) we barely survived a bomb attack on our home. Many people we knew over the years were killed,\" says Rodriguez. \"But culture through playing Canadian music on the guitar, to learning language on television, kept me going.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRMTR-2019090355507426</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRMTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYY-BCV1-F103-34D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464619</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Star Metroland Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>StarMetro Calgary</publicationName><edition>StarMetro Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

He arrived in Montreal at the age of 8 speaking only Spanish, but eventually learning French and English.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the former political refugee finds himself, perhaps a little improbably, as the guardian of Canadian culture.</p><p>\"That's so Canadian, right?\" says an animated Rodriguez, who has been the heritage minister for just over a year, in an exclusive interview with the Star.</p><p>Learning Canada's languages as a child through film, television and books, Rodriguez says he became a passionate defender of the culture he was immersed in. But the landscape is changing. Big digital platforms are transforming the way Canadians consume their culture.</p><p>So, he says emphatically, sitting at a table in the lobby of Toronto's busy Fairmont Royal York Hotel, there will be \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms and their contributions to Canadian culture.</p><p>\"Anyone who benefits should contribute, and that includes the big internet players. It's only fair,\" says Rodriguez. \"There are so many players in the industry, but they should all be treated equally if we are to maintain our culture.\"</p><p>Rodriguez is giving the clearest statement of intent yet by the Liberal government about where they are headed on legislation in regard to the culture industry in the digital era.</p><p>\"We intend to create a level playing field. The structure and foundations of what we are used to has changed so fast that we need to address how we will deal with this so Canadians benefit.\"</p><p>It's been a contentious issue that has an impact on all Canadians. Digital platforms such as Netlfix and Amazon and the soon to be launched Disney Plus streaming service are carving away audiences from Canadian broadcasters. Unlike domestic cable operators, they are not required to fund and produce original Canadian content - shows that tell Canadian stories to Canadians and are also exported to the world.</p><p>Rodriguez's fighting words seem to be setting his department up on a collision course with Big Tech.</p><p>At the request of Rodriguez, as well as Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, there is currently a legislative review panel looking at how to update the Broadcasting Act for the disruptive digital age. But that report won't be available until January, well after the upcoming October federal election.</p><p>So the jury isn't out just yet. But is the minister effectively gaming the system with his comments?</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't \"telling the committee how to do their job. That's up to them to draw their own conclusions.\" However, when asked if panel chair Janet Yale should hypothetically come up with a recommendation that says foreign digital platforms don't have to contribute after all, Rodriguez says, \"We will certainly take into consideration her recommendations. But the government will make their own decisions at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Rodriguez's words are also a dramatic shift from his predecessor M\u00e9lanie Joly, who was heavily criticized for making a $500 million, five-year development deal with Netflix to produce content. Critics say the Los Angeles-based streamer would have likely spent that anyway and what was needed were regulations to force foreign platforms to put a percentage of revenue into original productions.</p><p>Netflix doesn't agree. \"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says.</p><p>With a tight race expected in the upcoming election, this may be a moot point. There is a solid chance Rodriguez may no longer wield influence this time next year.</p><p>But he says he is aware of the urgency to update laws created before the digital age. Local news has been decimated. And domestic broadcasters say they can't compete with deep-pocketed streamers who don't have the same requirements and regulations to pay into funds that support Canadian culture.</p><p>\"We say our culture is important. I think most people would say that we have to give our creators and artists the means to succeed and that requires participation from everybody.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he is passionate about the subject because he came to understand the need to have a vibrant culture from a young age.</p><p>\"Listening to the music, watching television, it immersed me in the culture and made me understand where I was and who I was as a Canadian,\" says Rodriguez.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRMTR-2019090355507421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRMTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYY-BCV1-F103-34D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464619</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Star Metroland Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>StarMetro Halifax</publicationName><edition>StarMetro Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

I think most people would say that we have to give our creators and artists the means to succeed and that requires participation from everybody.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he is passionate about the subject because he came to understand the need to have a vibrant culture from a young age.</p><p>Rodriguez learned French from reading books, listening to music and watching television. As a child, he watched Quebec's popular Bobino puppet show to pick up the language.</p><p>Now, he oversees a department created through the amalgamation of the minister of communications and minister of multiculturalism and citizenship posts in 1996.</p><p>As an adult, his tastes veer toward historical drama. He recently binge-watched the French-language version of History TV's Vikings, a Canadian-produced show starring Etobicoke actor Kathryn Winnick, which he declares is \"fantastic.\"</p><p>\"Listening to the music, watching television, it immersed me in the culture and made me understand where I was and who I was as a Canadian,\" Rodriguez said. \"That's why culture is so important, and that's why we must cherish it. It is your introduction to who you are.\"</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at McGill's Max Bell School of Public Policy and author of Disruptive Power: The Crisis of the State in the Digital Age,says the Liberal government's \"change in positioning\" over the last four years has been dramatic.</p><p>\"The issue has evolved, they now know a lot more and there is more awareness about how the platforms function and they are realizing that a laissez faire approach to governing does not work in a democratic world,\" Owen said.</p><p>As minister responsible for the communications file, the 52-year-old Rodriguez says it is not just scripted content he is concerned about. The lack of local news is a problem.</p><p>\"Journalists play a fundamental role in our society,\" he said. \"We need to protect what that stands for in terms of democracy.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says recent European copyright legislation that has placed stringent rules on digital platforms seems like a positive step toward figuring out a complex issue.</p><p>\"They have been working on that for a long time. For them, it's the end of a marathon. We are just starting our sprint. But we are moving as fast as we can.\"</p><p>He says his department is looking at issues such as discoverability and more transparency for the algorithms that determine what music, film, television and published works appear at the top of search fields.</p><p>\"Discoverability is key. I don't want my daughter watching TV or listening to music or reading a book and everything that's suggested to her is American,\" he said. \"In the old days, you burn a CD, then you sell it through a record store. Today, to make money, someone has to find it if it pops up on your search. That's a huge difference.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't sure what tools Canada will eventually use to ensure that local news stays healthy.</p><p>\"There are a number of things we can do, but I will wait for the recommendations.\"</p><p>Canadian publishers have lobbied for a \"link tax\" similar to legislation implemented by the European Union that would allow publishers to share in the proceeds from search engines readers click on.</p><p>And there is the issue of advertising deductibility, where Canadian advertisers are not allowed to deduct advertising costs from print editions of foreign publications, but they can do so in digital publications - a clear example of a regulation made in the print era that has created an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"Those are some of the things we are looking at, certainly,\" Rodriguez said. \"But we don't have any specific direction at the moment. We know the urgency and are working on everything that relates to this.\"</p><p>So far, Rodriguez has supported the news industry with a controversial $650-million, five-year tax credit. The tax credit was pointed out as a potential way to support the Australian news industry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry looking at regulating digital platforms.</p><p>In Canada, critics including the Conservative party and some journalists have said the move is tantamount to the Trudeau government buying off the media in an election year.</p><p>\"The government shouldn't choose who gets extra money to cover its re-election campaign,\" Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said.</p><p>Rodriguez argues it has nothing to do with elections, but whether legacy media will continue to thrive.</p><p>\"I think we're lucky to have the kind of professional journalism we do in this country and we should support it,\" he said.</p><p>At just over a year on the job, the Member of Parliament for Honor\u00e9-Mercier and former vice-president of non-profit aid group Oxfam Quebec has been busy.</p><p>His department has been working on projects including $45 million for an anti-racism strategy, cultural infrastructure projects including $8.3 million for Toronto's Massey Hall and $6 million for the Evergreen Brick Works, and $50 million in funding for festivals.</p><p>\"Why festivals? Because they gather people. It's about your friend, your family, your neighbour. It plays a social role that is also important. This is also culture.\"</p><p>Culture, he says, is that invisible bond that holds Canadians together. And perhaps something we take too much for granted.</p><p>\"You have to understand. When we got here (in the 1970s), we barely survived a bomb attack on our home. Many people we knew over the years were killed,\" Rodriguez said. \"But culture through playing Canadian music on the guitar, to learning language on television, kept me going.\"</p><p>His father told Rodriguez that Canada was the land of opportunity. But please, don't get into politics. The family had had enough.</p><p>\"I think he was just being protective. But it's in the blood. Politics is the best way to change the world. And culture is the best way for Canadians to see and appreciate their world.

He arrived in Montreal at the age of 8 speaking only Spanish, but eventually learning French and English.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the former political refugee finds himself, perhaps a little improbably, as the guardian of Canadian culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That's so Canadian, right?\" says an animated Rodriguez, who has been the Heritage Minister for just over a year, in an exclusive interview with the Star.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Learning Canada's languages as a child through film, television and books, Rodriguez says he became a passionate defender of the culture he was immersed in. But the landscape is changing. Big digital platforms are transforming the way Canadians consume their culture.</p><p>So, he says emphatically, sitting at a table in the lobby of Toronto's busy Fairmont Royal York Hotel, there will be \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms and their contributions to Canadian culture.</p><p>\"Anyone who benefits should contribute, and that includes the big internet players. It's only fair,\" says Rodriguez. \"There are so many players in the industry, but they should all be treated equally if we are to maintain our culture.\"</p><p>Rodriguez is giving the clearest statement of intent yet by the Liberal government about where they are headed on legislation in regard to the culture industry in the digital era.</p><p>\"We intend to create a level playing field. The structure and foundations of what we are used to has changed so fast that we need to address how we will deal with this so Canadians benefit.\"</p><p>It's been a contentious issue that has an impact on all Canadians. Digital platforms such as Netlfix and Amazon and the soon to be launched Disney Plus streaming service are carving away audiences from Canadian broadcasters. Unlike domestic cable operators, they are not required to fund and produce original Canadian content - shows that tell Canadian stories to Canadians and are also exported to the world.</p><p>Rodriguez's fighting words seem to be setting his department up on a collision course with Big Tech.</p><p>At the request of Rodriguez, as well as Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, there is currently a legislative review panel looking at how to update the Broadcasting Act for the disruptive digital age. But that report won't be available until January, well after the upcoming October federal election.</p><p>So the jury isn't out just yet. But is the minister effectively gaming the system with his comments?</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't \"telling the committee how to do their job. That's up to them to draw their own conclusions.\" However, when asked if panel chair Janet Yale should hypothetically come up with a recommendation that says foreign digital platforms don't have to contribute after all, Rodriguez says, \"We will certainly take into consideration her recommendations. But the government will make their own decisions at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Rodriguez's words are also a dramatic shift from his predecessor M&amp;#233;lanie Joly, who was heavily criticized for making a $500 million, five-year development deal with Netflix to produce content. Critics say the Los Angeles-based streamer would have likely spent that anyway and what was needed were regulations to force foreign platforms to put a percentage of revenue into original productions.</p><p>Netflix doesn't agree. \"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says.</p><p>With a tight race expected in the upcoming election, this may be a moot point. There is a solid chance Rodriguez may no longer wield influence this time next year.</p><p>But he says he is aware of the urgency to update laws created before the digital age. Local news has been decimated. And domestic broadcasters say they can't compete with deep-pocketed streamers who don't have the same requirements and regulations to pay into funds that support Canadian culture.</p><p>\"We say our culture is important. I think most people would say that we have to give our creators and artists the means to succeed and that requires participation from everybody.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he is passionate about the subject because he came to understand the need to have a vibrant culture from a young age.</p><p>Rodriguez learned French from reading books, listening to music and watching television. As a child, he watched Quebec's popular Bobino puppet show to pick up the language.</p><p>Now he oversees a department created through the amalgamation of the Minister of Communications and Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship posts in 1996.</p><p>As an adult, his tastes veer toward historical drama. He recently binge-watched the French-language version of History TV's Vikings, a Canadian-produced show starring Etobicoke actor Kathryn Winnick, which he declares is \"fantastic.\"</p><p>\"Listening to the music, watching television, it immersed me in the culture and made me understand where I was and who I was as a Canadian,\" says Rodriguez. \"That's why culture is so important, and that's why we must cherish it. It is your introduction to who you are.\"</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at McGill's Max Bell School of Public Policy and author of Disruptive Power: The Crisis of the State in the Digital Age, says the Liberal government's \"change in positioning\" over the last four years has been dramatic.</p><p>\"The issue has evolved, they now know a lot more and there is more awareness about how the platforms function and they are realizing that a laissez faire approach to governing does not work in a democratic world,\" said Owen.</p><p>As minister responsible for the communications file, the 52-year-old Rodriguez says it is not just scripted content he is concerned about. The lack of local news is a problem.</p><p>\"Journalists play a fundamental role in our society,\" he says. \"We need to protect what that stands for in terms of democracy.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says recent European copyright legislation that has placed stringent rules on digital platforms seems like a positive step toward figuring out a complex issue.</p><p>\"They have been working on that for a long time. For them, it's the end of a marathon. We are just starting our sprint. But we are moving as fast as we can.\"</p><p>He says his department is looking at issues such as discoverability and more transparency for the algorithms that determine what music, film, television and published works appear at the top of search fields.</p><p>\"Discoverability is key. I don't want my daughter watching TV or listening to music or reading a book and everything that's suggested to her is American,\" he says. \"In the old days, you burn a CD then you sell it through a record store. Today, to make money, someone has to find it if it pops up on your search. That's a huge difference.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't sure what tools Canada will eventually use to ensure that local news stays healthy.</p><p>\"There are a number of things we can do, but I will wait for the recommendations.\"</p><p>Canadian publishers have lobbied for a \"link tax\" similar to legislation implemented by the European Union that would allow publishers to share in the proceeds from search engines readers click on.</p><p>And there is the issue of advertising deductibility, where Canadian advertisers are not allowed to deduct advertising costs from print editions of foreign publications, but they can do so in digital publications - a clear example of a regulation made in the print era that has created an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"Those are some of the things we are looking at, certainly,\" says Rodriguez. \"But we don't have any specific direction at the moment. We know the urgency and are working on everything that relates to this.\"</p><p>So far, Rodriguez has supported the news industry with a controversial $650 million, five-year tax credit. The tax credit was pointed out as a potential way to support the Australian news industry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry looking at regulating digital platforms.</p><p>In Canada, critics including the Conservative party and some journalists, have said the move is tantamount to the Trudeau government buying off the media in an election year.</p><p>\"The government shouldn't choose who gets extra money to cover its re-election campaign,\" said Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.</p><p>Rodriguez argues it has nothing to do with elections, but whether legacy media will continue to thrive.</p><p>\"I think we're lucky to have the kind of professional journalism we do in this country and we should support it,\" he says</p><p>At just over a year on the job, the Member of Parliament for Honor&amp;#233;-Mercier and former vice-president of non-profit aid group Oxfam Quebec has been busy. His department has been working on projects including $45 million for an anti-racism strategy, cultural infrastructure projects including $8.3 million for Toronto's Massey Hall and $6 million for the Evergreen Brick Works, and $50 million in funding for festivals.</p><p>\"Why festivals? Because they gather people. It's about your friend, your family, your neighbour. It plays a social role that is also important. This is also culture.\"</p><p>Culture, he says, is that invisible bond that holds Canadians together. And perhaps something we take too much for granted.</p><p>\"You have to understand. When we got here (in the 1970s) we barely survived a bomb attack on our home. Many people we knew over the years were killed,\" says Rodriguez. \"But culture through playing Canadian music on the guitar, to learning language on television, kept me going.\"</p><p>His father told Rodriguez Canada was the land of opportunity. But please, don't get into politics. The family had had enough.</p><p>\"I think he was just being protective. But it's in the blood. Politics is the best way to change the world. And culture is the best way for Canadians to see and appreciate their world. And that's why I've always felt that it's important that everyone contribute.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

He arrived in Montreal at the age of 8 speaking only Spanish, but eventually learning French and English.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the former political refugee finds himself, perhaps a little improbably, as the guardian of Canadian culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That's so Canadian, right?\" says an animated Rodriguez, who has been the Heritage Minister for just over a year, in an exclusive interview with the Star.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Learning Canada's languages as a child through film, television and books, Rodriguez says he became a passionate defender of the culture he was immersed in. But the landscape is changing. Big digital platforms are transforming the way Canadians consume their culture.</p><p>So, he says emphatically, sitting at a table in the lobby of Toronto's busy Fairmont Royal York Hotel, there will be \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms and their contributions to Canadian culture.</p><p>\"Anyone who benefits should contribute, and that includes the big internet players. It's only fair,\" says Rodriguez. \"There are so many players in the industry, but they should all be treated equally if we are to maintain our culture.\"</p><p>Rodriguez is giving the clearest statement of intent yet by the Liberal government about where they are headed on legislation in regard to the culture industry in the digital era.</p><p>\"We intend to create a level playing field. The structure and foundations of what we are used to has changed so fast that we need to address how we will deal with this so Canadians benefit.\"</p><p>It's been a contentious issue that has an impact on all Canadians. Digital platforms such as Netlfix and Amazon and the soon to be launched Disney Plus streaming service are carving away audiences from Canadian broadcasters. Unlike domestic cable operators, they are not required to fund and produce original Canadian content - shows that tell Canadian stories to Canadians and are also exported to the world.</p><p>Rodriguez's fighting words seem to be setting his department up on a collision course with Big Tech.</p><p>At the request of Rodriguez, as well as Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, there is currently a legislative review panel looking at how to update the Broadcasting Act for the disruptive digital age. But that report won't be available until January, well after the upcoming October federal election.</p><p>So the jury isn't out just yet. But is the minister effectively gaming the system with his comments?</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't \"telling the committee how to do their job. That's up to them to draw their own conclusions.\" However, when asked if panel chair Janet Yale should hypothetically come up with a recommendation that says foreign digital platforms don't have to contribute after all, Rodriguez says, \"We will certainly take into consideration her recommendations. But the government will make their own decisions at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Rodriguez's words are also a dramatic shift from his predecessor M&amp;#233;lanie Joly, who was heavily criticized for making a $500 million, five-year development deal with Netflix to produce content. Critics say the Los Angeles-based streamer would have likely spent that anyway and what was needed were regulations to force foreign platforms to put a percentage of revenue into original productions.</p><p>Netflix doesn't agree. \"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says.</p><p>With a tight race expected in the upcoming election, this may be a moot point. There is a solid chance Rodriguez may no longer wield influence this time next year.</p><p>But he says he is aware of the urgency to update laws created before the digital age. Local news has been decimated. And domestic broadcasters say they can't compete with deep-pocketed streamers who don't have the same requirements and regulations to pay into funds that support Canadian culture.</p><p>\"We say our culture is important. I think most people would say that we have to give our creators and artists the means to succeed and that requires participation from everybody.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he is passionate about the subject because he came to understand the need to have a vibrant culture from a young age.</p><p>Rodriguez learned French from reading books, listening to music and watching television. As a child, he watched Quebec's popular Bobino puppet show to pick up the language.</p><p>Now he oversees a department created through the amalgamation of the Minister of Communications and Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship posts in 1996.</p><p>As an adult, his tastes veer toward historical drama. He recently binge-watched the French-language version of History TV's Vikings, a Canadian-produced show starring Etobicoke actor Kathryn Winnick, which he declares is \"fantastic.\"</p><p>\"Listening to the music, watching television, it immersed me in the culture and made me understand where I was and who I was as a Canadian,\" says Rodriguez. \"That's why culture is so important, and that's why we must cherish it. It is your introduction to who you are.\"</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at McGill's Max Bell School of Public Policy and author of Disruptive Power: The Crisis of the State in the Digital Age, says the Liberal government's \"change in positioning\" over the last four years has been dramatic.</p><p>\"The issue has evolved, they now know a lot more and there is more awareness about how the platforms function and they are realizing that a laissez faire approach to governing does not work in a democratic world,\" said Owen.</p><p>As minister responsible for the communications file, the 52-year-old Rodriguez says it is not just scripted content he is concerned about. The lack of local news is a problem.</p><p>\"Journalists play a fundamental role in our society,\" he says. \"We need to protect what that stands for in terms of democracy.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says recent European copyright legislation that has placed stringent rules on digital platforms seems like a positive step toward figuring out a complex issue.</p><p>\"They have been working on that for a long time. For them, it's the end of a marathon. We are just starting our sprint. But we are moving as fast as we can.\"</p><p>He says his department is looking at issues such as discoverability and more transparency for the algorithms that determine what music, film, television and published works appear at the top of search fields.</p><p>\"Discoverability is key. I don't want my daughter watching TV or listening to music or reading a book and everything that's suggested to her is American,\" he says. \"In the old days, you burn a CD then you sell it through a record store. Today, to make money, someone has to find it if it pops up on your search. That's a huge difference.\"</p><p>Rodriguez says he isn't sure what tools Canada will eventually use to ensure that local news stays healthy.</p><p>\"There are a number of things we can do, but I will wait for the recommendations.\"</p><p>Canadian publishers have lobbied for a \"link tax\" similar to legislation implemented by the European Union that would allow publishers to share in the proceeds from search engines readers click on.</p><p>And there is the issue of advertising deductibility, where Canadian advertisers are not allowed to deduct advertising costs from print editions of foreign publications, but they can do so in digital publications - a clear example of a regulation made in the print era that has created an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"Those are some of the things we are looking at, certainly,\" says Rodriguez. \"But we don't have any specific direction at the moment. We know the urgency and are working on everything that relates to this.\"</p><p>So far, Rodriguez has supported the news industry with a controversial $650 million, five-year tax credit. The tax credit was pointed out as a potential way to support the Australian news industry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry looking at regulating digital platforms.</p><p>In Canada, critics including the Conservative party and some journalists, have said the move is tantamount to the Trudeau government buying off the media in an election year.</p><p>\"The government shouldn't choose who gets extra money to cover its re-election campaign,\" said Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.</p><p>Rodriguez argues it has nothing to do with elections, but whether legacy media will continue to thrive.</p><p>\"I think we're lucky to have the kind of professional journalism we do in this country and we should support it,\" he says</p><p>At just over a year on the job, the Member of Parliament for Honor&amp;#233;-Mercier and former vice-president of non-profit aid group Oxfam Quebec has been busy. His department has been working on projects including $45 million for an anti-racism strategy, cultural infrastructure projects including $8.3 million for Toronto's Massey Hall and $6 million for the Evergreen Brick Works, and $50 million in funding for festivals.</p><p>\"Why festivals? Because they gather people. It's about your friend, your family, your neighbour. It plays a social role that is also important. This is also culture.\"</p><p>Culture, he says, is that invisible bond that holds Canadians together. And perhaps something we take too much for granted.</p><p>\"You have to understand. When we got here (in the 1970s) we barely survived a bomb attack on our home. Many people we knew over the years were killed,\" says Rodriguez. \"But culture through playing Canadian music on the guitar, to learning language on television, kept me going.\"</p><p>His father told Rodriguez Canada was the land of opportunity. But please, don't get into politics. The family had had enough.</p><p>\"I think he was just being protective. But it's in the blood. Politics is the best way to change the world. And culture is the best way for Canadians to see and appreciate their world. And that's why I've always felt that it's important that everyone contribute.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The matter has come under intense scrutiny over the role of social media companies, especially larger ones like Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB[2]), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR[3]), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL[4]) (NASDAQ: GOOG[5]) in combating illicit content, including false political advertisements, hate speech, sexual harassment, and child sexual content. Bipartisan lawmakers have called for amendments to the law in a way that would expose the internet-based communications companies to more legal action related to the content on their platform. A lot of these actions are taken keeping in mind the larger or the more rogue smaller websites, but not medium-sized companies like Reddit, Craigslist, or Wikipedia, which don't have the finances of the larger companies but have a dedicated user base. Patrick Carome, one of the panelists on the Justice Department debate, argued that \"Section 230 is not just for 'big tech,\"as reported[6] by Reuters earlier. The medium-sized companies can't afford to \"operate with armies of moderators or sophisticated automation,\" he argued. Nebraska Attorney General noted that the companies don't have immunity from federal criminal prosecution, but only protests against civil claims or state-level prosecution. The law should be modified to change the latter, he argued. The panelists also discussed the limitations of encryption, including tackling child sexual abuse content in encrypted messages. Towards the end of his speech, Barr noted that the law enforcement authorities couldn't delegate the task of protecting the \"safety of the American people\" to private companies whose primary motive is to maximize profits for their shareholders. \"We must shape the incentives for companies to create a safer environment, which is what Section 230 was originally intended to do,\" Barr noted. \"The question for us, and for this Workshop, is whether those incentives are working or whether they need to be recalibrated.\"  2020 Benzinga.com.

His specialties include social media and branded content for the B2B sector. Ben can be reached via Twitter @osbennn[4].  osbennn [5]  For several years, third-party cookies have been the mainstay of online audience tracking, but now they are finally on their way out. This is hardly a shocking development for anyone who has been observing trends in the media industry, marketing technology and privacy sensitivities in recent years. And yet, amid the whirlwinds of the industry's response, it's become abundantly clear that the demise of the cookie is probably a good thing for everyone involved - audience members, publishers and even marketers. The cookie's place in historyBy way of a quick review, cookies are those small bits of code dropped onto your browser to record your user activity. They've been in use since the 1990s[6], practically the dawn of the internet, in two forms: first-party cookies, and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are those dropped by the sites you visit in order to track whether or not you're still logged in. These cookies aren't going to disappear any time soon. Third-party cookies, however, record your browsing history, user ID, session ID, and more. They're commonly used by marketers who want to know what you're interested in so they can target you with relevant ads, but cookie owners could potentially sell your data to anyone. These are the cookies that annoy internet users and privacy advocates, and they are the ones whose death so many industry professionals are talking about right now.The cookie's sudden death has been a long time comingThe cookie's demise has been written on the wall for some time. Back in 2013, Paul Cimino, a VP at Merkle, gave it just five more years[7] of life, saying that cookies are flawed and invasive, and were never intended for these purposes. Many trends have been gradually diminishing the efficacy of the cookie. They're only any use if the majority of internet users enable them, but the number of people turning off third-party cookies[8] has been steadily rising and more browser apps are switching them off by default. People generally dislike the feeling of someone tracking their every online move. In 2018, a report from Flashtalking discovered that 64% of cookies are rejected[9], either manually or with an ad blocker.As a result, today, Safari uses Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP)[10] to block cookies; Firefox applies Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP); Microsoft Internet 10 has a Do Not Track setting by default. Since Chrome is responsible for 62.5%[11] of cross-device internet usage, Google's decision to join the cookie-blocker club with its new version is only the final nail in the coffin. The company also announced in January[12] that by 2022, Chrome will stop supporting third-party cookies altogether. Recent privacy legislation like GDPR and CCPA include rules governing when and how cookies can be used, and contain complicated requirements regarding how to store and use the information they record. In 2019, the CJEU, Europe's highest court, ruled that websites must acquire the user's active consent to cookies, without presenting any pre-ticked boxes[13].Additionally, as awareness of children's online safety grows, the FTC has been issuing tighter rules about cookies on websites used by children, forcing cookie owners to carefully consider whether a child would be likely to visit their site. In parallel to these developments came the rising use of non-cookie-friendly devices for browsing the internet, such as tablets, smartphones and Kindles, cutting cookie-dependent advertisers off from programmatic ads. The booming mobile ad market provides a useful case in point for those opposed to third-party cookies, proving that it's possible to run ads without them.Behavioral advertising should crumble with the cookieOpposition to behavioral advertising in general, which is primarily enabled by third-party cookies, has been building for a while. The backlash is grounded in sentiments far more alarming than that creepy feeling you get when stalked around the internet by retargeting ads. Behavioral advertising has massively increased the power of big tech companies like Google and Facebook. Through behavioral targeting, these behemoths have created a movement of 'surveillance capitalism' that monetizes your data for ads. It bears much responsibility for the echo chambers[14] that sway elections and radicalize Islamic terrorists and white supremacists by continually feeding them more radical content that matches their current interests.Behavioral targeting has terrible power to remind us of past traumas[15] and can trigger anxiety or depression by serving up ads that hit a sensitive nerve. It can even place people in danger if, for example, a teen who is uncertain about their sexuality is 'outed' prematurely to their unaccepting family by behavioral ads that respond to their exploration of the topic online. This is why rising numbers of people are pushing to ban behavioral advertising entirely[16] in order to dismantle a system that incentivizes companies[17] to gather intimate data about our daily lives and sell it to third parties in the form of targeted ads. Many believe that a better alternative is contextual targeting, which determines which ads to display based on the topic of the web page being loaded. It makes sense, after all, to assume that someone reading an article about cat grooming might be interested in an ad for cat food, for example. Contextual ads match the expectations of the audience, don't invade anyone's privacy, and protect brands from the embarrassment many have faced recently of having their ads appear alongside extremist or adult content. In 2018, the New York Times stopped its behavioral advertising entirely in Europe in response to the introduction of GDPR, and replaced it with contextual and geolocation-based ads. To the surprise of many skeptics, its advertising revenue remained steady[18].Marketers don't need to panicMarketers' first instinct might be to panic, but third-party cookies aren't that big a loss. The truth is, for the most part, programmatic retargeting and personalized ads that relied on cookie data have failed to live up to their own hype[19]. On average, ad reach was overstated by 89%, frequency was understated by 47%, and conversion for display and video by 41% according to the aforementioned Flashtalking report. Cookie-fueled behavioral advertising forced brands to dance around the requirements of privacy regulations, hoping not to cross the line and get fined for breach of GDPR, CCPA or other privacy laws. Why not replace that tension with a better model? It's time to turn to newer, better tools.With no real workaround for the failing third-party cookie, marketers, publishers, and brands need to build a new audience analytics ecosystem. Contextual ads are returning to the spotlight, requiring marketers to innovate new ways to target and track them. But the only way to make this new ecosystem work will be to build a solid foundation of meaningful first-party data, and that in turn requires marketers and brands to work together to build a community that meaningfully engages with audience members and harnesses their support and willing cooperation. Gaining a rich view of the customer depends strongly on user feedback, reviews, surveys, and other information provided voluntarily. Consent popups aren't enough.Marketing will be forced to rediscover authenticity in brand voice and messaging, since this level of user collaboration relies on rebuilding damaged consumer trust. The challenge at hand, then, is to give people a reason to create a login account with you. Brands will still need to link together all their consumer touchpoints, including data flowing from first-party cookies that track visitor behavior on brand-owned sites and assets, and IoT data that tracks consumer preferences and behavior. Data management firms are working on creative ways to leverage first-party cookie data into anonymized segments that can guide marketers without compromising user privacy. Google suggests advertisers use its new Privacy Sandbox, a family of APIs which will allow publishers to agglomerate audience data and anonymize it for marketing use as cookie workarounds. Below is a mockup that Google released last May[20], sharing some new concepts around privacy control initiatives in the months prior to announcing the Sandbox initiative.Other walled gardens of data are springing up rapidly. Facebook and Amazon each already own significant amounts. Groups of publishers and advertisers are also banding together to consider creating a cross-platform login identity system, allowing partner organizations to share first-party data spanning media properties. Within walled gardens, ad targeting can be people-based and highly accurate. Advertisers may also need to switch to smaller campaigns, in order to resolve the problem of attribution in a cookie-less world. Attribution may rest once again on last-click, forcing ad agencies and marketers to come up with new ways to measure the effects of variants to their creative.For publishers, the fall of the cookie is a cause for celebrationPublishers are delighted about the cookie's demise. The claim that publishers benefit from targeted ads, because they sell for more than non-targeted or contextual ads, was recently revealed[21] to be nothing but a myth. It turns out that targeted ads can raise revenue by only around 4%, or $0.00008 per ad. The results of the New York Times experiment in Europe added fuel to the fire. Finally, publishers are waking up to the way that behavioral targeting risks cheapening the tone of their publication.Large publishers gather their own first-party data about audiences, which they can leverage for ad placement and measurement. However, until now, third-party cookie owners got in the way of the relationship between publishers and advertisers, preventing publishers from charging advertisers directly based on their own data. Instead of flowing to publishers, over 59% of digital ad revenue[22] goes to the duopoly of Google and Facebook, which own the platforms that own the data. With the death of the cookie, publishers can finally profit from their own data.Against the background of a weakened cookie, the Washington Post announced Zeus Prime[23], a proprietary platform for marketers to buy automated ads, in September 2019. Jarrod Dicker, The Post's VP of Commercial Technology and Development, highlighted this as a revenue opportunity for publishers to come together and take on Big Tech. Vox similarly launched[24] its ad-targeting data platform, Forte, in December. Such a move was impossible when cookies were standard, since they gave cookie-owners (namely Google and Facebook) too much power over user data.The death of the cookie opens up new opportunitiesCookies have been a useful crutch for advertisers, and learning to walk alone may be painful at first, but it's the only route to greater independence and further reach in the long run. The final death of the cookie can give rise to better harvesting and use of first-party data, a new ad ecosystem that demands more creativity, a greater alliance between publishers and advertisers, and a brave new world for all stakeholders.This post is part of our contributor series.

Bush. \"You really have to stand for something that you believe in, and you really have to be transparent about that, and you have to try to drive an outcome.\" </p><p>But Genachowski's style is to seek broad consensus, and to defer to Congress wherever possible. He doesn't like to make a decision without laboriously examining its implications. That cautious, conciliatory approach has serious drawbacks at an agency such as the FCC, the chairman of which bears primary responsibility for handling the technology world's hot-button issues -- among them the allocation of the broadcast spectrum and the licensing of television and radio stations in addition to broadband traffic regulation -- that involve billions of dollars in private sector investment and are bitterly contested by entrenched, well-funded corporate players.</p><p>Closed-door negotiations at the commission among a handful of big tech companies seeking a solution have collapsed in recent weeks, while criticism from the technology world's equivalent of the Democratic base -- the strongest proponents of Genachowski's original plans -- has intensified. \"To say that <person><nameText>Julius Genachowski </nameText></person>has been disappointing would be an understatement,\" said Josh Silver, president of Free Press, a public policy group that has led a rising chorus of criticism.</p><p>Despite a last-minute push by House Democrats in September, Congress is nowhere near ready to step in and help out the embattled FCC chairman by legislating a solution.</p><h>Great Expectations</h><p>Without firm regulations for handling online traffic, and with the FCC in jurisdictional limbo when it comes to regulating broadband, the handful of big telecommunications and cable companies that dominate the market are left to do as they please -- such as make bilateral deals with other big players. Verizon and Google did just that when they moved to fill the policy vacuum in August with their own legislative proposal.</p><p>Last year, Genachowski seemed ready to move quickly. A Harvard Law School classmate of the president's who went on to be a top aide to Reed Hundt, who was Bill Clinton's first FCC chairman, Genachowski was the lead architect of the Obama presidential campaign's technology platform, which led off with a forceful call for network neutrality, the idea that Internet access providers can't be allowed to discriminate in handling traffic on their networks. \"Obama will protect the Internet's traditional openness to innovation and creativity and ensure that it remains a platform for free speech and innovation that will benefit consumers and our democracy,\" the platform declared.</p><p>If that wasn't enough to build optimism among progressives -- and stoke fears among the handful of big telecommunications and cable companies that dominate the broadband access market -- Genachowski issued his own call for net neutrality in the speech at the Brookings Institution three months after he was confirmed by the Senate. \"Saying nothing and doing nothing would impose its own form of unacceptable cost,\" he noted.</p><p>Genachowski formally rolled out his net-neutrality proposal last October. It included six proposed commission rules, including requirements that they disclose their network management practices to customers and not discriminate in handling network traffic.</p><p>\"This means,\" he said at Brookings, \"they cannot block or degrade lawful traffic over their networks or pick winners by favoring some content or applications over others in the connection to subscribers' homes, nor can they disfavor an Internet service just because it competes with a similar service offered by that broadband provider. The Internet must continue to allow users to decide what content and what applications succeed.\"</p><p>The issue got more complicated in April, when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC lacked jurisdiction for regulating broadband Internet access. Genachowski inherited that case from his predecessor, Republican Kevin Martin, who had moved against Comcast Corp. for discriminating against certain traffic on its network.</p><p>While different experts have different interpretations of the appeals court ruling, it could certainly be used to mount a court challenge to any net-neutrality rules by companies unhappy with them. </p><p>Although such a ruling seemed likely ever since the court signaled its skepticism during oral argument last January, Genachowski didn't have a fallback plan ready to go. He waited several weeks after the court ruling to unveil his \"third way\" proposal for re-grounding the FCC's broadband jurisdiction in some, but not all, of the provisions of a section of communications law originally written to govern monopoly telephone service. </p><p>Aside from issuing a lengthy written statement, Genachowski has done little publicly to rally support for his proposal, or to drive it through the commission, where experts say he would probably be backed by the other two Democratic commissioners, Michael Copps and Mignon Clyburn.</p><p>The carriers haven't been as quiet in working to oppose the jurisdictional shift. Their Republican and Democratic allies in Congress have sent a slew of letters to Genachowski, asserting that it is entirely up to Congress to decide his agency's jurisdiction. </p><p>Over the summer, the chairman organized negotiations on net neutrality with representatives from the big carriers and a few big tech companies, including Google Inc. and Skype, to the dismay of public policy advocates. But after those talks got nowhere, Google and Verizon Inc. announced their own deal.</p><p>Under a proposal by the two corporations, Congress would give the FCC explicit but narrow authority to regulate net neutrality. But the proposal would not apply to the burgeoning world of wireless Internet services, with the exception of a transparency requirement that carriers inform customers about services and capabilities and would allow carriers to offer \"differentiated\" services to some customers.</p><p>Not long after that, the commission announced that it wanted more input on the two thorniest questions on net neutrality: how to apply regulations to wireless platforms and how to apply them to special services that carriers might offer to some customers. With that, Genachowski had effectively punted on the whole issue until after the election. </p><h>Push and Pull</h><p>House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry A. Waxman tried to help out last month, just before Congress went home to campaign. The California Democrat drafted legislation for net-neutrality regulation. In his push for a deal with Republicans who are generally wary of new federal regulations, he included provisions that would have barred the FCC, for two years, from reclassifying its jurisdiction as Genachowski proposed. But no Republican agreed to sign on, so Waxman shelved work on the issue at least until the lame-duck session -- but given the current partisan climate, probably until next year. Waxman made it clear that if Congress cannot agree soon, the FCC should take over. \"The bottom line is that we must protect the open Internet. If Congress can't act, the FCC must,\" he said.</p><p>In a recent interview, Genachowski brushed aside the notion that he is not moving fast enough on net neutrality and the commission's broadband jurisdiction. \"What we're focused on is getting these issues right for the country,\" he said. \"It's important for economic growth, for investment, for consumer empowerment, for free expression.\"</p><p>As he tries to decide what to do, Genachowski is balancing his two biggest policy goals -- net neutrality and universal broadband -- against each other. The big telecommunications companies argue that overregulation of their broadband networks will be costly and lead to less private investment, which would be critical to Genachowski's goal of ensuring that fast and affordable broadband service is available everywhere. </p><p>\"We need to preserve an innovative, competitive, open Internet,\" he said. \"We need to drive massive investment, massive private investment -- billions and billions of dollars of investment -- into wired and wireless infrastructure so that we have vast, robust Internet service. There are a set of important and complex questions that go into getting those right.\"</p><h>No Man's Land</h><p>The sort of criticism Genachowski has faced for his proposals is nothing new for the occupant of his office. \"Every FCC chairman feels he is in no man's land, with both armies shooting at him,\" said Hundt, who had the job from 1993 to 1997. \"The current chairman's situation is not unusual in any way.\"</p><p>Despite his cautious pace, Genachowski's signature proposals are both bold in scope. If implemented, the FCC would have a much firmer regulatory hand to govern the burgeoning high-speed online networks that serve as the infrastructure of the 21st century economy.</p><p>But what matters, ultimately, is not what a chairman proposes, but what he accomplishes. Genachowski's recent predecessors have wielded their clout to drive policies, despite subsequent setbacks they could and did suffer at the hands of Congress or the courts.</p><p>Powell pushed through a relaxation of regulations on the number of television stations media companies could own. Under his leadership, the FCC lifted a longstanding ban on one company owning TV stations and newspapers in the same market. That sparked a backlash in Congress, which voted to roll back part of the decision, and a court fight. Hundt drew fire while implementing the landmark telecommunications law enacted in 1996.</p><p>Even now, despite Genachowski's public pronouncements, no one is certain which way he will end up going on either of his big ideas, especially given that he's probably just about done having the most favorable congressional climate of his tenure. Assuming big, if not takeover, GOP gains in both the House and Senate, next year he'll face greater pressure to go slow with his regulatory approach. </p><p>\"They're going to have to step on the gas soon,\" Powell said of the commission. \"You can study stuff for only so long, you can collect data for only so long. At some point, the perfect becomes the enemy of the good, and you've got to start pushing the machinery to action.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOR FURTHER READING:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Broadcast spectrum, CQ Weekly, p. 1913; broadband jurisdiction,  p. 1140; network neutrality, p. 204; media  ownership rules (PL 108-199), 2003 Almanac,  p. 18-3; telecommunications overhaul  (PL 104-104), 1995 Almanac, p. 4-3. </emphasis></p><p>Source: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CQ Weekly</emphasis><br/>The definitive source for news about Congress.<br/>\u00a92010 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

He also  brainstorms ideas for new entrepreneurial tools, encourages state and city governments to crank up AI-centered economic development, and, in general, leans his optimism on the potential of well-informed, self-directed individuals-he points to trucking and security as examples of American business sectors approaching AI with positivity rather than fear. Jennings offers more polemic and less exploration than he promises, but, in the midst of expressing his strong opinions, provides a substantial framework to support readers' thinking about tech regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(May)  </emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Release Date: </emphasis>July 8, 2019</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Product Name: </emphasis>Artificial Intelligence: Rise of the Lightspeed Learners</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Product Publisher: </emphasis>Rowman &amp;

According to EY, the UK is home to 1,600 fintech companies, with over 80 per cent based in London - creating a true global fintech capital.</p><p>Concurrently, the increased adoption of the open banking standard levelled the retail playing field for fintechs, giving the end customer greater control over their data.</p><p>The listing of the Argo Blockchain - the first ever crypto firm on the main market of the London Stock Exchange - and the IPO of peer-topeer lender Funding Circle were big achievements.</p><p>And finally, two British billiondollar unicorns were anointed: the no-fee currency exchange app provider Revolut, and trendy challenger bank Monzo.</p><p>So with these major milestones behind us, what can we expect in 2019? I asked founders, chief executives, and experts in the industry, to find out what they predict for the future of fintech.</p><p>OPEN BANKING WILL COME INTO ITS OWN Christoph Rieche, co-founder and chief executive of SME lender iwoca, says: \"After its disappointing introduction this year, we expect a host of Open Banking apps to launch and go viral among consumers, thanks to the potential to save them thousands of pounds.\"</p><p>BACK-END INNOVATION IS THE NEW COOL \"Adoption of new platforms is growing at record speed, while legacy back-end technology continues to power new solutions. We don't expect to see that momentum stop,\" predicts Vinoth Jayakumar, investment director at European Venture Capital fund Draper Esprit, with confidence.</p><p>\"What we do expect is a shift in focus as new fintechs and old institutions start to think through backend infrastructure problems. Fraud, core banking systems, and real-time payments are non-sexy topics that present real challenges for incumbents and real opportunities for entrepreneurs.\"</p><p>IT'S ALL ABOUT TALENT \"Skill shortages will increase as more people are put off from coming here with Brexit,\" says Evgeny Shadchnev, chief executive of coding bootcamp Makers. \"Greater focus will therefore be placed on home-grown talent. Expect more businesses to tap into the UK government apprenticeship programme to train fintech workers.\" However, Marieke Flament, managing director of the crypto firm Circle, is rather more optimistic about skills and growth in the digital currency space.</p><p>\"We'll see a few key things in 2019: more regulatory clarity, more talent and capital flowing into the industry, and more use cases. All of this will bring us closer to the 'Tokenisation of Everything'.\"</p><p>INDUSTRIES TO CONVERGE Another hot topic in 2018 has been the ailing UK high street. Could fintechs be part of the solution? Michael Rolph, chief executive of mobile payments app Yoyo Wallet, believes that they will play a bigger role in driving the elusive omnichannel experience.</p><p>\"Research has shown that consumers are happy to share their purchase preference data in exchange for rewards, deals and offers that are personalised to them. Fintech enables retailers to harness and make the most of the power of this data.\"</p><p>TRADITIONAL INCUMBENTS SHOULD BE VERY WORRIED \"Learning from the success of top European fintech hubs, progressive regulations in the US will produce a fertile market for expansion and new entrants,\" warns Shachar Bialick, chief executive of all-in-one card company Curve.</p><p>This will force more large incumbents to adapt and protect their market share or risk being transformed into zombie record holders used solely for opening accounts with challenger banks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Michael Kent, chief executive of digital money transfer service Azimo, is anticipating global expansion and big tech's foray into fintech.</p><p>\"Driven by both growing ambition and post-Brexit business necessity, UK fintech will push beyond the EU to become much more global. Expect to see more from the Faangs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) as they move from retail and advertising dominance onto the new battleground for customers: their money.\"</p><p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BIG DATA WILL DOMINATE \"The ability for organisations to execute and adopt AI strategies will determine their success in 2019 and beyond,\" predicts Dr Stephen Christie, chief executive of behaviour analytics firm Neural Insights. \"Despite concerns over data privacy, bias and security, AI has emerged as the primary transformation tool in the digital age, and that's not going to change - especially if it solves real business problems.\"</p><p>With chaos in Westminster and Brexit dominating the news agenda, isn't it refreshing to see that the UK fintech industry will continue to be the leading light on the global stage? Something to feel good about in these tumultuous times.</p><p>\u00a3 Bindi Karia is founder and chief executive of boutique advisory firm Bindi Ventures and an ambassador for Innovate Finance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-144545933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYC-8721-DYTY-C3MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 City A.M.
