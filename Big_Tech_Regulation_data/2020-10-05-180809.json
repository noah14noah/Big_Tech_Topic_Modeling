Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday,  June 19th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one  killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near  a mosque.  Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders  in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on  the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's  Ginni Rometty among others.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is  setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate.   Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway weighed in on that, push, last  hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  But the president is forging  ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform.   You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years.  These  sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house,  now the Senate will do its work.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European  Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's  is ahead and at stake coming up.  Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming  for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of  more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning.   Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology  once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the  Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better  than 40 points.  This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p> In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their  highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the  DAX Index in Germany.  In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong  Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight.  All those  coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and  Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer  Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker.  Great conversation, great  to have you guys here today.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE:  Yes, great.  I just want  to --</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BAKER:  -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to  explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARTER:  I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is it?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI:  That will do a  billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price.  It's not that far-fetched.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a  share and 30 million shares.  Do you think that -- do you think that makes  sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue  last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the  biggest in the space.  Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming  in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.  </p><p> BAKER:  What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their  profit?  </p><p> MURPHY:  Next question, they're losing money.</p><p> BAKER:  OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's  what you think is the base.  We'll talk more about this.  President Trump  is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House  today.  Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview.   Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council  and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking  about ways to modernize the U.S. government.  Let me give you some of the  names that are going to arrive here very shortly.  Jeff Bezos from Amazon,  Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got Satya Nadella from  Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of  Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p> They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the  government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of  what's expected in the private sector but here's what Kellyanne Conway had  to say about these CEOs coming here today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CONWAY:  What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech  people are five tech experts from DOD.  Five from veterans affairs have  said, how can we get this together?  (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in  place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  You heard Kellyanne Conway refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the  president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but  the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the  U.S. government.  Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to  modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three  months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so  they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're  going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course,  artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data  and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.  </p><p> A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what  we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really  make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20  years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day.  But we have  to start now.\"  And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few  hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  We'll come back to you as news develops.   Thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning.  Turning now to  London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque  early this morning as possible act of terrorism.  One man was found dead at  the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the  actual attack.  At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members  of the public.</p><p> Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret  Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under  Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us.  Nile, good morning to you.   Thanks for joining us.</p><p> NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE  FOUNDATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth  attack in the U.K. in the last three months.  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  Yes.  Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of  London.  An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in  London.  Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one  sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people.  And  so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act  of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual.  And London  certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the  past few months.  This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of  London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly  the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you  know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of  course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave  its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six  hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way.  Here's the  negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of  talks earlier today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT:  -- our objective is  clear.  We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for  citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the  impact on borders. </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION:  We will do  all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best  interests of all citizens.  To that end, we're starting these negotiations  in a positive and constructive tone.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still  hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of  stability right now in London.  The prime minister has formed a minority  government.  She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the  DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the  British government to be able to govern effectively.  So I think that, you  know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be  derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you  know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p> And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for  two years through until the end of March 2019.  And it's going to be an  extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can  be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver  Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union  two years from now.  So there's no going back from this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think the impact is on the U.S.?  And I want to get  your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got  such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and  yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute  that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate  when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care. </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes.  And also from the point of view of the British of course,  I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United  States, and so those discussions really have already started.  And I  believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement  with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this.   And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the  special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a --  of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest  fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p> So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in  Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you  know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and  I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with  the British government in the months and years ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the  U.K. from your standpoint?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I  think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the  United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very  pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close  relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British  government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration  on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but  also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of  rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well.   So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When it comes to business, you know, the financial services  industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in  London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will  also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect  the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere  in the Eurozone like Germany?  </p><p> GARDINER:  Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to  continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far  Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center  of global finance in Europe.  I think that Brexit actually is going to  strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more  attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the  financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p> And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity  which is in my view constrains the free market actually.  So Britain  outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial  center.  So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who  operate in the United Kingdom.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching the developments, Nile.  Good to  have you on the program.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> GARDINER:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.  </p><p> Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced  the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public  between 105 and 17.  We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery  company and how it's pricing that stock.  Then cruising to the top of the  box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror.  How much the  kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend.  Back in moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government  jet, Cheryl Casone with the story.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- so Maria, this happened  yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on  U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded.   This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a  regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict.  The U.S. jet took  off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of  recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S.  Military. </p><p> Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus  continues.  Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max  which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9.   This will carry 52 additional passengers.  Boeing says it's going to  announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later  on this week.  So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set  to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning,  9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  There is the stock and the premarket.  </p><p> And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public  offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million.  According to a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer  30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere  between 15 and 17 dollars a share.  The stock will list on The New York  Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN.  Keeping it simple.   We like it when they do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young  adults.  Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian  jet that was shot down by U.S. military.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  This is an interesting story that people should keep their  eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me.  Sergey  Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet  and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity.   This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia  and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is funny.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get  away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you  know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or -- </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to  prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea  Fleet.  The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain  their level of influence.  So they look at this and they're concerned about  this.  Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various  airstrikes and the things that are going on there.  But again, the fact  that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us  about territorial integrity is absurd.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us.   That's in 10 minutes' time.  We'll continue that conversation.  On Blue  Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between,  Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17.  You said this makes sense?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it makes sense.  It's a company that's going to do billion  dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's  huge demand for this.  Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry.   You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon.  So,  yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out.  I think it will  do very well.  </p><p> CARTER:  I'm curious about retention, though, on these things.  I mean,  there is a lot of turnover.  So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of  revenue moving forward.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't  cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your  home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not  meal in a box.  </p><p> BAKER:  But they're not making money.  </p><p> BAKER:  They're not making yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not making money yet.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Oh, fine.  Bring that up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, President Trump talks  tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House  today for a meeting.  We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff  Bezos.  Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T.  system.  What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next.   General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker  bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.  Why G.M. is moving back  across the border.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants headed to Washington today,  the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council  Summit.  Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO  Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others.  They're expected to discuss  ways to modernize the government through technology.  </p><p> I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb.  Charlie, good to see you.   Thanks for joining the conversation.  And your launching DisruptDC today,  it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections.   What do you hope to see from the meeting today? </p><p> CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC:  Well, first of all, I think  it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact.   We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've  seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the  veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even  the office of personnel management being hacked.  So we've got the  capability to get this right.  To disrupt the way business is currently  been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one  thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is  our dysfunctional government. </p><p> MURPHY:  It's Mike Murphy here.  I -- I'm hoping that when these business  leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack  how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the  people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and  left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda  can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move  that on to tax reform or health care reform.  Is there -- is that part of  this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p> KOLB:  Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda,  this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of  political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American  people need, what our government needs in order to function.  We want to  see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public  policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more  broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall. </p><p> BAKER:  Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike  on the show this morning.  Do you think it's really realistic to talk about  something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's  environment? </p><p> KOLB:  Look, I'm an optimist.  If you got good ideas there's a public need,  I'm convinced that we can break through this.  I mean, this situation now,  it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership  from the business community and we can make a difference.  I've seen it  before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the  committee for economic development.  We have an impact on campaign finance  reform, early childhood education.  Business is an important voice here and  again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the  American people that people can come together and get things done, we need  this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about getting things done in terms of the agenda?  I mean,  you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday  Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see  things like health care reform and tax reform this year.  Listen to this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  The Senate once again is empowering the  Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the  majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish,  much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington,  D.C.  So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm  afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the  kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to  complement. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of  gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on  right now.  Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we  actually going to get movement on this agenda? </p><p> KOLB:  Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our  elected officials.  Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan  working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax  reform through.  They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it  lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that  again.  So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately,  things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in  Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this  vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and  finding a way to do this.  I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KOLB:  I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want  a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two  percent which is just unacceptable. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, that's why we want to see if this actually  happens this year.  Charlie, good to have your insights.  Thanks so much. </p><p> KOLB:  You're welcome.  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Charlie Kolb joining us there.  We'll be watching.  </p><p> Coming up.

Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent  increases in premiums.  Vote for Karen Handel.\"  That, of course, he refers  to the Georgia Special Election.  Meanwhile, technology executives descend  on the White House today.  Top leaders in the industry set to focus on  updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's  Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and IBM's Ginni Rometty.  Counsel to  the President, Kellyanne Conway, weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech  people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said  how can we get this together?  Voila!  Now, we have a system in place where  veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House.  He  is closer to becoming the world's richest person.  The Whole Food deal  announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared,  or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because  of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal.

And in  Asia, overnight, markets finished higher.  The best performer is in Hong  Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent.

Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the  box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide  with a full box office recap coming your way.  First off, breaking news out  of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern  London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured.   British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack.   Here's what Counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told me earlier  about how the White House is responding.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CONWAY:  The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation  throughout the night.  I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned  with their British counterparts.  And since it looks like British  government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to  see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies  any way that they need.  We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy  Advisor, Walid Phares.  Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  the conversation.  </p><p> WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Sure, thank  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack  in the last three months.  </p><p> PHARES:  Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine  exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the  perpetrator.  But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously,  and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it?   There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is,  let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act.  But what is more important  is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry  about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a  network that is now going to engage?  Hopefully, not in such acts.  So,  British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is  this act about?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this  was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims.  Does  that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the  others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?  </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west,  including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda --  Jihadist in general terms.  So, what we have been seeing over the past  weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks.  This would be first time  or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration  or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter  the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists  would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban  clashes.  And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very,  very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual  citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or  knives, or others, and then take action.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BAKER:  Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous  attack, to any attack.  From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't  change, you still do the same thing.  You get your hands on the  perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what  is their network?  Do they have another associate?  It's the same process.   This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.  </p><p> But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders  in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know,  condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare?   Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration  from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the  horror from the British leaders, as to this attack.  Sometimes after an  attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from  leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that? </p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely, you're right.  I mean, technically speaking,  authorities will treat it the same.  They will investigate everything that  connects to it -- that's on a tactical level.  On the strategic level, if  the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and  others are going to be saying about it.  And I think they are a little bit  more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and  they have constructed a narrative.  Now, what is that they're going to say  about this?  They don't want to go too far because this would push more  people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same.  And they  want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a  response to previous attacks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PHARES:  They need to explain to the British public that this should not be  -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or  having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology.  It  is very important for them to act now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other  story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it  attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa.  Russia's Defense Ministry  reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in  Syria as targets after this incident.  Walid, what's your reaction?  </p><p> PHARES:  I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the  statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous  situation.  This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right  now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to  take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian  border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe  zone.  What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to  stop us from doing it.  So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is  flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now.  But  now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as  enemies: this is a serious escalation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker, what's your take on this?  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree  completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now.  Russians  are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen.   And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the  Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na&lt;ve, in a sense.  Russia has  completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think  they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments  about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to  respect Syria's territorial integrity.  This is taking it one step further  saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets. </p><p> MURPHY:  You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right?  I mean, our jet was  attacked, and shot down another jet, right?  So, you can't --</p><p> BAKER:  We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the  Russians at this point.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and  conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need  unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home  because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's  been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has  to stand their ground here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into  this conflict.  </p><p> CARTER:  I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all  of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start  to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average  person?  Do people feel safe?  What's this going to mean for our world  leaders?  They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make  sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a  whole other set of implications.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels  like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\"  they're basically putting us on notice.  </p><p> PHARES:  Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PHARES:  Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria,  you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime.   You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS  in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the  response of the U.S., in my view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will leave it there.  Walid, we'll watch the developments.   Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us  there.  Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state;  while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas.   Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a  big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S.   Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange.  Nic,  good morning to you. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We are  seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into  United States.  This is all about parts and the like in Arlington.  With  that, they will be bringing more jobs.  This goes with Trump's agenda.  You  noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies  decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border  tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that.  You can see  General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs,  Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those  GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well.  More jobs in the United States  of America.</p><p> We are moving to the golf game right now.  We know that yesterday was the  U.S. Open.  We saw that Koepka wins it all.  And so who is going to  sponsor?  Back in 2012, he went pro.  He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an  offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just  putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing.  You can see Nike looking to  upside.  But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100  percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs.  The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together.   We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway,  just to name a few. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nicole, thank you.  We want to look at Nike.  What  do you think?  This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you  know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week.  But now you have  the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open. </p><p> MURPHY:  It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much.  But  it is a positive.  It helps him move past one big golf personality who is  kind of in some trouble right now.  I think the young guns on PGA Tour are  awesome.  They're elevating the game.  So many different people can step up  on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation  going on right now.  The last couple months, tech underperformed.  First,  you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see  Amazon up this morning.  A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech  but it's also -- what about financials?  Is there a rotation going on?</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I think a rotation out of the market.  A lot of big tech  names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half  ago.  So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent.  Remember, Apple,  which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about  six percent.  Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into  tech sector.  This is the one area you are going to still see growth.  You  look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is.  So a lot of  money is going to continue to go there.  I am looking at financials, though  because I think we need financials to get the market.  It's next leg up.   You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to  be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go  in financials?  Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p> MURPHY:  A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went  into some big industrial names.  So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the  Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ got hit hard as  the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking  for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting  new highs. </p><p> BAKER:  Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really  spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention,  what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest  problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market  where it is.  So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any  sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can  go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter.  That's a good  backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the  box office this weekend.  The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman  in the opening weekend.  We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in  a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in  central Portugal.  Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters  battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were  found dead in their vehicle.  Others were found near a road that road golf  with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning  homes.  Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning  strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon. </p><p> Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's  stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five  billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the  wealthiest person in the world.  Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here  is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company  announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning  which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket. </p><p> And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box  office.  Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one  of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the  franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time  anyway their about $53.5 million.  Now Wonder Woman they go into second  place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box  office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million  overseas, not to be outdone.  OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to  analysts All Eyes on Me.  It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in  27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top  the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down.  So girl power continuing  to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've  got more but I'm out of time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman. </p><p> CASONE:  You did?  And what would you think? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Girl power all the way.  I didn't know the story of when she  was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl.  The  technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to  Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money  to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.  I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up;  it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date.  So go against the trend probably  but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think  Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do  against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside  there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to  talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts  from our all-star panel next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star  panel, Mike Baker. </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, keeping an eye on Syria.  I know there's a lot going on  elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very  important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians.  One last  thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody.  My  father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man  I'll ever know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a  really beautiful sentiment.  Michael Murphy.</p><p> MURPHY:  A tough act to follow.  I agree, happy father's day to everybody  and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's  coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You think it does well? </p><p> MURPHY:  I think it does. </p><p> CARTER:  You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne  put it.  I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where  people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward.  It's  time, let's do it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow  with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so  much for joining us this morning.

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>And it is Monday, June 19th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning, London has been targeted again at least one killed, several others injured after a man plows his van into a crowd near a mosque. Police are treating this as terrorist attack this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology executives are descending on the White House today, top leaders in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. system on the CEOs attending, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft's <person><nameText>Satya Nadella, </nameText></person>IBM's Ginni Rometty among others.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agenda also top priorities, Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>is setting a July 4th deadline for a health care vote out of the Senate. <person><nameText>Counselor </nameText></person>to the President, <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway </nameText></person>weighed in on that, push, last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>KELLYANNE CONWAY, </nameText></person><person><nameText>COUNSELOR </nameText></person>TO THE PRESIDENT: But the president is forging ahead, he's in close contact with Leader McConnell on health care reform. You know, Obamacare has been a long live for over seven years. These sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the house, now the Senate will do its work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Britain is working on its exit from the European Union, the negotiations under way today, beginning today, a look at what's is ahead and at stake coming up. Blue Apron set the range for an upcoming for initial public offering, the details as the company seeks evaluation of more than $3 billion dollars, pricing 30 million shares this morning. Futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, technology once again leadership here, tech stocks are leading the markets with the Dow Industrials up 73 points right here, NASDAQ expected to be up better than 40 points. This right here, that's the high of the morning.</p><p>In Europe, also strength although the European indices are off of their highs, the CAC quarante in Paris is still up almost one percent, as is the DAX Index in Germany. In Asia overnight, markets finished higher with Hong Kong the best performer, up better than one percent overnight. All those coming up and this morning, joining me to talk all about it, Maslansky and Partners President, Lee Carter, Rosecliff Capital chief executive officer Mike Murphy and Diligence President, Mike Baker. Great conversation, great to have you guys here today.</p><p>MIKE BAKER. PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER. DILIGENCE: Yes, great. I just want to --</p><p>LEE <person><nameText>CARTER, PRESIDENT, </nameText></person>MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here.</p><p>BAKER: -- just maybe above my abilities or my pay grade, I'm loss to explain how Blue Apron is valuing at $3 billion.</p><p>CARTER: I mean, I want to know with their attention right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is it?</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, EF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL CHI: That will do a billion in revenue, three-billion-dollar price. It's not that far-fetched.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They say they want to price it between 15 and 17 dollars a share and 30 million shares. Do you think that -- do you think that makes sense?</p><p>MURPHY: I think it's fair, it's a company that did 800 million in revenue last year, that will do a billion in revenue this year and they're the biggest in the space. Now, Amazon and Whole Foods getting together coming in there, could mean something else, but I think this evaluation is fair.</p><p>BAKER: What's the bottom line, what are they making and what's their profit?</p><p>MURPHY: Next question, they're losing money.</p><p>BAKER: OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They are losing money but they are growing revenue and that's what you think is the base. We'll talk more about this. President Trump is meeting with some of the nation's top technology CEOs at the White House today. Adam Shapiro is at the White House right now with the preview. Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: And a good morning to you, Maria. This is the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council and the biggest names in technology will be here for several hours talking about ways to modernize the U.S. government. Let me give you some of the names that are going to arrive here very shortly. Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Safra Catz from Oracle, Tim Cook from Apple, you've got <person><nameText>Satya Nadella </nameText></person>from Microsoft, the CEO from IBM and of course, Eric Schmidt, chairman of Alphabet, the company we used to call Google.</p><p>They're going to be discussing ways to streamline the I.T. services in the government which in some cases 10 to 20 years behind current status of what's expected in the private sector but here's what <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway </nameText></person>had to say about these CEOs coming here today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY: What Jared did, he invited in the five -- the five brightest tech people are five tech experts from DOD. Five from veterans affairs have said, how can we get this together? (INAUDIBLE) now we have a system in place where veterans are retreated as one single patient seamlessly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: You heard <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway </nameText></person>refer to Jared, Jared Kushner who the president charged with overseeing a streamlining of the U.S. government but the president also signed on May 1st an executive order to modernize the U.S. government. Some of the topics the CEOs will be discussing on ways to modernize, electronic medical records, you can take anywhere from three months to six months to transfer medical records to the V.A. system, so they're going to try and streamline that, the H-1B visa program, they're going to try to eliminate fraud in that program, and then, of course, artificial intelligence focusing on machine learning as well as big data and the ways that the U.S. government can securely store data in the cloud.</p><p>A senior administration official talking to Fox Business said, here is what we can expect, \"These are things that are going to require years to really make significant progress on and our systems are in some cases 10 to 20 years out of date, so we're not going to fix that in one day. But we have to start now.\" And now Maria is today, they will be here in the next few hours and the president will meet with them toward the end of the day. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Adam. We'll come back to you as news develops. Thank you. Adam Shapiro at the White House this morning. Turning now to London, British authorities are investigating the van attack near a mosque early this morning as possible act of terrorism. One man was found dead at the scene, although it is still unclear if that death was related to the actual attack. At least 10 others have been wounded, the driver, a 48- year-old man, he was arrested at the scene after being detained by members of the public.</p><p>Joining me right now, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher, center for freedom and former foreign policy director under Margaret Thatcher, Nile Gardiner is with us. Nile, good morning to you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILE GARDINER, DIRECTOR OF MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR FREEDOM, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the act of violence in London, the fourth attack in the U.K. in the last three months.</p><p>GARDINER: Yes. Yes. Another abhorrent terrorist attack on the streets of London. An act of real callous disregard for human life once again in London. Although in this particular case it seems to be the actions of one sole individual who seem to have a sort of hatred for Muslim people. And so we have a number of casualties at this time but this is certainly an act of, you know, of tremendous evil by this particular individual. And London certainly I think has been under sort of state of -- sort of siege over the past few months. This is the fourth act of terrorism on the streets of London in recent -- in recent months and I think that, you know, certainly the city is on very, very high alert but without a doubt, of course, you know, London I think is a very, very resilient city but it does face, of course, an immense, you know, threat from terrorism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, almost exactly a year after Britain voted to leave its biggest market, formal negotiations on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union are getting under way today in Brussels, I guess it's six hours ahead there, the negotiation is all under way. Here's the negotiations on -- negotiators on both sides I just say at the outset of talks earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, EUROPEAN CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FOR BREXIT: -- our objective is clear. We must first tackle uncertainties caused by Brexit first for citizens but also for the beneficiaries of the E.U. policies and for the impact on borders.</p><p>DAVID DAVIS, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION: We will do all that we can to ensure that we deliver a deal that works in the best interests of all citizens. To that end, we're starting these negotiations in a positive and constructive tone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, what are you expecting, Prime Minister Theresa May still hasn't formed a new government, so, is that affecting the talks?</p><p>GARDINER: Well, I do think we have, you know, a certain degree of stability right now in London. The prime minister has formed a minority government. She is in discussions with the democratic union as part of the DUP, the Northern Irish party in terms of a deal that will allow the British government to be able to govern effectively. So I think that, you know, the Brexit process is certainly under way, it's not going to be derailed by this recent on election and I think you are going to see a, you know, a conservative government in place delivering Brexit.</p><p>And so the negotiations kicked off today, those negotiations will last for two years through until the end of March 2019. And it's going to be an extremely tough negotiating process, there's no doubt about it but you can be certain of one thing, the British government has pledged to deliver Brexit to the British people and Britain will be out of the European Union two years from now. So there's no going back from this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think the impact is on the U.S.? And I want to get your reaction to what's going on in the U.S. given the fact that we've got such obstructionism going on, the president has communicated an agenda and yet the critics just -- are pushing back and not allowing him to execute that agenda, when it comes to health care reform awaiting on the Senate when it comes to tax reform or waiting on health care.</p><p>GARDINER: Yes. And also from the point of view of the British of course, I mean, they're very keen to strike a free trade agreement with the United States, and so those discussions really have already started. And I believe that President Trump is very strongly in favor of such an agreement with the United Kingdom as full momentum also on Capitol Hill for this. And so, I hope that, you know, we are going to see the strengthening of the special relationship over the coming years and the implementation of a -- of a free trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. of the world's biggest fifth largest economies as soon as Britain leaves the European Union.</p><p>So I hope that this isn't derailed by all the internal politics here in Washington which frankly has been extremely sort of corrosive and, you know, the special relationship is extremely important to U.S. interests and I'd expect to see the Trump administration working very, very closely with the British government in the months and years ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what is the perception of the Trump administration in the U.K. from your standpoint?</p><p>GARDINER: Well, I think it's, you know, it's rather mixed, and certainly I think opinion polls show that President Trump isn't hugely popular in the United Kingdom at this time but the British government has struck a very pragmatic note, I think Theresa May has cultivated a very close relationship with President Trump and I think that, you know, the British government is very, very keen to work closely with the Trump administration on a wide array, but not only of course, on the trade and Brexit issues but also with regard to the transatlantic security cooperation in the face of rising Islamist threat and also in terms of defense, cooperation as well. So I think -- but -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When it comes to business, you know, the financial services industry -- the U.S. financial services industry has a real foothold in London, is that going to be part of a trade deal do you think where it will also impact services or jobs -- American jobs in London or do you expect the financial services industry to have to move lots of people to somewhere in the Eurozone like Germany?</p><p>GARDINER: Yes -- no, I expect that, you know, U.S. businesses are going to continue to thrive and prosper in the United Kingdom and London is by far Europe's biggest financial center, it's going to continue to be the center of global finance in Europe. I think that Brexit actually is going to strengthen the British economy, it's going to make London even more attractive place to do business, once the City of London is freed from the financial shackles of E.U. membership.</p><p>And the European Union has become a sort of big government driven entity which is in my view constrains the free market actually. So Britain outside of the European Union will do even better as a global financial center. So there's nothing to fear for U.S. investors and companies who operate in the United Kingdom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching the developments, Nile. Good to have you on the program. Thank you so much.</p><p>GARDINER: My pleasure. Thank you very much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nile Gardiner joining us there, Heritage.</p><p>Still, to come, Blue Apron cooks up plans for a public debut, they priced the IPO this morning, they're looking at 30 million shares to go public between 105 and 17. We're taking a look in the (INAUDIBLE) delivery company and how it's pricing that stock. Then cruising to the top of the box office, Cars 3 puts Wonder Woman in the rearview mirror. How much the kid--friendly blockbuster hold in this weekend. Back in moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government jet, Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well -- so Maria, this happened yesterday near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, the Syrian warplane fired on U.S.-backed rebels and the U.S. pilot in a F-18 Super Hornet responded. This is the first time in Syria's Civil War that a U.S. pilot has struck a regime plane that marks a new tactic in this conflict. The U.S. jet took off from the USS George H.W. Bush and this incident follows a number of recent moves against the Assad Regime and Iranian-backed forces by the U.S. Military.</p><p>Well, the battle for dominance in the sky between Boeing and Airbus continues. Boeing's board has approved a super stretch version of 737 Max which is going to be five and a half feet longer and the current 737 Max 9. This will carry 52 additional passengers. Boeing says it's going to announce orders and commitments for more than 240 of these new planes later on this week. So this jet set to debut 2020 but look at this, Boeing set to add more than a dozen points in the Dow and trading starts this morning, 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. There is the stock and the premarket.</p><p>And then finally this Blue Apron has set terms of its initial public offering with an expectation to raise up $510 million. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company could offer 30 million shares for their launch and the price expected to be somewhere between 15 and 17 dollars a share. The stock will list on The New York Stock Exchange, Maria, under the ticker symbol APRN. Keeping it simple. We like it when they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Blue Apron will popular among millennials, young adults. Before we get to that, you want to make a comment on the Syrian jet that was shot down by U.S. military.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. This is an interesting story that people should keep their eyes on but in a remarkable example of you've got to be kidding me. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister came out after we took down this jet and said that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity. This is Russia talking about after their troops have rolled into Georgia and they took over Crimea, there's Ukraine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is funny.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. And so this is the world we live in nowadays and he can get away with saying that and, you know, some people will buy into it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will that supposed to be sort of a warning shot, Russia, you know, Russia is watching what the U.S. is doing to Syria or --</p><p>BAKER: Yes. And they're -- look, they're worried, I mean, they want to prop up Assad, obviously, they got their own report there for the Black Sea Fleet. The only reason they're there is because they want to maintain their level of influence. So they look at this and they're concerned about this. Now, we did conflict with the Russians all the time on these various airstrikes and the things that are going on there. But again, the fact that Sergey Lavrov would make this comment to us and try to lecture us about territorial integrity is absurd.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to talk with you about that when Walid Phares joins us. That's in 10 minutes' time. We'll continue that conversation. On Blue Apron, 30 million shares -- they want to price 30 million shares between, Mike Murphy, between 15 and 17. You said this makes sense?</p><p>MURPHY: I think it makes sense. It's a company that's going to do billion dollars in revenue, they're pricing their company $3 billion and there's huge demand for this. Remember, grocery is an 800-billion-dollar industry. You just saw Whole Foods is going to be acquired on Friday by Amazon. So, yes, this is the first of the big meal boxes coming out. I think it will do very well.</p><p>CARTER: I'm curious about retention, though, on these things. I mean, there is a lot of turnover. So it can may -- can may keep up that kind of revenue moving forward.</p><p>MURPHY: I think they can, they have big gross margins because it doesn't cost them a lot to do what they're doing and I think once they're in your home, they have other opportunities to other sources of revenue just not meal in a box.</p><p>BAKER: But they're not making money.</p><p>BAKER: They're not making yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not making money yet.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. Amazon didn't make money for 15 years.</p><p>MURPHY: Oh, fine. Bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, President Trump talks tech, the biggest names in the tech industry headed to the White House today for a meeting. We are previewing Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon Jeff Bezos. Among the names looking to help upgrade the government's I.T. system. What else is on that agenda for the meeting, that's up next. General Motors, meanwhile, hiring shifts into high gear, the automaker bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas. Why G.M. is moving back across the border. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Technology giants headed to Washington today, the White House is hosting its inaugural American Technology Council Summit. Today, those attending include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty among others. They're expected to discuss ways to modernize the government through technology.</p><p>I want to bring in DisruptDC Charlie Kolb. Charlie, good to see you. Thanks for joining the conversation. And your launching DisruptDC today, it is a nonpartisan business coalition for better government in elections. What do you hope to see from the meeting today?</p><p>CHARLIE KOLB, CEO AND PRESIDENT, DISRUPTDC: Well, first of all, I think it's a good that the president is holding this summit and here's the fact. We have the technology now to upgrade government from end-to-end, we've seen disasters in the Affordable Care Act rollout problems with the veterans administration, political campaigns being hacked, banks and even the office of personnel management being hacked. So we've got the capability to get this right. To disrupt the way business is currently been done and Harvard professor Michael Porter said that the number one thing standing in the way of greater competitiveness and economic growth is our dysfunctional government.</p><p>MURPHY: It's Mike Murphy here. I -- I'm hoping that when these business leaders meet with President Trump today, although it's important to attack how technology is going to help the government and to interact with the people, I'm hoping it kind of brings together both sides, you know, and left, right, republican, democrat and realize that working on one agenda can really advance that and it move all of us forward and then maybe move that on to tax reform or health care reform. Is there -- is that part of this? Could that -- am I being too optimistic here?</p><p>KOLB: Not in the least, I mean, this is a nonpartisan, bipartisan agenda, this is a real opportunity to make progress to cut through all the sort of political garbage here and really function -- focus on what the American people need, what our government needs in order to function. We want to see also technology applied to elections and better voting, the way public policy is made and that's the point you just raised, Mike, and then more broadly, in terms of how the government functions overall.</p><p>BAKER: Hey, Charlie, Mike Baker here, because we only have guys named Mike on the show this morning. Do you think it's really realistic to talk about something that could be done in nonpartisan, bipartisan manner in today's environment?</p><p>KOLB: Look, I'm an optimist. If you got good ideas there's a public need, I'm convinced that we can break through this. I mean, this situation now, it's unfortunate but we need leadership, bipartisan leadership, leadership from the business community and we can make a difference. I've seen it before, I ran public policy business-led, think tank for 15 years, the committee for economic development. We have an impact on campaign finance reform, early childhood education. Business is an important voice here and again, I think exactly this type of technology council here can show the American people that people can come together and get things done, we need this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about getting things done in terms of the agenda? I mean, you know, yesterday I spoke with Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks on Sunday Morning Futures who walked through whether or not we are going to see things like health care reform and tax reform this year. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA: The Senate once again is empowering the Democrats to be obstructionist and to block why President Trump, why the majority of house and majority of the Senate was elected to accomplish, much of dissatisfaction of all those voters of Senate through Washington, D.C. So unless the Senate changes the way in which they operate, I'm afraid you're going to continue to see this kind of deadlock without the kind of improvements that the people sent us to Washington, D.C. to complement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Charlie, you say DisruptDC is trying to break that type of gridlock in Washington and yet, you've got all the finger-pointing going on right now. Why is the Senate sitting on the health care bill, when are we actually going to get movement on this agenda?</p><p>KOLB: Well, it's a matter of public will, I think, and also among our elected officials. Look, Maria, in 1986, Ronald Reagan forged a bipartisan working group, Senator Bill Bradley, Dan Rostenkowski and they got tax reform through. They cleared out a lot of the mess in the tax reform, it lasted for 20 some years, the barnacles have grown back, we need to do that again. So there are examples when we done it before and unfortunately, things like happened in the neighborhood not too far from my house in Alexandria, Virginia last week, show the importance of putting aside this vitriol and for people in the Congress of good will coming together and finding a way to do this. I mean, frankly, the American people want this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KOLB: I think they want tax reform, they want lower regulations, they want a government that works and they want growth that's greater than two percent which is just unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Well, that's why we want to see if this actually happens this year. Charlie, good to have your insights. Thanks so much.</p><p>KOLB: You're welcome. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Charlie Kolb joining us there. We'll be watching.</p><p>Coming up. Tragedy rocks London yet again, at least one person is dead, nearly a dozen others injured after a man plows van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern London. What we know about the attacker this morning. Three -- we've got four terrorist attacks in three months in London.</p><p>Jeff Bezos surged toward the title of world's richest man continues. The Amazon founder closing in on Bill Gates after the company's deal to acquire Whole Foods. The soaring net worth still ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Monday morning! Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>and it is Monday, June 19th, your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. London on edge again, this morning; at least one person has been killed, several injured after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque. British Prime Minister, Theresa May, calling the attack sickening the latest on the investigation, coming up.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump tweeting on the agenda just moments ago, here's what he said: \"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare, and border security. Their Obamacare is dead with 100 percent increases in premiums. Vote for Karen Handel.\" That, of course, he refers to the Georgia Special Election. Meanwhile, technology executives descend on the White House today. Top leaders in the industry set to focus on updating the government's I.T. Systems among the CEOs attending: Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft's <person><nameText>Satya Nadella, </nameText></person>and IBM's Ginni Rometty. Counsel to the President, <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway, </nameText></person>weighed in on the meeting last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY: The Chair, he didn't invite in five, the five brightest tech people or five tech experts from DOD, five from Veterans Affairs, and said how can we get this together? Voila! Now, we have a system in place where veterans will be treated as one single patient seamlessly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Plus, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, also headed to White House. He is closer to becoming the world's richest person. The Whole Food deal announcements helping him climb the ranks yesterday; his net worth soared, or last week his net worth soared all the way up above $80 million because of the movement of stock on the Whole Foods deal. General Motors moving jobs back to the U.S.; the detail as the automaker announces plans to open a new plant in Texas.</p><p>And markets are higher this morning; Futures indicating a rally at the opening of trading for the tune of 70 points on the Dow Industrial Average, 50 points on the NASDAQ composite. In Europe, this morning, also the indices are across the board up. Take a look, FTSE 100 up one-half of one percent, the CAC40 and the Dax Index both up almost one percent. And in Asia, overnight, markets finished higher. The best performer is in Hong Kong with Hang Seng Index up better than one percent. Brooks Koepka, making a name for himself at U.S. Open.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Koepka, a major champion</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The impact on one of his main sponsors; we'll take a look at the shares of Nike coming up. Plus, Cars 3, races at the top spot at the box office; it did not slow down Wonder Woman sales, however, worldwide with a full box office recap coming your way. First off, breaking news out of London after a man plows a van into a crowd near a mosque in Northern London; at least one person was killed, several people have been injured. British authorities are treating this incident as a terrorist attack. Here's what Counsel to the President, <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway, </nameText></person>told me earlier about how the White House is responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY: The President and his counterterrorism team assess a situation throughout the night. I know our counterterrorism experts were concerned with their British counterparts. And since it looks like British government is treating this as a possible act of terrorism, we'll wait to see how that investigation unfolds, and we're there to support our allies any way that they need. We just don't want this to become the new normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Advisor, Walid Phares. Walid, good to see you, thanks so much for joining the conversation.</p><p>WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR: Sure, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what took place in London; the fourth attack in the last three months.</p><p>PHARES: Well, first of all, U.K. authorities would have to determine exactly what that was, they need to release more information about the perpetrator. But on whole of it, Maria, this is a terror act, obviously, and you just mentioned something very important: where can we place it? There were three Jihadi attacks over the past three weeks, and this is, let's call it, it's an anti-Muslim terror act. But what is more important is to determine: is this the act of somebody who was frustrated and angry about the previous Jihadi attacks or is there more to it, or is there a network that is now going to engage? Hopefully, not in such acts. So, British authorities now have the key in their hands to determine: what is this act about?</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fact that this was obviously -- well, we're being told this was a white man nothing to do, you know, he wanted to kill Muslims. Does that change anything in terms of the nature of this attack versus the others where they were ISIS sympathizers or ISIS took responsibility?</p><p>PHARES: Absolutely. I mean, Britain, France, many countries in the west, including the Arab-Muslim world have been targeted by ISIS, Al Qaeda -- Jihadist in general terms. So, what we have been seeing over the past weeks and months are waves of Jihadist attacks. This would be first time or so where you're going to have probably an individual who has frustration or anger, or has an ideology -- that we don't know, but this is a counter the previous Jihadi attack, and this is, this is what actually Jihadists would like to see happening in the West: create the conditions for urban clashes. And why U.K. authorities, European authorities have to be very, very focused on what's happening and making sure that citizens, individual citizens don't take weapons into their own hands; should there be a car, or knives, or others, and then take action.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BAKER: Absolutely correct in terms of this attack compared to the previous attack, to any attack. From an investigative standpoint, it doesn't change, you still do the same thing. You get your hands on the perpetrator; if they're not killed in the incident, and you determine what is their network? Do they have another associate? It's the same process. This is, obviously, is different in the sense of the target.</p><p>But Walid, just curious, in terms of the response from the British leaders in the immediate aftermath of this attack, and their immediate, you know, condemnation obviously, of course, of the attack, how does that compare? Do we see -- I guess this -- I've already heard this morning frustration from some folks, who feel as if, OK, we saw immediate condemnation and the horror from the British leaders, as to this attack. Sometimes after an attack, there's frustration that we don't see same condemnation from leaders within the Muslim world about an attack; any thoughts on that?</p><p>PHARES: Absolutely, you're right. I mean, technically speaking, authorities will treat it the same. They will investigate everything that connects to it -- that's on a tactical level. On the strategic level, if the narrative, it's what the Prime Minister, Members of Government, and others are going to be saying about it. And I think they are a little bit more concerned than usual because they know what the Jihadist threat is and they have constructed a narrative. Now, what is that they're going to say about this? They don't want to go too far because this would push more people to do the same, more frustrated people to do the same. And they want to define it as it is, because now -- let's put it that way, this is a response to previous attacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PHARES: They need to explain to the British public that this should not be -- that citizens should not be taking justice into their own hands, or having an ideology that would be comparable to an extremist ideology. It is very important for them to act now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get your reaction as well as Mike Baker on this other story where a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after it attacked American-backed fighters near Raqqa. Russia's Defense Ministry reportedly saying that they will treat the U.S. led coalition planes in Syria as targets after this incident. Walid, what's your reaction?</p><p>PHARES: I have been developing over past few weeks, you know, the statement, the analysis that we are heading in Syria to a very dangerous situation. This is probably the most dangerous spot on the planet right now: Eastern Syria, because we are helping local allies on the ground to take Raqqa, we are other allies in the South and the Jordanian-Iraqi-Syrian border to also go against ISIS and create that zone, a free zone, a safe zone. What the Iranians, and Hezbollah, and Assad are trying to do is to stop us from doing it. So, the ascending their militia, and the regime is flying those planes, so we did warn them twice, and three times now. But now, that Russia is going to say, well, we're going to treat you as enemies: this is a serious escalation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mike Baker, what's your take on this?</p><p>BAKER: Yes, this is a really important story to watch, and I agree completely with Walid that this is a critical hot spot right now. Russians are not going to give up their position in Syria, it's not going to happen. And this idea that somehow our interests intersect in Syria, as in the Russians in terms of fighting ISIS is na\u2039ve, in a sense. Russia has completely different motivations and agenda for being there, and I think they've made it clear; Sergey Lavrov, their Foreign Minister's comments about this, he's putting down a marker saying that the U.S. needs to respect Syria's territorial integrity. This is taking it one step further saying they're going to look at our aircraft as targets.</p><p>MURPHY: You know, Mike, we needed to do this, right? I mean, our jet was attacked, and shot down another jet, right? So, you can't --</p><p>BAKER: We have to stay up front; we have to be very firm, with the Russians at this point.</p><p>MURPHY: I think this underscores the fact that we have so much tension and conflict globally, that at home we need to underscore the fact that we need unity; we need to be together, not fight against each other here at home because there's plenty of places globally that people want to attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but look how Russia is reacting.</p><p>MURPHY: I think we have to so -- we didn't want this conflict, but it's been brought to us now, and I think the President and the United States has to stand their ground here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And let's not forget, Russia inserted themselves into this conflict.</p><p>CARTER: I mean, that's right, and I think that when we're looking at all of this right now, you're going to see voters, globally, are going to start to get more and more nervous, and what does this mean for the average person? Do people feel safe? What's this going to mean for our world leaders? They're really going to need to step up and unify us and make sure that we feel confident, because if we use confidence, then, there's a whole other set of implications.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the language coming out of the Russians, Walid, just feels like saying that, \"we're going to look at these planes as the target,\" they're basically putting us on notice.</p><p>PHARES: Look, they are crossing a red line themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>PHARES: Because we unofficially told them: look, you are in Western Syria, you have that base, you are on the coast, you are protecting Assad regime. You know, we have made a lot confession, but we are operating against ISIS in Eastern Syria; you have no business in Eastern Syria: that should be the response of the U.S., in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will leave it there. Walid, we'll watch the developments. Thanks so much for weighing in this morning, Walid Phares, joining us there. Coming up, General Motors revs up hiring in the lone star state; while the automaker is bringing hundreds of jobs from Mexico to Texas. Then a-swing-a-swosh: Brooks Koepka's historic U.S. Open victory is also a big victory for Nike; what his first major win means for his sponsor, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General Motors will move 600 jobs out of Mexico into the U.S. Nicole Petallides covering story live on the U.S. stock exchange. Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Maria. We are seeing General Motors like so many other companies moving those jobs into United States. This is all about parts and the like in Arlington. With that, they will be bringing more jobs. This goes with Trump's agenda. You noted he would be the greatest jobs President whether these companies decided to do so because of the previously planned or worried about border tax or massive agreement of some sort of change with that. You can see General Motors in the downside but General Motors are taxed on more jobs, Amazon, Soft Bank, Exxon, IBM, have been packing in jobs and tackling those GM, Ford, and Chrysler all done so as well. More jobs in the United States of America.</p><p>We are moving to the golf game right now. We know that yesterday was the U.S. Open. We saw that Koepka wins it all. And so who is going to sponsor? Back in 2012, he went pro. He was a titlist guy in 2016, got an offer from Nike but then Nike, ducking out of sports equipment and just putting efforts in golf shoes and clothing. You can see Nike looking to upside. But we will see whether or not Adidas will try to woo him 100 percent just like Tiger Woods used those Taylor-made clubs. The three- wood, the driver, so it's the battle of the all the golf stocks together. We are watching those closely, everything from Under Armor, Nike, Callaway, just to name a few.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nicole, thank you. We want to look at Nike. What do you think? This is a good news story for Nike, Mike Murphy, after you know, the company, of course, announced cuts last week. But now you have the sponsor winner at the U.S. Open.</p><p>MURPHY: It is tough for this to move the needle for Nike that much. But it is a positive. It helps him move past one big golf personality who is kind of in some trouble right now. I think the young guns on PGA Tour are awesome. They're elevating the game. So many different people can step up on any given so I think that is a positive for Nike and golf in general.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about the young guns within technology, rotation going on right now. The last couple months, tech underperformed. First, you saw huge outperformance since election under performances, now we see Amazon up this morning. A big move in Amazon, money is moving into tech but it's also -- what about financials? Is there a rotation going on?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. I think a rotation out of the market. A lot of big tech names have sold off since the highs in early June about a week and a half ago. So you look at Netflix down almost 10 percent. Remember, Apple, which could do nothing wrong, received two downgrades, that sold off about six percent. Then Amazon news comes out and money starts coming back into tech sector. This is the one area you are going to still see growth. You look at Amazon, Apple, Facebook that is where the growth is. So a lot of money is going to continue to go there. I am looking at financials, though because I think we need financials to get the market. It's next leg up. You have the Fed raise interest rates last week, I think that is going to be a boost for the big banks and you should see those start to move next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So are you seeing when you saw money come out of tech did it go in financials? Was that rotation -- has that rotation begun?</p><p>MURPHY: A lot of -- not necessarily a lot of the money out of tech went into some big industrial names. So that's why so saw the Dow hold up the Dow 30 help up so much better than the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ got hit hard as the money came out of there but I think, money is going to go back looking for growth and it's going to go back and again you see the NASDAQ hitting new highs.</p><p>BAKER: Well see how -- the thing -- a person out there that doesn't really spend all day following the markets what should they be paying attention, what's keeping that could have a drag on the market?</p><p>MURPHY: I think really it's Washington, I think that would be the biggest problem I would see because earnings right now might support the market where it is. So as long as the companies can continue to grow, without any sort of major hiccup out of Washington I think you have a market that can go five to 10 percent higher this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Profits were up 15 percent in the first quarter. That's a good backdrop; take a break when we come back, Cars 3 cruising to the top of the box office this weekend. The kid-friendly sequel blast past Wonder Woman in the opening weekend. We're taking a closer look at the numbers, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: More than 60 people have been killed by raging forest fires in central Portugal. Cheryl Casone on this story now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Well so Maria, the death toll expected to rise as firefighters battle six major blazes officials say at least half of those killed were found dead in their vehicle. Others were found near a road that road golf with flames and smoke after these folks tried to escape their burning homes. Fire officials say the cause of blaze appears to be lightning strikes that happened back on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Well, Jeff Bezos is closing in on Bill Gates a recent surge in Amazon's stock has made Bezos almost $2 billion richer that's got him now just five billion away from overtaking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world. Bezos now worth about $84.6 billion here is the stock, it actually surged 21/2 percent Friday, as to company announced their buying whole foods, stocks getting more ground this morning which I say ahead of the opening bell 0f 79 percent in the premarket.</p><p>And then finally this Cars 3 won the race for top of the weekend box office. Yes, so the third installment of the franchise despite they're one of the lowest openings ever for a Pixar release we should say that the franchise took pole position of got more funds they're running out of time anyway their about $53.5 million. Now Wonder Woman they go into second place $40.8 million but she is still the superhero of the entire summer box office so far, she has earned now $274 million, at home 500 million overseas, not to be outdone. OK, in third plays, bit of a surprise here to analysts All Eyes on Me. It's a story of a rapper Tupac Shakur brought in 27 million that was a big surprise actually and their rounding out the top the five this week The Mummy and 47 Meters Down. So girl power continuing to be in power in charge at the box office I will send it back to you, I've got more but I'm out of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I loved it; I actually did go see Wonder Woman.</p><p>CASONE: You did? And what would you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Girl power all the way. I didn't know the story of when she was young before she became Wonder Woman, thank you, Cheryl. The technology sector driving the game this morning Amazon shares adding to Friday gains we're looking at tech Michael Murphy would you put new money to work in Amazon on this whole food acquisitions?</p><p>MURPHY: No. I wouldn't, and the reason Maria, it's such a big run up; it's up almost 40 percent year-to-date. So go against the trend probably but I would look more at an old school, not really tech name but I think Walmart which is up about 10 percent this year, has some catching up to do against in Amazon, they purchased Jet.com, so I think there's more upside there in Walmart than there is at Amazon at a thousand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Going to talk about foreign policy with you Michael, going to talk about messaging with you later, we'll take short break final thoughts from our all-star panel next</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Welcome back to final thoughts from this all-star panel, Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, keeping an eye on Syria. I know there's a lot going on elsewhere but watch what's happening in Syria; it's going to be very important in terms of this conflict between us and the Russians. One last thing, if I could say a day late, but Happy Father's Day to everybody. My father passed away a few years back I think about him everyday best man I'll ever know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for that it's true, happy father's day and that is a really beautiful sentiment. Michael Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY: A tough act to follow. I agree, happy father's day to everybody and I think the first -- blue apron ideal coming out lot of venture IPO's coming this year it's going to be good for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think it does well?</p><p>MURPHY: I think it does.</p><p>CARTER: You have a consistent anti-message and attack message as Kellyanne put it. I really want to see the Republicans seize this moment where people are looking for unity and looking for us to move forward. It's time, let's do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow with another big show, Lee Carter, Michael Murphy, Mike Baker thank you so much for joining us this morning. As requested, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on deck.

Once stable democratic nation states made great through struggle and suffering to gain comparative freedom at huge sacrifice to their own population are throwing it all away. The speed and ferocity of the attack is frightening, but this has been building for years, spreading from the 60s onwards through the university teaching systems, unquestioned. </p><p>It emerged into the public arena as political correctness as each generation of students became more radical. Then came the final push to silence opposition with wokism, virtue-signalling, identity politics, and now racial division, an aberration of democracy and freedom of speech. The Trump presidency has been under a continual coup, even before taking office. Involvement from the top down of Obama and his administration and security services is an inconvenience for the Democrats, and many Republicans feel the same. What it does show, is that at this moment in the history of the United States, the deep state are above the law. We are waiting for Attorney General Barr to prove otherwise, but since he has already stated it is unlikely that Obama or Biden will be called to testify, he has issued a free pass, move along, nothing to see. All is swept aside on a media tide of attacks on democracy and the rule of law by the radical left, as BLM take control and politicians scamper down rabbit holes trying to avoid the buckshot. Those who control the media control the narrative, never more true than it is today, as truth becomes fiction and fiction fact. History is no longer the 'right' history, facts are no longer facts but interpretations. Our language is corrupted by thought-speak and 'wrong-thinking'. Intersectionality seeps through to the subconscious of the people as they are dissected, examined and re-assembled from parts into a whole, as independent thought lies discarded on the slab. The monster of BLM has screamed into the world, its children intent on destroying everything that will not acknowledge them, blind, unreasoning, malicious, merciless, they search for the meaning of their own existence and find nothing but their own image staring back from an iPhone. We are at the turning point. All opposition is being de-platformed, demonetised and silenced by the tyranny of the social media monopolies of Google, Facebook, Twitter, in the great lurch left to totalitarianism. Our language has been acquired, repossessed and annexed, a grand and despicable M&amp;#38;A, dismembered, rendered useless and sold off to the corporates and big tech. They are laying off the workforce whom they consider obsolete and no longer useful for their purposes. The world has turned on its dark side, an unrecognisable corruption of reality. Boris Johnson is presiding over a shift into anarchy. The Labour party cannot win through the ballot box, the BLM are useful to them. The radical left have co-opted and subjugated the old left, they are one and the same, because disorder and destruction are their only route to power, and they are taking it. As temperatures rise and unrest spreads, London is braced for another week of anarchy. A combination of Covid-19 restrictions, a hands-off police policy, and subsequent breakdown of law and order follows years of devolution of police enforcement powers to local authorities, and pushes London towards breakdown. Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, has announced funding cuts to an already undermanned and demoralised front line police force of 110 million over the next 2 years, #BLM defund the police. The country is undergoing a communist insurrection, a cultural marxist revolution indulged and endorsed by the elites. Far left racial divisionists and mainstream media incite violence, pushing the marxist agenda, whilst the rest of the population is so punch- drunk with the speed of the takeover, it does not even recognise that it is about to hit the canvas. THE TYRANNY OF BLM BLM is a marketing exercise by the three founders, all trained radical Marxists. Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors. The public have been played. No sympathy there. If you put your name or your money to a cause, the least you can do is look it up and see what you are supporting and find out what is behind the hype. Follow the money. There is bet-hedging from 'left-light' political commentators who are afraid to declare the emperor has no clothes. They advocate that it is not BLM and the rise of cultural marxism that we should be worried about, but the rise of the far-right in reaction to it. The far-right, or simply put, anyone who sees BLM for what they are, a cultural marxist totalitarian power-grab, are not the ones that require people to kneel before them, pull down and deface statues, injure police, the public and public property. BLM are the ones inciting riots through racial division, bullying small children, calling to abolish the police, and end capitalism and the family. It is time to get off the bench and stop trying to play both sides of the field. It is cowardly and will end in your own demise as all is swept aside by the mob. Come the revolution, and it is coming, you want to know who will hold the line with you and who will run, so best to find out now. BULLY At a party in Harrow Road London this week, police were pelted with objects and prevented from entering the area by youths shouting'you're not coming in' The police released a statement: 'Following engagement within the local community we are hopeful that crowds are dispersing.' A quick look on Google translate will tell you this means - 'they threw stuff at us, so we left' The message is, don't bother to call the council or the police, your neighbourhood is now run by youth mobs. The hardest hit by this lawlessness are in the poorest communities, in the council blocks, the housing association accommodation. The gentrified can sell up and ship out with their kids, the same kids advocating and encouraging the cultural revolution and racial division that is destroying London. The same kids that will be the politicians of tomorrow. Local authorities have the power to issue ASBOs (Anti-Social Behaviour Orders) noise abatement orders, and to seize equipment, but in most instances do not have the manpower or the resources to do so. They are the front line community police for out of control raves and parties, and they are the ones that engage with the local community and youth offenders and understand what is happening on the ground. Most no longer operate 'out of hour services' which is a nonsense, since that is exactly the time they are needed. All that can be done is for a complaint to be lodged after the fact. The police rarely engage with locals, instead they have a faceless, distant, centralised Met police call centre. Parliament have made mass gatherings and peaceful protests unlawful for the moment, but there is an exception. Northumbria police issued this statement yesterday: 'We'll be in attendance to facilitate a planned Black Lives Matter vigil at Keel Square in #Sunderland tonight. A Section 14 order is in place forbidding any other public assembly, including counter-protests, to ensure the public's safety.' - Northumbria Police This was echoed yesterday in London as more subsets of BLM demonstrators were allowed into central London in a Black Trans Lives Matter rally. Thousands of activists marched through central London in place of Pride celebrations that had been cancelled due to Covid-19 health fears. Banners of'White silence is violence' wereheld above the crowd, and a sign outside Parliament defaced, crossing out'Parliament' and replacing it with'racists'.The law is no longer applied equally. Radical left marxists running BLM take over the centre of London each weekend and grow emboldened, realising the law does not apply to them. London 16 Jun 2020: 'MPs have unanimously approved the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations 2020. This new law bans mass gatherings in London in a fight to stop the spread of the deadly virus' In Westminster, the government in their elite London bubble, seem unwilling to admit to the sense of unease amongst the public as law-abiding citizens are beginning to wonder if they even cares, They know that Sadiq Khan is intent on causing as much pain as he can to the population of London. It is likely the police will abandon the streets if a serious riot breaks out. Londoners see this as a real possibility, it has happened before. The last sustained rioting across London was sparked by the death of Mark Duggan in 2011. This saw disaffected youths vandalising property, looting, and assaulting people. Police were unable to respond to the speed of the rioting or to the numbers on the streets. The disorder spread to other parts of the UK and showed the power of social media to ignite and inflame tensions. An astonishing 3,000 people were arrested and 1,000 criminal charges brought for various crimes related to the riots. It was anarchy. There were 5 deaths and 16 injured as a direct result. These riots are still fresh in the mind due to their speed and ferocity and the opportunistic and senseless nature of the crimes committed. The same atmosphere is building, this time based on the BLM righteous rage and racial division agenda. If the police cannot shut down a party, they cannot contain a riot. The BLM construct lights a fire under race relations, deliberately so. The law-abiding citizen is unprotected and demonised. It is woke politics on steroids. 'Developing and delivering training, police monitoring and strategies for the abolition of police.' - gofundmeUK BLM BLM has seeped into all aspects of our lives, online, onto the streets and into the language. It is a very aggressive form of indoctrination and advertising, it is impossible to get away from on any media platform, television, radio, advertising and is being relentlessly pushed by corporates. The premise is, if you are white you are a racist. BLM is controlling the news narrative. The British and American public are under attack by a cult largely endorsed by their governments who, instead of defending the people that voted them into power, take the side of the mob. We are living through a transition to totalitarianism. The attacks are coming in waves, each wave growing in intensity, consuming and feeding off the last. They carry with them the worst disruptors of society of which there are many. They are active at demonstrations, as trained jihadists infiltrate and disrupt alongside Antifa and BLM activists. In America, heavily armed populist militia groups are growing and forming a coalition with the police, preparing for the fight-back. In the UK, there is no second amendment right to bear arms, so citizens are at the mercy of government policy. The police and government are working against their own people, the only way to fight back is to move out and find relative safety, this is what is happening in London. Left wing councils all over the UK are forcing agreement to marxist agenda. This is a battle between the people vs the elite political class. There is deep suspicion of all that they represent, government, corporate, education, media, church, all seem designed to silence those they claim to represent and to further their own, centralised globalist ideology. BLM are just another branch of this elite. This is Groundhog Day, the same argument that was played out after the Brexit referendum, that democracy does not matter, this is just the next battle in a far more extreme, pervasive and corrupt form. This is a race war incited by woke identity politics, facilitated by middle class white malcontents and snowflakes, overindulged by their parents and allowed to continue tantrums far beyond their teens, encouraged and enabled by neoliberal university educators and group-think on social media. It is an assault on the soul of nations, aided by domestic terrorists with the blessing of big government. It is the opposite of the spirit of Brexit, the opposite of independent thought. It is against the rule of law, the constitution, it is the destruction of the West by a decadent and controlling elite completely out of touch with its own people. On television, white primary school kids are humiliated and confused as they are asked to explain their white privilege. This is the ultimate endorsement of bullying by a political elite. BLM have ignited a race war, it is being played out in schools, on the streets and in the political arena, we are being told we must 'see colour', to actively encourage division by colour. There is no room for discussion or debate with this hypersensitive Facebook generation who are incapable of having an opinion unless it is 'liked' by consensus. Racial profiling is being endorsed across all mainstream media platforms. Both Britain and America have governments that are weak and vulnerable, both countries are ripe for the taking. Shaun King could not have staged this uprising more skilfully, no doubt he has a strong hand in this and directs from his throne at Harvard Law School. Sadiq Khan and Cressida Dick do his bidding. Norman Brennan, Director of the Law and Order Foundation, on Talk Radio London said of the anarchy in Britain: 'We are barely able to police everyday issues. We have lost 22,000 officers, 4,000 of them in the Met. Just look how that has depleted backing up their own colleagues dealing with any public disorders that we are beginning to see on our streets, almost daily now. It's embarrassing, I feel for my colleagues. In thirty-one years of policing I can' t recall a single time that I ran away from an incident. A). I knew I would be getting back-up and B). we had this sort of fearlessness amongst us that the criminal element were not allowed to run riot, they were not allowed to rule the streets. That's our job, and we rule the streets on behalf of society. What the Commissioner does {Cressida Dick}, and she does it all the time, is to close it down, you can see her political stance. What public order incident that breaks out on the streets, most probably in London, is going to ignite wide scale public disorder throughout Britain? It takes one. At this moment in time, it's like a litmus paper. Which incident is going to light it?' BLM can only feel encouraged, just like a spoilt child testing how far they can go until the adult in the room says, no more. The problem is, there are no adults in the room. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel are full of platitudes, but they do nothing. This is no longer a Conservative party that are strong on public order, this is a Conservative Party far left of Tony Blair. A party out of touch with its core voters, so much so that all it can do is steal the ideas from another party to win an election, as it did from Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party in 2019. It seems to think that to deliver on Brexit is enough, but this terrible unease that has come over the country is at boiling point, as the law-abiding citizen is chastised and knocked back into silence again and again. In London, you can feel the tension on the ground, simmering, mostly unsaid, but it is there. The elites in the London bubble don't see this, and so it festers. They have no sense of place, only a sense of self. For them it is an experiment in socialism, for the public it is a crisis. When a country has to take up arms to protect itself, will such a diversity of communities, such disparity in wealth, of ideas, of religions, be able to come together to defeat the enemy? Will it even be able to identify who that enemy is when the government and their agencies, so contemptuous of the public, and yet so naive themselves, cannot. That question will be answered soon. The public will get no help, the elites have chosen to go to war against their own people. They have taken to a serpent to their bosom, an insidious viper that is sowing the seeds of racial unrest. It is a construct by forces wishing to subvert and cause pain and to take power over those already weak and demoralised from Covid-19. A woke, cultural revolution of media and government institutions against all that the British public hold dear. 'I believe that the mainstream media in Britain are stoking and inciting people to be disorderly on the streets of Britain. It's almost as though they would love it if there were wide-scale public disorder.' - Norman Brennan More than this, it is the aim of BLM, Antifa and the increasingly marxist socialist left, many of whom preside in Westminster, to cause exactly that. The public are at this very moment being beaten into submission. Anyone who lives in London becomes streetwise very fast, and stories of citizens being marched to an ATM at knife point are common. These are not petty crimes. In one of the largest local authorities in London run by a Labour council for many years, their crime enforcement team has been reduced to 4 for a population of approx 324,000. The need by government to reduce perceived crime has led to such madness. This hollows out the middle class who are moving away from London as they feel it is no longer a safe place to live or raise children. Judging from the battles in some of the most gentrified and highly-priced boroughs in London, they are right. Whilst most citizens are still under restrictions in 'bubbles' of social contact, others are totally immune to either enforcement or prosecution. Priti Patel talks tough but if she were serious, she would fire Cressida Dick. Alongside Sadiq Kahn, the marxist agitator who despises his own country, they are killing London, without law and order on the streets, and law and order applied equally, there is nothing. They are poisonous. This overtly racist tribalist drive to divide the cities is yet another realignment of the elites. Those outside the London bubble indoctrination zone are not buying into any of this and grow more sceptical by the day. This is a choice. You chose civilisation, free speech, the constitution and the rule of law, you defend it vociferously, or you let it all crumble to dust and be taken over by the radical left, who will have power over you until death.

That explains why Uber\u2019s first public move after Transport for London (TfL) revoked its private hire licence on 22 September was to start a change.org petition \u2013 ordinarily the recourse of the otherwise impotent. \u201cSave your Uber in London,\u201d it declared, as though it were a local library imperilled by austerity, not a global business worth $60bn.</p><p>  Some 787,000 people have signed that petition. Right-wing commentators in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spectator</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daily Mail</emphasis> accused TfL and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, of protectionism, while even many on the left bemoaned the potential loss of a cheap ride. This was the reaction for an operator that the regulator declared was not \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a licence. In the years preceding the financial crisis, banks became too big to fail. Now Silicon Valley has given us tech firms too popular to proscribe.</p><p>  This has injected arrogance into Uber\u2019s corporate culture. It took the new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2013 perhaps struggling to locate contrition on his emotional map \u2013 three days to apologise. He accepted that Uber had made \u201cmistakes\u201d in London but, behind the scenes, the firm was accusing transport officials of not giving it a chance to fix its problems.</p><p>  Uber\u2019s attraction lies in the cost (it\u2019s usually much cheaper than a black cab) and the convenience. It stopped the rush for the last train at parties; it brought innovation and competition to the market; in 2015, it introduced UberPool, which enables passengers to share cars with strangers \u2013 a cheaper, greener journey than a taxi ride. It has also encouraged black cabs to improve their service. More now accept card payments since Uber eliminated the need to carry cash.</p><p>  But Uber has long flouted the rules. It is currently acting as though it were the owner of a restaurant that the food standards inspector closed after finding a lone rat in the kitchen. That is disingenuous. In May, Uber was given only a four-month extension on its licence to operate after a series of controversies about its working practices. There were a lot of rats in that kitchen.</p><p>  At the Labour party conference in Brighton, the Ilford North MP, Wes Streeting, told me that Uber had adopted an \u201costrich strategy, pretending everything was fine\u201d. A mayoral aide added that the company\u2019s usual approach \u2013 now softened by the removal of its licence \u2013 was an \u201caggressive combination of refusing to talk to TfL when asked for information and demanding TfL go through lawyers\u201d.</p><p>  The worst of the company\u2019s alleged sins emerged in a letter written in April, in which the Met claimed that Uber had failed to handle criminal complaints adequately. Examples included a \u201croad-rage\u201d incident, in which a driver allegedly pulled out pepper spray during an altercation with another motorist, and sexual assaults. The police accused Uber of allowing a driver who had sexually assaulted a passenger to stay on the company\u2019s books, leading to an attack on another woman. The transport authority also raised concerns about Uber\u2019s possible use of \u201cGreyball\u201d \u2013 software that it had employed in the US to thwart government regulators (the firm denies that it has been used for that reason here).</p><p>  There are other grounds to criticise the company. Uber refused to classify its drivers as employees \u2013 denying them the workplace protection that most people enjoy. A report by the Labour MP Frank Field accused Uber of treating its drivers as \u201csweated labour\u201d and claimed that some took home less than the minimum wage. Its policy of allowing passengers to rate drivers on a five-star scale \u2013 if they slip too low, they can be deactivated \u2013 is so pernicious that Charlie Brooker extrapolated it for an episode of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Mirror</emphasis>.</p><p>  Then there\u2019s the masterclass in misogyny that its corporate culture offers. Susan Fowler, an engineer who worked for Uber in California, wrote an account of the sexual harassment and discrimination she suffered there that was so damning that the resulting investigation led 20 staff to be sacked. Other female employees later came forward, putting pressure on the then CEO, Travis Kalanick, to resign. The company then provided the headline of the year, in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>: \u201cUber\u2019s search for a female CEO has been narrowed down to three men\u201d.</p><p>  And yet 3.5 million Londoners use Uber. During the 2016 presidential election campaign, Donald Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and he wouldn\u2019t lose any voters. Uber seems like his corporate equivalent \u2013 what would it have to do to lose significant support?</p><p>  What\u2019s strange is that some of those who use Uber are the type of people who buy fair-trade bananas and criticise tax-avoiding companies. They feel entitled to cheap cabs in the same way that people buy sweat-shop clothes unquestioningly. Perhaps some customers have also been misled about what sparked the current battle with TfL. Uber has framed this as an attack on the app. It isn\u2019t. The app is run by a separate, Netherlands-based company; TfL\u2019s fight is with Uber London, which dispatches the cars. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think that there\u2019s a vital role for regulation in ensuring passenger safety.</p><p>  I imagine that TfL and Uber will eventually reach a deal. Sadiq Khan will push for this, aware that so many of his voters are Uber customers. Yet the controversy surrounding the company is unlikely to disappear. Uber\u2019s pricing model is unsustainable. It is running up huge losses \u2013 $645m in the second quarter of this year \u2013 that help it offer the cheap fares that endanger its rivals. Prices will eventually have to rise. When they do, even Uber loyalists may feel that they\u2019ve been taken for a ride.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKC-YRV1-DYX2-C55R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 New Statesman Ltd.

On sent comme un petit vent de panique sur les hauteurs de Davos (Suisse). L'\u00e9conomie mondiale arepris des couleurs, les barons de la finance rel\u00e8vent la t\u00eate, <person><nameText>Mario Draghi, </nameText></person>le patron de la Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne (BCE), ne vient m\u00eame plus dispenser ses sages sentences pour rassurer les march\u00e9s sur l'\u00e9tat de l'euro - la monnaie unique va bien, merci. Mais quel est donc ce malaise insidieux qui vient troubler la f\u00eate?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certains l'ont baptis\u00e9, en anglais, le techlash, contraction du mot backlash, ou retour de b\u00e2ton, et de technologie, puisque c'est elle la cible. Pas toute la technologie, bien s\u00fbr. Ceux qui sont sur la sellette depuis un peu plus d'un an, ce sont les g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains de l'Internet, les \u00abBig Tech\u00bb, ceux que l'on surnomme GAFA en France (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) et, depuis peu, les FANG en anglais (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).</p><p>Longtemps, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les chouchous de Davos, o\u00f9 \u00e9taient mises en valeur les promesses infinies qu'offraient leurs innovations pour le bienfait de l'humanit\u00e9, sans parler des niveaux mirobolants atteints par leur capitalisation boursi\u00e8re. Ces deux ou trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les interrogations suscit\u00e9es par l'impact de l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration des avanc\u00e9es technologiques sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et le monde du travail se sont faites un peu plus pressantes dans les d\u00e9bats du Forum \u00e9conomique mondial.</p><p> Algorithmes malfaisants et \u00abfake news\u00bb </p><p>Mais aujourd'hui, les Big Tech se retrouvent carr\u00e9ment en position d'accus\u00e9s. Sur la fiscalit\u00e9, l'utilisation des donn\u00e9es personnelles, l'obsolescence programm\u00e9e des produits, les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d'addiction dont les dirigeants de la Silicon Valley prennent soin de pr\u00e9server leurs enfants tout en les encourageant dans le reste du monde, les algorithmes malfaisants, l'exploitation des contenus des m\u00e9dias traditionnels, les critiques ne cessent de pleuvoir.</p><p>Ajoutez \u00e0 ces maux ceux des \u00abfake news\u00bb et des interf\u00e9rences venues de Russie dans les campagnes \u00e9lectorales occidentales par le biais des r\u00e9seaux sociaux, et vous avez des responsables de GAFA qui commencent \u00e0 s'offusquer s\u00e9rieusement qu'on les rende quasiment coupables de l'\u00e9lection de Donald Trump.</p><p>Alors \u00e0 Davos, ils serrent les rangs, clairement sur la d\u00e9fensive. Avec des strat\u00e9gies diff\u00e9rentes, qui impliquent souvent des r\u00e9unions d'explication, ou de discussion, \u00aben petit comit\u00e9\u00bb, avec des experts, des journalistes - mais attention, strictement \u00aboff the record\u00bb.</p><p>Il y a ceux qui sont dans le d\u00e9ni, soulignant que \u00abce sont des questions compliqu\u00e9es\u00bb. Il y a ceux qui demandent aux Etats de s'impliquer davantage dans la bataille, eux qui d'habitude abhorrent la r\u00e9gulation. Il y a ceux qui jouent les vertueux, pr\u00eats \u00e0 encaisser toutes les critiques, pour montrer qu'ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 s'amender et \u00e0 assurer l'avant-garde du combat pour sauver la d\u00e9mocratie. Il y a ceux qui assurent \u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9s si loin dans l'autocritique que leurs camarades du secteur leur reprochent \u00abde se livrer \u00e0 autant d'autoflagellation\u00bb. Et puis il y a ceux qui masquent difficilement leur ras-le-bol d'\u00eatre ainsi tra\u00een\u00e9s dans la boue, de ces atteintes port\u00e9es \u00e0 leur honneur de champions de l'innovation, cr\u00e9ateurs de lien social.</p><p> \u00abMoment Frankenstein\u00bb </p><p>Pour ces entreprises habitu\u00e9es \u00e0 fasciner, \u00e0 pousser l'audace toujours plus loin et \u00e0 servir de mod\u00e8le au monde entier, ce d\u00e9samour est violent. Lorsque l'on demande \u00e0 un responsable si sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est pas confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00abmoment Frankenstein\u00bb, face \u00e0 une \u00e9norme invention qu'elle n'arrive plus \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler, il a un haut-le-coeur. \u00abNon, pas un moment Frankenstein, mais un moment o\u00f9 nous devons r\u00e9tablir un \u00e9quilibre\u00bb, conc\u00e8de-t-il. Il n'y aura pas, pourtant, de remise en cause fondamentale: \u00abNous faisons des erreurs, mais le mod\u00e8le est le bon.\u00bb</p><p>Difficile, cependant, de ne pas sentir le vent du boulet. Le barom\u00e8tre annuel sur la confiance, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e par la firme Edelman et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouverture de Davos, r\u00e9v\u00e8le cette ann\u00e9e une baisse de la confiance dans les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et une remont\u00e9e de l'image des m\u00e9dias traditionnels dans plusieurs pays occidentaux. C'est une cons\u00e9quence \u00e9vidente des pol\u00e9miques de ces derniers mois.</p><p>Et que dire lorsque le premier ministre indien lui-m\u00eame, Narendra Modi, \u00e0 la t\u00eate d'un pays qui fournit des bataillons d'ing\u00e9nieurs \u00e0 la Silicon Valley, s'inqui\u00e8te des technologies \u00e0 double tranchant? \u00abLes transformations technologiques, a-t-il dit \u00e0 la tribune de Davos mardi, influencent profond\u00e9ment la mani\u00e8re dont nous vivons, pensons, et faisons de la politique. La technologie a le pouvoir de fa\u00e7onner, de briser, de lier\u00bb, en particulier avec les r\u00e9seaux sociaux.</p><p> Appel \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la transparence </p><p>Un peu plus tard mardi, au cours d'un d\u00e9bat sur la m\u00eame sc\u00e8ne, la patronne d'IBM, Ginni Rometty, lan\u00e7ait pour sa part un appel \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la transparence pour l'introduction des nouvelles technologies: \u00abIl faut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s clair, appliquer des principes sur les donn\u00e9es personnelles: le consommateur ou le client doit \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire de ses donn\u00e9es.\u00bb </p><p>Derni\u00e8re ignominie: les Etats-Unis viennent d'\u00eatre chass\u00e9s du top10 de l'index de <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/south-korea-tops-global-innovation-ranking-again-as-u-s-falls\">l'innovation \u00e9tabli chaque ann\u00e9e par l'agence Bloomberg,</url> o\u00f9 les trois premi\u00e8res places sont occup\u00e9es par la Cor\u00e9e du Sud, la Su\u00e8de et Singapour. Et qui a chass\u00e9 les Etats-Unis? La France, \u00e0 la neuvi\u00e8me place.</p><p>Les Big Tech ont pourtant tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 se ressaisir. Car, de leur propre aveu, la r\u00e9volution qui s'annonce, celle de l'intelligence artificielle, aura un tel impact sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle va \u00e0nouveau poser \u00abla question de la ma\u00eetrise de la technologie pour la mettre au service de l'humanit\u00e9\u00bb, selon l'expression du dirigeant de l'un des GAFA. En comparaison, l'\u00e9pisode des r\u00e9seaux sociaux appara\u00eetra comme une d\u00e9su\u00e8te partie de campagne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The major indices have a weak tone early on, but it's possible they could bounce around in low-volume trading with so much attention focused elsewhere. Despite Tuesday's early softness, the U.S. market appears to be on slightly better footing going into election day, with the S...00 (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) both closing higher in four of the last five sessions. While we're probably far from out of the woods, the selling pressure that kept coming in waves last month has died down a bit over the last week. </p><p>Yesterday saw super-light volume, and the same could hold true today. It seems unlikely that many investors would want to take big new positions with the election returns about to come in. One question as voting gets underway is how results might hit different sectors. This isn't a political column, but it can't be denied that the makeup of Congress sometimes has an impact on corporations and the markets. Some analysts have argued that the current administration and Congress, with their emphasis on de-regulation and tax cuts, might have helped some sectors, while the administration's tough stance on trade might have hurt others. Two sectors to consider watching Wednesday after results are known could be financials and biotech, because these two often tend to come under the Congressional microscope. Both sides of the aisle have targeted drug pricing, while past Democratic Congresses have tried to increase bank regulation. The industrial and materials sectors also might be worth a look as there's recently been a little renewed talk about Washington getting back into the infrastructure game. That was something that sparked interest in early 2017, after the last election, but fizzled over time. Investors might actually be able to start getting a sense of the market's reaction by later tonight if they feel like taking a look at the futures market after the first results start to roll in. However, it's unlikely that markets would start pricing any results in until after 7 p.m. ET or so.No Tech? No Problem!Monday's action might provide evidence that there can be a rally without much help from tech and communication services. Those sectors were two of just three to edge lower in the session, joined by consumer discretionary, the sector where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[1]) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA[2]) dwell. Both those stocks, like AAPL, came under pressure after their recent earnings reports. Also, some of the FAANGS might have taken a secondary punch Monday from talk out of the White House that the administration might be looking into what it said were possible antitrust violations by AMZN and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG[3]) (NASDAQ: GOOGL[4]). While a 3 percent drop in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL[5])\u2014still sputtering after a negative market reaction to earnings last week\u2014and a 2 percent drop in AMZN helped drag down tech and discretionary, a lot of other sectors showed firmness Monday. Energy, financials, staples, industrials, health care and even the beaten down materials stocks posted gains. Not all the techs and communication services (can we call them 'Comserves?') fell, either. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX[6]), IBM (NYSE: IBM[7]), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT[8]) were among the big names moving higher. What this might show is some resilience. As we noted last week, the October descent was pretty orderly, not characterized by huge panic. It looked like an asset repricing was underway, and some investors might have been searching for places to get back in. The recent more positive run doesn't mean the downturn is over. There could be challenges ahead, and volume being on the light side Monday argues against drawing any major conclusions. Volatility is back to more normal historic levels and likely to keep things rocky for some time, at least until there's some sort of cooling of the trade and Brexit worries. All that said, it's arguable that resilience could continue to show up. From a technical perspective, any close in the SPX above the 200-day moving average near 2765 would probably be viewed as a positive sign, while support now seems to rest near the psychological 2700 level. That's an area the SPX tested last last week but didn't close below. Sometimes a move like that can be a positive technical signal. Still, the SPX didn't manage to recover all of Friday's losses. That, along with the light volume, could argue against Monday's action being too big a win for the bulls, as one analyst noted on CNBC. In earnings action, Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY[9]) reported Q3 earnings per share of $1.39, four cents above third-party consensus of $1.35. Revenue of $6.06 billion compared with the consensus estimate of $6.1 billion. Shares of the company, which had risen more than 25 percent so far this year, barely budged after the results were posted. Analysts and investors are likely looking to hear an update on the company's cost-cutting measures. Checking the big picture on earnings, with about 75 percent of S...00 companies done reporting as of the end of last week, the percentage with EPS above estimates (78 percent) tops the five-year average, according to Factset. Also, 61 percent of reporting companies had sales above the five-year average. On a more negative note, the average S...PS estimate for Q4 fell by 1.1 percent during October, Factset said. That's the most it's fallen in the last three quarters, but a smaller decline than average for the first month of a quarter. The main data today is the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, due this morning. Eyes might turn toward Washington tomorrow as the Fed begins its two-day meeting, though chances of any rate hike are slim to none, judging by futures market action. Over in fixed income, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields continue to flirt with the 3.20 percent level early Tuesday, only a handful of basis points below last month's high.Big Tech Drew Some Interest in October, Data ShowThough tech had a down day Monday, the sector apparently found interest from some retail investors last month, according to the Investor Movement Index (IMXSM). The IMX measures what TD Ameritrade clients are actually doing and their exposure level to markets. Some of the big tech stocks attracting interest included AAPL and MSFT, along with AMZN, which sometimes gets bunched with tech despite being in consumer discretionary. At the same time, investors tracked by the IMX seemed to take a more bearish view of Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR[10]) and FB. Also missing from the 'buy list' in IMX last month was AT...nc. (NYSE: T[11]), while Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM[12]) saw selling interest among the investors tracked. There could be any number of reasons for retail investors to lose some interest in either of those stocks, but one possibility (given that some people tend to buy these two names in part for their dividends), is that maybe a few investors started to nibble at fixed income rather than seeking dividend yield. It could be an interesting trend to watch if it persists this month. In general, the October IMX appeared to show retail investors not far from the median stock exposure they've had over the last six months. It fell about 2 percent in October even as the market took a beating. This could indicate that many retail investors might be looking to weather the storm, and could reinforce ideas that there isn't necessarily panic in the market. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/u105576/2018-11-06-chart.jpg\">https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/u105576/2018-11-06-chart.jpg</url> FIGURE 1: Cheek-to-Cheek: This year-to-date chart comparing crude oil (candlestick) to the S...00 (purple line) shows the two trading in a more correlated way over the last two months after dancing on their own at times earlier in 2018. Misery loves company, the saying goes, and recent five-month lows in the SPX were followed shortly thereafter by seven-month lows in crude. This correlation could be a pattern worth tracking in months ahead, and keep in mind that winter tends to be a weaker time for the oil market, historically.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Crude BroodsAfter falling to seven-month lows last week, crude rebounded a bit early Monday before pulling back late despite new U.S. sanctions on Iran taking effect. One question raised by some analysts Monday is how long the current low prices\u2014which partly stem from production increases recently made by Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2014can last. For instance, the U.S. has granted waivers to some countries allowing them to buy Iranian oil, but on Monday issued a warning to China and India that there would be 'consequences' if they keep buying from Iran. If tensions rise, prices could start to feel the heat, however much crude Russia and Saudi Arabia pump out. Speaking of them, OPEC is scheduled to hold a meeting this weekend, so investors might want to consider checking headlines. Recently the Saudis have been talking about how they want to keep markets supplied in the absence of Iranian oil. But will they adopt a different tone at the meeting after the quick descent in U.S. crude from above $76 last month to under $63 by early Tuesday? That remains to be seen.P/Es Do Something They Haven't In a WhileFor the first time since last spring, the S...00's (SPX) forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is under the five-year average. As of early this week, the forward P/E\u2014which is based on analysts' predictions for S...00 earnings over the next 12 months\u2014stood at 15.6, according to Factset. That's below the five-year average of 16.4, but above the 10-year average of 14.5. The 10-year average, of course, includes the deep bear market of 2008/09, and figures from that era will soon be out of the equation, probably raising the 10-year P/E accordingly. The lower P/E recently comes as S...00 companies have reported a 24 percent average rise in earnings per share for Q3, so far. That's a huge number, but most analysts expect EPS growth to slow to below 10 percent in 2019, which probably helps explain some, though not all, of the market's recent challenges.Ghost of Midterms PastIt's never a good idea to think that past market action necessarily tells us something about the future, but big events like midterm elections sometimes can play into price direction in the following months. In 2014, the SPX had climbed nearly 10 percent over the six months heading into the November election, reaching 2000 for the first time. During the following six months, the SPX saw its pace of gains slow, but did climb another 3 percent. In 2010, the SPX entered November with solid gains of about 6.4 percent over the previous six months, and climbed another 11.7 percent by May 1. Things arguably are quite different this year, in part because the economy was still emerging from recession in 2010 and had more monetary policy support propping it up in 2014. Also, trade wars weren't raging. If a tighter lending environment and trade fears continue to be the big stories going forward, the election's long-term impact might not be end up being a big story\u2014however things turn out tonight.

Digital Content Next , a trade organisation representing the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and dozens of other media outlets and publishers (including yours truly, G/O Media), sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday asking if it was possible to renegotiate a better deal with the tech giant regarding its notoriously high commission rates for app developers. AKA what\u2019s infamously known as \u201cthe Apple tax.\u201d    As it stands, news outlets fork over 30 per cent of all revenue from first-time subscriptions made through iOS apps, with Apple\u2019s cut falling to 15 per cent after the first year should the reader continue their subscription, per the Wall Street Journal . A 30 per cent tax on an app\u2019s revenue is standard across the board on both Google and Apple\u2019s app stores, though the latter gets significantly more heat for this because of its walled garden (whereas Android\u2019s open ecosystem allows for multiple stores if app developers would rather not pay the toll).    \u201cThe terms of Apple\u2019s unique marketplace greatly impact the ability to continue to invest in high-quality, trusted news and entertainment particularly in competition with other larger firms,\u201d said the letter, which is signed by Digital Content Next\u2019s CEO, Jason Kint.    In the letter, Kint argues that Apple has previously made an exception to its usual 30 per cent rate for one preeminent customer in particular: Amazon . Emails between top Apple exec Eddy Cue and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that were revealed in an antitrust hearing last month showed that Amazon agreed to pay Apple just 15 per cent of its revenue from Amazon Prime Video subscriptions during its first year on the app store. Given this, Kint contends that Digital Content Next\u2019s news outlets and publishers should qualify for the same kind of modified terms Amazon was offered. At the very least, Apple needs to outline what conditions Amazon met to receive such a discount and afford other app developers the same opportunity.    \u201cThe monopolistic behaviour of big tech puts a wide range of industries \u2014 not the least of which is the news industry \u2014 at a distinct disadvantage,\u201d the group\u2019s SVP of government affairs, Chris Pedigo, wrote in a blog post Thursday. \u201cIt is laudable that EU and American regulatory bodies are digging in and uncovering these anti-competitive behaviours. Talking trust is not enough. We need to level the playing field and transparency is a critical first step.\u201d    Earlier this month, Epic Games filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google for removing its Fornite game from their respective app stores. In what was clearly an orchestrated antitrust trap , Epic added a way for players to make in-game purchases directly from its store in a recent update to both its iOS and Android apps. Since this circumvents Apple and Google\u2019s payment systems and, by extension, blocks them out of their cut of the sales, both companies banned Fortnite for violating store policies.    That started a domino effect that just seems to keep right on going. Epic responded with a ridiculously theatrical video raking Apple over the coals and pushed out a \u201cFree Fortnite\u201d hashtag to rally its player base against the tech giant. In turn, Apple hit back by promising to ban all of Epic\u2019s developer accounts and cut the company off from its iOS and Mac development tools by the end of the month.    Spotify and Tinder-owned Match Group later levied their own antitrust complaints against Apple. Then Facebook, ecstatic to not be the most-hated tech company for once, joined the fray and accused Apple of stifling small businesses with its steep commission prices.    It\u2019s starting to feel like an episode of Oprah at this point. But instead of giving out cars, it\u2019s \u201cYou challenge the Apple tax! You challenge the Apple tax! Everyone here challenges the Apple tax!\u201d    The post appeared first on Gizmodo Australia .

A reticent tech consumer and, until fairly recently, investor.</p><p>The Oracle of Omaha's conversion may be too late - there's rising concern that big tech stocks are now too hot to handle.</p><p>Buffett's investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, is one of Apple's largest shareholders, with 5.6 per cent of its stock, but it held off buying a stake until 2016, having traditionally shunned the sector.</p><p>For the rest of us, Faang stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google - typically dominate our portfolios, through direct investment or more often through funds with exposure to US markets.</p><p>It has been a savvy strategy for ten years, and in aggregate Faangs rose in value by 41 per cent last year. Apple had its best performance since 2009, rising more than 100 per cent in the year to January 2020. A single share at the beginning of this month would have cost you $298 (\u00a3231).</p><p>Facebook was up 51 per cent and the rest did well - Alphabet returned 26 per cent, Netflix 9 per cent, Amazon 19 per cent - but failed to beat the 33 per cent returns of their index, the Nasdaq. Of course, some of these have suffered from the sharp falls in recent days, dropping by about 15 per cent.</p><p>UK investors are still tech hungry in 2020. The sector took three spots on the January bestsellers list compiled by Interactive Investor, a fund platform; L&amp;G Global Technology Index Trust was fifth, Fidelity Global Technology was sixth and AXA Framlington Global Technology came ninth.</p><p>Shoehorning nothing but tech stocks into your \u00a320,000 Isa allowance in the hope that Faangs will not fail, would be a mistake, however.</p><p>Teodor Dilov, a fund analyst at Interactive Investor, says: \"Large cap technology names in the US have been the growth engine over recent years, so it's no surprise customers investing still seek to gain exposure to this theme.</p><p>\"However, it should be noted that current valuations are at historical highs. Investors should take extra care when reviewing their exposure.\" The rules of economic growth suggest that tech stocks' meteoric rise can't continue at the present pace.</p><p>Tech investors seem to think that results for next decade will be as good or better than those of the past ten years, says Brian Krawez, the president of Scharf Investments, a wealth manager, and that is a problem. \"That would require new waves of innovation and expansion to new industries, and a global customer base willing and able to buy in,\" he says.</p><p>\"History convincingly suggests few companies manage to defy economic gravity and old age with new businesses, much less all of the current favorites.\"</p><p>Other factors could knock big tech companies off the top rung of dominance. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/words-of-investment-wisdom-from-warren-buffett-0kbt6mnpb\">Disney</url></p><p>, Comcast, and others are coming to market with video services to rival Netflix. The US superstore giants Walmart and Target are fighting Amazon in e-commerce. Peer pressure is also meeting regulatory pressure.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, had to face the US Congress last year to </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/words-of-investment-wisdom-from-warren-buffett-0kbt6mnpb\">explain its nefarious involvement in the country's elections</url></p><p>. Across Europe, including in Britain, law-makers are pursuing antitrust rules and forcing tech companies to pay more tax.</p><p>Tech giants feature so heavily in UK fund managers' US funds, and popular market-return trackers, that share price falls could be amplified because of \"crowded trade\" risk - basically too many investors in Faang stocks for the same reason.</p><p>Sam Corbet, a fund manager at Ravenscroft, an investment platform, says one problem with Faangs today is they are hugely expensive.</p><p>\"We continue to believe the Faangs we own - Apple and Alphabet - possess characteristics we associate with quality business,\" he says. \"What has changed over the past 18 months is the price we are being asked to pay for such attributes.\"</p><p>Investors should pick \"cheap\" shares (relative to the intrinsic value of a company), in the hope prices will increase and make them big profits. Very high share prices make profits much less likely.</p><p>Corbet says: \"Eighteen months ago we believed Apple was undervalued. Since then the returns on offer have diminished, as the share price has grown significantly. Returns available for the risks we are being asked to take (which haven't changed) are not as attractive as they were.\"</p><p>                   The Faangs of the future                   </p><p>Isa investors who want to ride the tech wave long-term for less could try to seek out the Faangs of the future. Darius McDermott, the managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, a fund research company, says he likes smaller tech companies that have room to expand.</p><p>\"It is much easier to grow from a smaller base,\" he says. \"It's also important to remember the US is not the only place to find tech - Asian tech companies are strong.\"</p><p>The Jupiter Asian Income fund, for example, which has returned 21.7 per cent over the past three years, beating its sector, invests in northeast Asian tech firms that pay a dividend; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, Hon Hai, an electronics maker that gets half its revenues from Apple, and Media Tek, a chip design company.</p><p>Japan is strong in robotics. \"Its strength comes in high-precision component manufacturing,\" McDermott says. He points to the Baillie Gifford Japanese fund, which has returned 16.5 per cent in the past three years, bettering its sector by six percentage points. It invests in Fanuc and Yaskawa Electric - the world's biggest robotics companies - and SMC Corporation, which makes pneumatic valves for automation.</p><p>Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - the giant \"Bats\" - are China's equivalent to the Faangs. Baidu (China's Google) struggled with competition for advertising revenue last year, but Alibaba (similar to Amazon) shares jumped 66 per cent in the year from January 2019, and Tencent (games and messaging) adapted after a tough start to 2019.</p><p>\"There are a surprising amount of tech opportunities in Europe,\" McDermott says. \"Graham Clapp, the manager of RWC Continental European Equity, told us about ASML, one of his favourite companies over the past 20 years, a global leader in photolithography machines for making semiconductors.</p><p>\"The share price was volatile in the first decade.

A reticent tech consumer and, until fairly recently, investor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Oracle of Omaha's conversion may be too late - there's rising concern that big tech stocks are now too hot to handle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Buffett's investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, is one of Apple's largest shareholders, with 5.6 per cent of its stock, but it held off buying a stake until 2016, having traditionally shunned the sector.</p><p>For the rest of us, Faang stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google - typically dominate our portfolios, through direct investment or more often through funds with exposure to US markets.</p><p>It has been a savvy strategy for ten years, and in aggregate Faangs rose in value by 41 per cent last year. Apple had its best performance since 2009, rising more than 100 per cent in the year to January 2020. A single share at the beginning of this month would have cost you $298.</p><p>Facebook was up 51 per cent and the rest did well - Alphabet returned 26 per cent, Netflix 9 per cent, Amazon 19 per cent - but failed to beat the 33 per cent returns of their index, the Nasdaq.</p><p>Of course, some of these have suffered from the sharp falls in recent days, dropping by about 15 per <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cent.UK\">www.cent.UK</url> investors are still tech hungry in 2020. The sector took three spots on the January bestsellers list compiled by Interactive Investor, a fund platform; L&amp;G Global Technology Index Trust was fifth, Fidelity Global Technology was sixth and AXA Framlington Global Technology came ninth.</p><p>Shoehorning nothing but tech stocks into your \u00a320,000 Isa allowance in the hope that Faangs will not fail would be a mistake, however.</p><p>Teodor Dilov, a fund analyst at Interactive Investor, says: \"Large cap technology names in the US have been the growth engine over recent years, so it's no surprise customers investing still seek to gain exposure to this theme.</p><p>\"However, it should be noted that current valuations are at historical highs. Investors should take extra care when reviewing their exposure.\" The rules of economic growth suggest that tech stocks' meteoric rise can't continue at the present pace.</p><p>Tech investors seem to think that results for the next decade will be as good or better than those of the past ten years, says Brian Krawez, the president of Scharf Investments, a wealth manager, and that is a problem. \"That would require new waves of innovation and expansion to new industries, and a global customer base willing and able to buy in,\" he says.</p><p>\"History convincingly suggests few companies manage to defy economic gravity and old age with new businesses, much less all of the current favourites.\"</p><p>Other factors could knock big tech companies off the top rung of dominance. Disney, Comcast and others are coming to market with video services to rival Netflix. The US superstore giants Walmart and Target are fighting Amazon in e-commerce. Peer pressure is also meeting regulatory pressure. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, had to face the US Congress last year to explain the company's nefarious involvement in the country's elections. Across Europe, including in Britain, law-makers are pursuing antitrust rules and forcing tech companies to pay more tax.</p><p>Tech giants feature so heavily in UK fund managers' US funds, and popular market-return trackers, that share price falls could be amplified because of \"crowded trade\" risk - basically too many investors in Faang stocks for the same reason.</p><p>Sam Corbet, a fund manager at Ravenscroft, an investment platform, says one problem with Faangs today is they are hugely expensive.</p><p>\"We continue to believe the Faangs we own - Apple and Alphabet - possess characteristics we associate with quality business,\" he says.</p><p>\"What has changed over the past 18 months is the price we are being asked to pay for such attributes.\"</p><p>Investors should pick \"cheap\" shares (relative to the intrinsic value of a company), in the hope prices will increase and make them big profits. Very high share prices make profits much less likely.</p><p>Corbet says: \"Eighteen months ago we believed Apple was undervalued. Since then the returns on offer have diminished as the share price has grown significantly. Returns available for the risks we are being asked to take (which haven't changed) are not as attractive as they were.\"</p><p>The Faangs of the future Isa investors who want to ride the tech wave long-term Warren Buffett has swapped his flip-close Samsung phone, right, for an iPhone 11 for less could try to seek out the Faangs of the future. Darius McDermott, the managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, a fund research company, says he likes smaller tech companies that have room to expand.</p><p>\"It is much easier to grow from a smaller base,\" he says. \"It's also of the important to remember the US is not the only place to find tech - Asian tech companies are strong.\" The Jupiter Asian Income fund, for example, which has returned 21.7 per cent over the past three years, beating its sector, invests in northeast Asian tech firms that pay a dividend; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, Hon Hai, an electronics maker that gets half its revenues from Apple, and Media Tek, a chip design company.</p><p>Japan is strong in robotics. \"Its strength comes in high-precision component manufacturing,\" McDermott says.</p><p>He points to the Baillie Gifford Japanese fund, which has returned 16.5 per cent in the past three years, bettering its sector by six percentage points. It invests in Fanuc and Yaskawa Electric - the world's biggest robotics companies - and SMC Corporation, which makes pneumatic valves for automation.</p><p>Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - the giant \"Bats\" - are China's equivalent to the Faangs. Baidu (China's Google) struggled with competition for advertising revenue last year, but Alibaba (similar to Amazon) shares jumped 66 per cent in the year from January 2019, and Tencent (games and messaging) adapted after a tough start to 2019.</p><p>\"There are a surprising amount of tech opportunities in Europe,\" McDermott says. \"Graham Clapp, the manager of RWC Continental European Equity, told us about ASML, one of his favourite companies over the past 20 years, a global leader in photolithography machines for making semiconductors. The share price was volatile in the first decade. In the past decade it has really come good. Shares he bought for just under (EURO)20 are now worth (EURO)240. For me that really shows how a small company can grow.\"</p><p>100% rise in Apple's share price in the year to January 2020</p><p>108% rise in the value of Apple shares over the past five years</p><p>41% rise in the value of so-called Faang tech stocks last year</p><p>5.6% of Apple stock is owned by Warren Buffett's firm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Warren Buffett has swapped his flip-close Samsung phone, right, for an iPhone 11</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-158481556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFN-TRJ1-DYTY-C3YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 18, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002CUN</classCode><className>AXA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Smart finally comes homeSmart home devices have threatened to hit the mainstream for a couple of years now. But a series of developments towards the end of 2019 have set things up nicely for everything from cameras and door bells to lights and thermostats to get not only smarter, but also more compatible with each other. The smart home industry had been held back by the many different standards being introduced by each of the major players, which meant that devices from different brands didn't play nice with each other. </p><p>Now, industry biggies (and rivals) like Apple, Google and Amazon, along with the Zigbee Alliance, which counts Samsung, Ikea, Philips and others as its members, have partnered to develop an open-source platform - called Connected Home over IP - on which all future smart home devices will be built. So consumers will be free to buy the products that appeal to them the most, safe in the knowledge that inter-compatibility won't be an issue. From an Indian perspective, the country's leading smartphone brand, Xiaomi, and the fastest growing brand in 2019, Realme, have both highlighted smart home as a key focus category in 2020, meaning that India will soon have smart home products available widely and at attractive prices.?  Welcome your digital twinImagine a digital carbon copy of yourself residing somewhere in the cloud, growing and evolving as you do. The concept of AI-based digital twins isn't new - it has been used by NASA to test the safety of space missions and by manufacturing companies to verify the effectiveness of new products - but an exciting new avenue for the technology is healthcare. Collecting a wealth of data from a tiny wearable sensor, digital twins can contain all the unique physiological information that is unique to you. Doctors can then use this digital twin to test everything from new medication to organ transplants in a risk-free environment. Digital twins are also vital in another fastgrowing health-tech field - personalised dosage. With drugresistant illnesses on the rise, doctors are pushing to replace one-size-fits-all treatments with solutions that tackle diseases on an individual level, taking each person's unique chemistry and environmental factors into account. Digital twins will help create personalised treatments and medication plans that work effectively and with minimal side-effects.?  Privacy, but not from the authoritiesTech giants like Google and Facebook are feeling the heat as governments and regulators globally are drafting laws to rein in web and social media platforms and holding them accountable for data breaches, spread of disinformation, and user privacy. Following the lead of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India too has floated the Personal Data Protection Bill, which is aimed at giving individuals the ability to take back control of their personal data that is shared online, as well as ensuring that sensitive data of Indians is stored on servers within India. But while ensuring that our data isn't abused by Big Tech, the privacy bill also seeks to grant the government unfettered access to a variety of personal data of Indian citizens. It also includes open-ended provisions to ramp up such data collection, while allowing for government agencies and representatives to be excluded from such data collection. So while tech companies are being held more accountable for how they manage our data, they may also be arm-twisted into handing over that very data to the authorities. So in 2020, we will likely go from having our data monetised by multinational corporations to it being used by the government as a surveillance tool. Good bye, frying pan. Hello, fire.?  Spacious accommodationThey've been promising it for years, but in 2020, private space companies and NASA alike will have to put their money where their mouth is and finally usher in the era of space tourism, offering civilians a return trip into zero gravity and an out-ofthis-world view. Companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic already have lengthy waiting lists, despite a $250,000 deposit. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is also offering short sub-orbital trips for a similar ticket price. But it was NASA that really upped the ante when it announced that it will allow space tourists on-board the International Space Station for up to 30 days starting this year. A room in space won't come cheap though; space tourists will have to pay an eye-watering $35,000 per night, plus the cost of the flight to the space station on board a SpaceX or Boeing spacecraft, which in itself will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. As in the initial years of air travel, space tourism will only be feasible for the richest of the rich for the foreseeable future, but the industry is set to take its first giant leap in this direction this year.? Democratising gamingGaming is often derided as a rich man's hobby - more so in developing markets like India - and with good reason. The latest game consoles cost upwards of Rs 30,000, and high-end gaming PCs will set you back by about Rs 50,000. Add to that Rs 2,000 and more for each new blockbuster console or PC game, and you're looking at quite an expense. Cloud gaming wants to put an end to that. Just as the likes of Netflix changed how we consume films and TV, cloud gaming seeks to remove our dependence on expensive hardware and hefty game downloads. Like video streaming, cloud gaming services like Microsoft's Project xCloud - which is coming to India this year - only require a display device, a controller and a fast internet connection. The games run on powerful cloud servers, and the visual feed from the game is then relayed to your screen, and your controller inputs are streamed back to the server. The tech is still at a nascent stage and several teething issues exist, but with major tech and gaming companies getting behind streaming, 2020 will be the year when gaming goes the way of OTT video platforms, where all the latest blockbuster games are only a monthly subscription away.

Smart finally comes homeSmart home devices have threatened to hit the mainstream for a couple of years now. But a series of developments towards the end of 2019 have set things up nicely for everything from cameras and door bells to lights and thermostats to get not only smarter, but also more compatible with each other. The smart home industry had been held back by the many different standards being introduced by each of the major players, which meant that devices from different brands didn't play nice with each other. </p><p>Now, industry biggies (and rivals) like Apple, Google and Amazon, along with the Zigbee Alliance, which counts Samsung, Ikea, Philips and others as its members, have partnered to develop an open-source platform - called Connected Home over IP - on which all future smart home devices will be built. So consumers will be free to buy the products that appeal to them the most, safe in the knowledge that inter-compatibility won't be an issue. From an Indian perspective, the country's leading smartphone brand, Xiaomi, and the fastest growing brand in 2019, Realme, have both highlighted smart home as a key focus category in 2020, meaning that India will soon have smart home products available widely and at attractive prices.?  Welcome your digital twinImagine a digital carbon copy of yourself residing somewhere in the cloud, growing and evolving as you do. The concept of AI-based digital twins isn't new - it has been used by NASA to test the safety of space missions and by manufacturing companies to verify the effectiveness of new products - but an exciting new avenue for the technology is healthcare. Collecting a wealth of data from a tiny wearable sensor, digital twins can contain all the unique physiological information that is unique to you. Doctors can then use this digital twin to test everything from new medication to organ transplants in a risk-free environment. Digital twins are also vital in another fastgrowing health-tech field - personalised dosage. With drugresistant illnesses on the rise, doctors are pushing to replace one-size-fits-all treatments with solutions that tackle diseases on an individual level, taking each person's unique chemistry and environmental factors into account. Digital twins will help create personalised treatments and medication plans that work effectively and with minimal side-effects.?  Privacy, but not from the authoritiesTech giants like Google and Facebook are feeling the heat as governments and regulators globally are drafting laws to rein in web and social media platforms and holding them accountable for data breaches, spread of disinformation, and user privacy. Following the lead of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India too has floated the Personal Data Protection Bill, which is aimed at giving individuals the ability to take back control of their personal data that is shared online, as well as ensuring that sensitive data of Indians is stored on servers within India. But while ensuring that our data isn't abused by Big Tech, the privacy bill also seeks to grant the government unfettered access to a variety of personal data of Indian citizens. It also includes open-ended provisions to ramp up such data collection, while allowing for government agencies and representatives to be excluded from such data collection. So while tech companies are being held more accountable for how they manage our data, they may also be arm-twisted into handing over that very data to the authorities. So in 2020, we will likely go from having our data monetised by multinational corporations to it being used by the government as a surveillance tool. Good bye, frying pan. Hello, fire.?  Spacious accommodationThey've been promising it for years, but in 2020, private space companies and NASA alike will have to put their money where their mouth is and finally usher in the era of space tourism, offering civilians a return trip into zero gravity and an out-ofthis-world view. Companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic already have lengthy waiting lists, despite a $250,000 deposit. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is also offering short sub-orbital trips for a similar ticket price. But it was NASA that really upped the ante when it announced that it will allow space tourists on-board the International Space Station for up to 30 days starting this year. A room in space won't come cheap though; space tourists will have to pay an eye-watering $35,000 per night, plus the cost of the flight to the space station on board a SpaceX or Boeing spacecraft, which in itself will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. As in the initial years of air travel, space tourism will only be feasible for the richest of the rich for the foreseeable future, but the industry is set to take its first giant leap in this direction this year.? Democratising gamingGaming is often derided as a rich man's hobby - more so in developing markets like India - and with good reason. The latest game consoles cost upwards of Rs 30,000, and high-end gaming PCs will set you back by about Rs 50,000. Add to that Rs 2,000 and more for each new blockbuster console or PC game, and you're looking at quite an expense. Cloud gaming wants to put an end to that. Just as the likes of Netflix changed how we consume films and TV, cloud gaming seeks to remove our dependence on expensive hardware and hefty game downloads. Like video streaming, cloud gaming services like Microsoft's Project xCloud - which is coming to India this year - only require a display device, a controller and a fast internet connection. The games run on powerful cloud servers, and the visual feed from the game is then relayed to your screen, and your controller inputs are streamed back to the server. The tech is still at a nascent stage and several teething issues exist, but with major tech and gaming companies getting behind streaming, 2020 will be the year when gaming goes the way of OTT video platforms, where all the latest blockbuster games are only a monthly subscription away.

Smart finally comes homeSmart home devices have threatened to hit the mainstream for a couple of years now. But a series of developments towards the end of 2019 have set things up nicely for everything from cameras and door bells to lights and thermostats to get not only smarter, but also more compatible with each other. The smart home industry had been held back by the many different standards being introduced by each of the major players, which meant that devices from different brands didn't play nice with each other. </p><p>Now, industry biggies (and rivals) like Apple, Google and Amazon, along with the Zigbee Alliance, which counts Samsung, Ikea, Philips and others as its members, have partnered to develop an open-source platform - called Connected Home over IP - on which all future smart home devices will be built. So consumers will be free to buy the products that appeal to them the most, safe in the knowledge that inter-compatibility won't be an issue. From an Indian perspective, the country's leading smartphone brand, Xiaomi, and the fastest growing brand in 2019, Realme, have both highlighted smart home as a key focus category in 2020, meaning that India will soon have smart home products available widely and at attractive prices.?  Welcome your digital twinImagine a digital carbon copy of yourself residing somewhere in the cloud, growing and evolving as you do. The concept of AI-based digital twins isn't new - it has been used by NASA to test the safety of space missions and by manufacturing companies to verify the effectiveness of new products - but an exciting new avenue for the technology is healthcare. Collecting a wealth of data from a tiny wearable sensor, digital twins can contain all the unique physiological information that is unique to you. Doctors can then use this digital twin to test everything from new medication to organ transplants in a risk-free environment. Digital twins are also vital in another fastgrowing health-tech field - personalised dosage. With drugresistant illnesses on the rise, doctors are pushing to replace one-size-fits-all treatments with solutions that tackle diseases on an individual level, taking each person's unique chemistry and environmental factors into account. Digital twins will help create personalised treatments and medication plans that work effectively and with minimal side-effects.?  Privacy, but not from the authoritiesTech giants like Google and Facebook are feeling the heat as governments and regulators globally are drafting laws to rein in web and social media platforms and holding them accountable for data breaches, spread of disinformation, and user privacy. Following the lead of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India too has floated the Personal Data Protection Bill, which is aimed at giving individuals the ability to take back control of their personal data that is shared online, as well as ensuring that sensitive data of Indians is stored on servers within India. But while ensuring that our data isn't abused by Big Tech, the privacy bill also seeks to grant the government unfettered access to a variety of personal data of Indian citizens. It also includes open-ended provisions to ramp up such data collection, while allowing for government agencies and representatives to be excluded from such data collection. So while tech companies are being held more accountable for how they manage our data, they may also be arm-twisted into handing over that very data to the authorities. So in 2020, we will likely go from having our data monetised by multinational corporations to it being used by the government as a surveillance tool. Good bye, frying pan. Hello, fire.?  Spacious accommodationThey've been promising it for years, but in 2020, private space companies and NASA alike will have to put their money where their mouth is and finally usher in the era of space tourism, offering civilians a return trip into zero gravity and an out-ofthis-world view. Companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic already have lengthy waiting lists, despite a $250,000 deposit. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is also offering short sub-orbital trips for a similar ticket price. But it was NASA that really upped the ante when it announced that it will allow space tourists on-board the International Space Station for up to 30 days starting this year. A room in space won't come cheap though; space tourists will have to pay an eye-watering $35,000 per night, plus the cost of the flight to the space station on board a SpaceX or Boeing spacecraft, which in itself will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. As in the initial years of air travel, space tourism will only be feasible for the richest of the rich for the foreseeable future, but the industry is set to take its first giant leap in this direction this year.? Democratising gamingGaming is often derided as a rich man's hobby - more so in developing markets like India - and with good reason. The latest game consoles cost upwards of Rs 30,000, and high-end gaming PCs will set you back by about Rs 50,000. Add to that Rs 2,000 and more for each new blockbuster console or PC game, and you're looking at quite an expense. Cloud gaming wants to put an end to that. Just as the likes of Netflix changed how we consume films and TV, cloud gaming seeks to remove our dependence on expensive hardware and hefty game downloads. Like video streaming, cloud gaming services like Microsoft's Project xCloud - which is coming to India this year - only require a display device, a controller and a fast internet connection. The games run on powerful cloud servers, and the visual feed from the game is then relayed to your screen, and your controller inputs are streamed back to the server. The tech is still at a nascent stage and several teething issues exist, but with major tech and gaming companies getting behind streaming, 2020 will be the year when gaming goes the way of OTT video platforms, where all the latest blockbuster games are only a monthly subscription away.

Democrats will take over the House, meaning that President Trump will have to deal with a split government for the first time in his presidency. Will he be able to advance his agenda with that?</p><p>Let's discuss with Nia-Malika Henderson, David Gregory and John Avlon.</p><p>So listen, the conventional wisdom, Nia, is that, oh, well, there was gridlock in Washington, but President Trump actually got a lot of things that he wanted to passed. The Supreme Court picks. He got the regulations that he had promised. I mean, rolling back the regulations. The environmental things that he changed. So he was able to do a lot of it. Yes --</p><p>BERMAN: That was all with a pen. That was my -- that's the universal sign for the stroke of a pen.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I knew what that was. I thought that was Chuck Lewis.</p><p>BERMAN: Also conducting the orchestra.</p><p>CAMEROTA: But I mean, I guess my point is that, for people who say it was gridlock, I think that he thinks that he got -- made a lot of progress, regardless of how he did it.</p><p>NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, and one of the things I think he's been arguing and will continue to argue is that he's accomplished more in the first two years of his presidency than any other president before him. You'll have to do a reality check on that.</p><p>CAMEROTA: On the -- you probably --</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's false.</p><p>HENDERSON: So, yes, I mean, certainly the people who back him are very happy with what he's done with the Supreme Court. In some ways, the tax cut plan. Certainly, corporations are happy with that. I don't know if you're the average worker, if you've necessarily seen that in your paycheck.</p><p>But, yes, in terms of what -- what Republicans have wanted, he has provided them with a lot of check marks off of their to-do list.</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He has, but I think as you look into this new year, I think the most important relationship that has to do with the economy is what happens with China and working out this trade dispute and trade war with China. Both because what happens to China economically matters a great deal to us in the U.S. and our economy, because we're so linked. But this is a major area where the president witness to deliver, he campaigned on, he promised. And you look at his relationship with the Fed. He's already worked over Fed Chairman Powell over raising rates, so we keep an eye on how rates go this year and how the economy goes. But these relationships are going to be critical.</p><p>BERMAN: And China is another area where there is actually Democratic support --</p><p>GREGORY: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: -- for some of the things the president is doing, even if they don't say it vocally, even if they're not cheerleading. There are many --</p><p>GREGORY: Among Democrats who could challenge him in 2020, you know, in that industrial Midwest where they like the fight against China.</p><p>AVLON: And actually, the president deserves credit on China. I mean, something like North Korea, he's gotten all hot and heavy with his pen pal without actually seeing any progress on denuclearization.</p><p>But China, he's taken a very tough, hard line with some risks economically. Certainly, the trade war was a knock-on effect domestically and geopolitically.</p><p>But he's basically saying that this presidency is going to matter, that he's not going to let China get away with intellectual property theft the way it has with this kind of cyber hacking it has. And to try to sort of say this is the time to take a hard line to try to move China into being a more responsible actor on the world stage.</p><p>It's a tough line. It's high-risk, but he's had the guts to do it. And as you said, if he was simply focusing his fire on China and not attacking all our allies simultaneously, it might actually have a bigger bipartisan support than you might imagine.</p><p>HENDERSON: I think one of the things you wonder is did he overpromise in terms of what he said about renegotiating these trade deals? Obviously renegotiating NAFTA. It hasn't passed the House or the Senate yet. We'll see if that happens.</p><p>One of the things he promised was that renegotiating all those trade deals would mean all sorts of manufacturing, you know, coming back to the Midwest. All of those factories that closed down, he said they'd be humming. And that hasn't quite happened yet. You wonder. I mean, there's one thing to talk about sort of intellectual property, but if you're a manufacturing worker, I don't know that you necessarily are thinking about that.</p><p>AVLON: It's bigger than that. It's about China being an expansionist power that's promising wealth without liberty and trying to remake an entire region and possibly the whole world, and can the U.S. act as a check on that --</p><p>HENDERSON: Yes.</p><p>AVLON: -- while there's still time?</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK. So legislatively, things that he will not do unilaterally or can't, what do we think?</p><p>GREGORY: Well, to me the question mark is still around immigration. Because I think there's an obvious temptation for both parties not to solve it, to try to run on it in 2020.</p><p>The president, you know, had a big promise out there in 2016 to deliver. He wants to at least be seen fighting the good fight. And he's turned down wall funding in the past so that he could oppose what they call chain migration, allowing family members to come in.</p><p>I still think that's a big battleground. And there's no question that Republicans have wanted this off the table for -- for a decade or more. Democrats would like to be able to demonstrate they can show some progress. I just -- I just don't know.</p><p>BERMAN: There's going to be a lot of the House passing things that the Senate doesn't take up.</p><p>HENDERSON: That's right. That's right.</p><p>BERMAN: So, you know, you're going to have a lot of kabuki theater going on in Washington. And likewise, the Senate will be passing things that the House doesn't take up. And I don't know where interests overlap at all on a lot of this stuff except for infrastructure.</p><p>[07:10:13] AVLON: You know, Infrastructure Week, it's finally time. I'm not giving up on it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Let's start with Infrastructure Hour, which I feel like this is.</p><p>AVLON: Just -- you know.</p><p>BERMAN: Can I ask one thing about Russia, since we've managed to have a seven-minute discussion without mentioning Russia once?</p><p>The House, Democrats take over control of the House. They can now have hearings. This can be very public if they want it to be. They've said they want to bring in Michael Cohen to ask questions. Do you believe that over the next few months, we will see hours and hours of televised public testimony from some of the biggest stars of the Russia investigation over the last year?</p><p>HENDERSON: Yes, I think that's what we're going to see. You mentioned Michael Cohen. He seems to be eager to want to talk publicly, obviously did -- did some interviews. And so, yes, I think that is what we're going to see.</p><p>I think it's going to be riveting to watch because, remember, we saw a House Republican -- Republicans basically cede ground and essentially say, \"Oh, this isn't really something that we're interested in looking at.\" We sort of saw Devin Nunes, a figure who was basically running -- you know, running water for the White House. I think it's going to be a whole new ball game in terms of obstruction.</p><p>GREGORY: But along with that is the scrutiny on big tech. I mean, that's going to be a big story, too. It was a big story in 2018. And I think the screws keep tightening on tech companies and how they didn't do enough to ward off the Russian interference.</p><p>AVLON: And not just in that context, either. I mean, the real question is about the power they've accumulated, the amount of transparency and accountability that exists. And that may be a real theme.</p><p>I mean, you've seen Devin Nunes really blatantly, all of a sudden, say, \"It's time for a new era of transparency.\" A little late there, pal.</p><p>But -- but these things really do matter. And now you're going to have a check and balance in the House. And it will be fascinating to see it play out, because you're not going to be able to sort of weasel out of accountability in the same way folks have tried to do for partisan purposes over the past year.</p><p>CAMEROTA: In terms of investigations, I think it will be really fascinating to see what the line is for Democrats. So how much do they want -- obviously, their base is chomping at the bit for this. They certainly want to see the tax returns as soon as possible. All of the people called in, Michael Cohen, that is great reality TV for lots and lots of the Democratic base. But, of course, we know that it comes with a danger.</p><p>HENDERSON: Of just is the public sick of the Russia investigation? Do they feel like the Democrats might be beating a dead horse at this time? We'll see what happens.</p><p>GREGORY: Well, it's also that you have these figures who are going to run for president --</p><p>HENDERSON: Yes.</p><p>GREGORY: -- who will have some voice in this, who will say, you know, to the House leadership, \"Back it off.\" But they may feel a lot of pressure, too, in those early states among partisan activists to keep going.</p><p>AVLON: And remember, you know, there aren't super delegates this time around. I mean, you know, the question is how much some of the larger mandarins inside the Democratic Party are going to be able to put a -- pump the brakes when it comes to some of those impulses.</p><p>But remember: at the end of the day, the Russia investigation is about national security. It's about national priorities. It's not about partisan politics. So Mueller has been very careful about not playing that game. We'll see what the report is and judge it on its merits. But this is much bigger than partisan politics or winning a news cycle.</p><p>BERMAN: John, Nia, David, thank you all very much.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Thank you, guys.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy new year to you all.</p><p>AVLON: Happy new year.</p><p>BERMAN: We're going to start finding out which Democrats plan to challenge President Trump in 2020. A more interesting question might be which Democrats are not planning to challenge the president in 2020? Harry Enten and Chris Cillizza break down the contenders next.</p><p>[07:17:30] BERMAN: I'm just getting word now, it's New Year's Day 2019.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Happy new year.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy new year. That means the 2020 presidential election --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Has started.</p><p>BERMAN: It really has started. I'm supposed to say it's about to start in a serious way. It's been going on for months.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I've noticed.</p><p>BERMAN: It's been going on for a long time. So many important twists and turns already.</p><p>What you're going to see over the next few weeks is people officially enter the race, cast their names into the ring. They want to be the ones to challenge President Trump next -- next November? It's like November --</p><p>CAMEROTA: I don't know.</p><p>BERMAN: I can't do the math.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I can't, either.</p><p>BERMAN: The actually November election is still in 2020. But people are starting right now.</p><p>CAMEROTA: We're a long way away from it, I know that much, but not long enough for people not to throw their hats in the ring.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. So who's going to win? Let's bring in CNN Politics reporter and editor at large, Chris Cillizza; and CNN Politics senior writer and analyst, Harry Enten.</p><p>Let's skip to the end of this segment.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes, you know the answer.</p><p>BERMAN: Who's going to win?</p><p>HARRY ENTEN, CNN POLITICS SENIOR WRITER AND ANALYST: Look, I think that we don't know who's going to win. I think that that was the lesson of 2016. But we do have a number of candidates we think are in a prime position to take advantage of what seems to be the developing trends of the Democratic Party.</p><p>For instance, Kamala Harris, I think, is in a pretty decent position. Beto O'Rourke obviously. You know, Chris and I have been talking about him for months now, saying look at how he did in that Texas Senate race.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, OK, maybe. You know, he came in second place in 2016. And Joe Biden, I think, is one of the other names that we're definitely watching in terms of, you know, can he take advantage of the fact that he enters this race in a polling lead with the highest favorable ratings? Or is it going to be the case that, because he's been out of politics for such a long time, that maybe he's, you know, not going to be able to rev up the engine.</p><p>CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS CORRESPONDENT AND EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Yes, the nightmare scenario for Biden -- let me say this. If you're a betting person and you have $20 that you really don't want to lose, the safest bet, I think Harry and I would agree, is probably Biden, in that he's ahead right now in any poll. He's the best known candidate. But safest is a relative term.</p><p>The nightmare scenario is this: that it winds up as a replay, in some ways, of the 2008 presidential Democratic primary, which is Biden playing the Hillary Clinton role of sort of established frontrunner, carrying all that baggage; and Beto O'Rourke playing the Obama role from 2008: exciting, young upstart, doesn't have that much of a record to attack on. A lot of organic energy behind his campaign.</p><p>So Biden has to -- has to contend with that as, frankly, do Bernie Sanders, do Elizabeth Warren, do any of those people above Beto O'Rourke. He is -- if you went to Iowa and polled the candidate that excites you the most, not necessarily the one you're going to vote for, but the one that excites you most, the one you want to learn more about, O'Rourke is almost certainly that guy. And don't underestimate that in politics. Organic energy and passion is the hardest thing to build.</p><p>[07:20:11] BERMAN: I will note, Joe Biden might be excited just not to play the Joe Biden role from past presidential elections.</p><p>CILLIZZA: That's true.</p><p>BERMAN: Because he's run twice and done basically zero.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Well, and President Trump, he says a lot of things that aren't true. He does say that, and it is true about Joe Biden.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes. CILLIZZA: Look, Joe Biden is the frontrunner today because he was the vice president of the United States for eight years. But let's remember, in '88 he drops out in '87, amid charges of plagiarism. In 2008, he never gets going in any meaningful way.</p><p>BERMAN: So we like to say the only poll that matters is the one on election day. The other one that matters is the one we just did in Iowa among Democrats in that state, along with \"The Des Moines Register.\" And I just want to put that up on the screen here, because it gets to what you're talking about.</p><p>Joe Biden leads in the polling for the Democratic nominee among likely Democratic caucus goers. Joe Biden is at 32 percent. Bernie Sanders in second at 19; and then Beto O'Rourke is at 11 percent. And that to me, Harry, is the story of this poll, is that Beto, a guy who has never campaigned in Iowa, you know, is -- a few weeks off of losing for a race in Texas, is the only other guy in double digits.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes, I mean, you look at the name recognition numbers in that particular poll, and you see, you know, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, pretty much everybody knows who they are. But very few people -- or there are many people who don't know who Beto O'Rourke is. And so the fact that he's already broken into double digits, to me is just another example that he has a lot of energy in the Democratic base.</p><p>But of course, remember, he just ran in Texas. Let's see him actually get out on the national campaign trail and see if he can keep that momentum going. Let's see him get actually tested by other Democrats about his record because, for example, if you look at his record ,it's not exactly the most progressive among Democrats nationwide. And if he actually gets attacked from the left, then maybe he won't be able to hold up as well as we think he might.</p><p>CILLIZZA: And I think one of the things -- Harry and I have been -- we do rankings every month about 2020. We have Kamala Harris No. 1 right now and Beto No. 2.</p><p>One of the things that we both take a significant amount of criticism for is where we rank Bernie Sanders, which is outside of the top five, top six we usually have him. And I think one of the reasons Harry touched on with O'Rourke, which is that remember that Bernie Sanders didn't really get a significant negative attack from Hillary Clinton as it related to his very long voting record in Congress. She would sort of go here and there and then there would be these warnings: \"You can't attack each other. How dare you attack him?\" She laid kid gloves on him.</p><p>My guess is this time around, if his poll numbers stay roughly where they are, he's going to get a more thorough cleansing of that record. Now, maybe he withstands that. But anyone who has been in Congress, the House and now the Senate, for as long as he is, as we saw with John Kerry, as we saw with virtually every senator before Barack Obama and John Kennedy, running for president in the Senate isn't great, because you have a lot of \"I voted for it before I voted against it\" kind of votes that Bernie Sanders would be answerable to -- for, too. BERMAN: Cleansings can be uncomfortable.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Can they?</p><p>BERMAN: Take my word for it. A cleansing is sometimes --</p><p>CILLIZZA: Happy 2019.</p><p>BERMAN: Cleansing --</p><p>CAMEROTA: That's how he has been since New Year's Eve.</p><p>BERMAN: -- can be --</p><p>CILLIZZA: Wow. Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Explain this graphic to me and why this is significant. This is the Iowa speaking list for Progress Iowa's holiday party speakers. Eric Swalwell -- here, we'll put it up here. Andrew Yang, Jeff Merkley, Mayor Pete --</p><p>ENTEN: Buttigieg.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Buttigieg.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- Buttigieg. So what am I supposed to glean from this?</p><p>ENTEN: I mean, these are people who we think probably, they're running for president, or at least they've made some signals that they're running. Andrew Yang's people have certainly e-mailed me enough, so I know that he's definitely running.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Confirmed.</p><p>ENTEN: I don't -- yes, both of us.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Yes.</p><p>ENTEN: But I don't -- look, those people are running, but just because you're running doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to win. There are going to be so many --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Is that right?</p><p>ENTEN: I know, right?</p><p>CAMEROTA: I'm going to take that to the bank.</p><p>ENTEN: Maybe John, Alisyn, both of you can run. You can also run.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Here's the thing. There are 30-plus serious candidates, people who are in elected office who have been in elected office.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>CILLIZZA: There may wind up being -- I think this -- we both agree this will be the largest Democratic field in modern history.</p><p>One thing to remember: Harry said a lot of people running who won't win. Not all of them are running for president. I know that's the office they're filing for, but a lot of them like Pete Buttigieg, for example.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CILLIZZA: He's mayor of South Bend. He announced in December he's not running for another term. He's an interesting guy, wants to be in the mix nationally. You know, could he wind up in a Democratic cabinet? Sure. Would that be a huge win for him? Absolutely. Is the best way to do it running for president and raising your profile? Also yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Very, very quickly, because the top three on the Iowa poll, the Iowa poll is Biden, Sanders, O'Rourke. We keep on saying, one of the lessons from 2018, especially in the Democratic Party, is women and minorities.</p><p>ENTEN: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: How big of a push will there be, do you think, in the primary to see the candidate be a woman or a minority?</p><p>ENTEN: I think there will be a big push from the base and, certainly, from special interest groups.</p><p>Another way to think about this, though, is if you look at the favorable to unfavorable ratio that you see because, remember, people like Kamala Harris don't have very high name recognition at this point.</p><p>But if you look only at the people who have been able to form an opinion of these candidates, you see her jump all the way up to No. 2. And you see Joe Biden still at No. 1. But it sort of looks a lot more like our rankings with Booker and O'Rourke up there.</p><p>[07:25:10] And I think that that, to me, is an indication that, once these candidates get better known -- Harris, Gillibrand, they will end up being able to come up in the polls more so than these current numbers indicate.</p><p>CILLIZZA: Which is why we have Kamala No. 1.</p><p>I mean, someone who is on this air often, not you, John, or you Alisyn, but someone whose initials are C.C. often sends me notes saying, \"Oh, Kamala Harris, you and Harry have her No. 1, but she's nowhere to the polls, to which I remind him -- let's just call him C. Cuomo for now, preserve his anonymity. To which I remind him, the vote is not January 1, 2019. The vote first starts in the beginning of 2020. So we have some time here for this race --</p><p>CAMEROTA: I feel like he knows that.</p><p>CILLIZZA: -- to form. If you are ahead today, yes, you'd rather be ahead than be behind, but being ahead today is predictive of nothing or we would have had a President Giuliani, a President Jeb Bush, a President Hillary Clinton. We don't have any of those.</p><p>ENTEN: Good thing you clarified, though. I thought you were talking about Christopher Cross myself.</p><p>CILLIZZA: No.</p><p>BERMAN: \"Sailing.\" \"Sailing.\"</p><p>CILLIZZA (singing): Sailing --</p><p>BERMAN: When you get caught between the moon and New York City.</p><p>CILLIZZA (singing): -- take me away.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. Chris Cillizza, Harry Enten, thank you all.</p><p>CILLIZZA: We're going to sing more in 2019.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Thank you, guys.</p><p>BERMAN: Thank you all for being with us. Appreciate it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK. Yes, it's running off the rails.</p><p>BERMAN: Happy new year.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Happy new year. I said no drinking on this day, guys.</p><p>CILLIZZA: All right.</p><p>ENTEN: Sorry.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Meanwhile, President Trump angered supporters and critics alike in 2018 by getting close to dictators like Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin and criticizing allies. Let's face it: some people liked it; some people didn't. What can we expect this year on the global stage?

''Also, successful firms tend to grow, and it is important that antitrust enforcement and competition policy not be used to punish firms for their competitive success.''</p><p>  That assessment was consistent with the bright picture that administration officials painted in the report on the health of the economy.</p><p>  They forecast growth of 3.1 percent for the year, measuring fourth quarter over fourth quarter, although that prediction relies on Congress passing a large-scale infrastructure plan and other policy initiatives that appear unlikely in an election year. Without those, the growth forecast falls below 3 percent.</p><p>  This year's report takes direct aim at the 2016 report presented by Mr. Obama and his Council of Economic Advisers, then led by the Harvard economist Jason Furman, which warned that rising market concentration was hampering economic dynamism and exacerbating inequality.</p><p>  The Trump administration has approved some high-profile corporate mergers, like the marriage of Sprint and T-Mobile, while trying to block others, like AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner. In their report, Mr. Trump's advisers say federal agencies already have the tools they need to evaluate those mergers and other antitrust cases. It laments that some Americans have come to hold the ''mistaken, simplistic view that 'Big Is Bad.'''</p><p>  New research released Thursday by the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute for Economics offers new evidence for why populist politicians like Mr. Trump should be concerned with whether market concentration is in fact rising in the economy: The rise hurts blue-collar workers, like those employed in factories, more than everyone else.</p><p>  The research, from the University of Chicago economists Greg Kaplan and Piotr Zoch, does not seek to quantify whether concentration has gone up or down in recent years. Instead, it studies what happens to particular classes of workers when companies increasingly dominate a market and have more power to raise prices. It finds that some workers -- those who make things -- are hurt in when their employer dominates an industry. The workers who sell or market or design things gain.</p><p>  ''It's leading to an increase in the incomes of white-collar workers,'' Mr. Kaplan said in an interview, ''at the expense of blue-collar workers.''</p><p>  There's a relatively simple explanation for why that is. When companies have more pricing power, they make fewer products and sell each one for a higher profit margin. In that case, it's far more valuable to a company to be an employee working in so-called expansionary positions, like marketing, than in production jobs, like working a factory line -- because there's less production to be done and more salesmanship.</p><p>  Mr. Trump has repeatedly highlighted his administration's record of delivering for the production workers he targeted in his 2016 campaign promises. The new economic report is no exception.</p><p>  In recent decades, the report says, the government disproportionately regulated industries like manufacturing ''that offer fulfilling, blue collar jobs for the majority of Americans who do not have a college degree.''</p><p>  ''These misguided policy decisions,'' it continues, ''imposed real-world costs that created barriers to success and prosperity for hardworking Americans. Those days are over.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The administration effectively dismisses research that finds large American companies increasingly dominate industries like telecommunications and tech, stifling competition and hurting consumers.

He said Facebook must ensure that Libra won't hurt consumers or be used for illegal activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We will demand guarantees that such transactions cannot be diverted, for example for financing terrorism,\" he said on Europe-1 radio.</p><p>Facebook unveiled its much-rumored currency Tuesday and said it will launch publicly early next year with such partners as Uber, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.</p><p>Libra could open online purchasing to millions of people who do not have access to bank accounts and could reduce the cost of sending money across borders.</p><p> But it comes as Facebook already faces scrutiny over its poor record on privacy and its dominance in social media, messaging and related businesses.</p><p>Libra poses new questions for Facebook: Given that cryptocurrency is lightly regulated now, if at all, how will financial regulators oversee Facebook's plan? And just how much more personal data will this give the social media giant, anyway?</p><p>'Rude awakening' over regulation?</p><p> The financial industry is more heavily regulated than internet companies - especially in the U.S., where tech companies have often been given free rein.</p><p> Companies creating Libra are in for a \"rude awakening\" if they expect the same model of light regulation, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics in Washington.</p><p> She expects Libra will fall under U.S. regulations adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Which agency will oversee the venture will depend on what the currency system does, she said.</p><p>France's Le Maire said he asked central bank chiefs from the G-7 countries to produce a report by mid-July laying out \"guarantees that we must set ? to assure us that there are no risks of illicit financing or for the consumer.\"</p><p> In the U.S., the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee said Facebook's new digital currency will give the tech giant unfair competitive advantages in collecting data on financial transactions as well as control over fees.</p><p> \"Facebook is already too big and too powerful,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.</p><p> One hurdle Facebook and its partners will face is the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud, given the pseudo-anonymous nature of Libra and other digital currencies.</p><p>Facebook said it will comply with all existing financial regulations, though it has not offered many details. The company said its wallet app for using Libra will walk people through a verification process to ensure they are who they say they are.</p><p> Still, Facebook is sure to face an onslaught of liability concerns when it comes to anti-money laundering and identity verification, said Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p> \"I am shocked they have decided to go ahead,\" he said.</p><p>Privacy pushback?</p><p>Facebook has been dogged with questions about users' personal data, especially since the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit last year.</p><p> That appears to be part of the reason Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association to govern Libra. It also created a subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business.</p><p> \"We've heard loud and clear that you don't want social and financial data commingled,\" Calibra head David Marcus wrote on Twitter, addressing Facebook users. \"We understand we will have to earn your trust.\"</p><p> In some ways, privacy is the enemy in the battle against money laundering and other crimes, Weaver said. You want to know who is making transactions to keep them secure and legal, he said.</p><p>Facebook is \"going to get access to a lot of financial data,\" Forrester analyst Aurelie L'Hostis said. \"What are they going to do with that information and what are they going to put in place to safeguard that information?\"</p><p> Cryptocurrencies such as Libra store all transactions on a widely distributed, encrypted ledger known as the blockchain. Libra is designed so transaction amounts are visible, but transaction participants can be anonymous - at least until they move money into real-world accounts.</p><p>Facebook said people can keep their individual transactions from appearing on the blockchain by using Calibra's wallet app, though in that case, Calibra itself would have people's data.</p><p> Calibra said it won't use financial data to target ads on Facebook. It also said it won't share financial data with Facebook, though there are exceptions that haven't been fully spelled out, including situations where data sharing would \"keep people safe.\"</p><p>Antitrust red flags?</p><p>Congress has launched an inquiry into whether Big Tech giants such as Facebook and Google have gotten too big.</p><p> Regulatory bodies including the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department are said to be considering investigations.</p><p> Adding another major business will make Facebook bigger - if Libra takes off as intended - but it may not raise major antitrust red flags, said New York University law professor Eleanor Fox.</p><p> \"It is a grassroots entry into a new field and can actually reflect an increase in innovation,\" she said.</p><p> Still, she said, people could be alarmed because of Facebook's use of data in the past. And Justice Department officials have hinted they may take a broader view of harm to competition to go well beyond whether a company's dominance leads to higher prices.</p><p> Sarah Miller, deputy director of Open Markets Institute, which advocates against monopolies, said it was \"insanity\" to trust Facebook to launch a global cryptocurrency when it is already facing regulatory scrutiny around the world over data privacy.</p><p> \"The FTC needs to rein in Facebook before the corporation puts our financial information and currency systems at risk, too,\" she said.</p><p>\"It is a grassroots entry into a new field and can actually</p><p>reflect an increase in innovation.\"</p><p>Eleanor Fox</p><p>New York University law professor, on antitrust questions surrounding Facebook's foray into digital currency</p><p>Libra</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-34543065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCG-JYH1-JC0C-J360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The film starts with hotshot programmer Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe) getting recruited by tech tycoon Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), who runs a massive and ubiquitous computing company called NURV.</p><p>Just like Microsoft, NURV is being investigated for antitrust violations, although it s less clear why. (We learn vaguely that NURV is infamous for cloning software, and that it s building some kind of media empire with hardware like set-top boxes.) Where Microsoft was once referred to as the  Death Star,  billionaire philanthropist Winston complains about websites calling him Satan. But Milo s job is to make NURV far more powerful than Microsoft ever was since NURV is about to launch a data network called Synapse that will link  every communication device on the planet. </p><p>the fictionalized Microsoft in  Antitrust  is deeply criminal, but it s not very good at it</p><p>Director Peter Howitt has said Antitrust was inspired by the  part of us [that] wants to believe you can t be that successful without being really badly criminal.  To be sure, Microsoft was on trial for doing something illegal. But Howitt describes Antitrust as playing to our even darker collective suspicions about modern capitalism where  we think there must be some bodies buried somewhere. </p><p>It might be more accurate to say that NURV is successful despite being badly criminal. NURV   an acronym for  Never Underestimate Radical Vision,  pronounced  nerve,  like the sinister task force in Neon Genesis Evangelion   is enthusiastically running a triathlon of evil. It s a monopolistic, anti-open-source conglomerate like Microsoft. It s a generic Silicon Valley super corporation that controls the flow of information and keeps invasive surveillance dossiers on its employees. And while all these characteristics might work to its advantage, it s also gratuitously, impractically, and sometimes counterproductively into murder.</p><p>As Milo starts work on Synapse, he realizes the project is way behind schedule and working on an incredibly tight deadline. Then, Winston starts feeding the design team some brilliant code... and programmers outside the company, including one of Milo s friends, start dying. Coincidence? Of course not.</p><p>Killing people is apparently easier than hiring some good antitrust lawyers</p><p>Antitrust s conceit is that NURV is on its way to becoming the most powerful tech company in history (including Microsoft, which canonically exists in this universe), yet it s so afraid of antitrust regulators that it will carry out elaborate and deadly heists to avoid officially acquiring a competitor, despite having already infiltrated the government agency responsible for investigating antitrust claims. Unfortunately, good software developers are also incredibly rare in Antitrust s world. Winston tells Milo there are 20 people in the world capable of finishing Synapse on time, and he s one of them.</p><p>So where some companies might meet a deadline by hiring more employees or implementing crunch hours, NURV is stuck crafting schemes to plagiarize these super coders  work. The company s development workflow involves finding a programmer writing exactly the right code for a project, planting cameras in their apartment to capture their typing, sending one of NURV s own employees to bludgeon the programmer to death, framing a local gang, storing camera footage of the murder on a database secretly located in a day care center, then passing the deeply suspicious code to another employee that it recruited through a months-long honeypot operation. It s the corporate equivalent of building a death ray to rob a lemonade stand.</p><p>The implication is that a powerful figure like Gary Winston can get away with poorly executed, bizarrely complex, and fairly blatant criminality because he s neutralized anyone who has the power to stop him. Antitrust blends classic conspiracy tropes with anti-monopoly arguments as Milo realizes that every powerful institution is associated with NURV, including a news media that s been compromised by partnerships.</p><p>A company that owns everything can get away with anything</p><p>This is a timeless, often appropriate kind of cynicism, and it feels particularly relevant while we re in the midst of two huge mergers involving some of the biggest tech and media companies in existence. Antitrust was released at a point where Microsoft had been declared a monopoly and ordered to break itself up, but even that condemnation softened over time since it later settled to avoid a split. NURV s investments parallel Microsoft s deals with Comcast, WebTV, and other companies in the  90s, but they also echo the structure of modern vertical monopolies. NURV s non-Synapse software is limited to vaguely handwaved  programs,  but a news report mentions that it s been buying up cable companies and telecom Baby Bells.</p><p>But Antitrust is also incredibly idealistic about the power of transparency. Milo manages to turn Synapse against Winston and NURV, hijacking the world s screens to share a video of the killings mixed with slogans like  MURDERED FOR CODE.  The world immediately turns against Winston and his co-conspirators, they re arrested, and Milo rejoins his old startup, which is based around open-source principles.  Do you consider this the ultimate victory for open source?  a reporter gushes.</p><p>It might not be the ultimate victory, but Antitrust does take place in a world where being able to access and distribute information   a key element of open source   creates a fairer, better world. It s part of an old vision of the web that s become a lot fuzzier recently, and it s a striking contrast to much of the reality of antitrust in 2018 when the world s most popular open-source software platform s creator is being fined for operating a monopoly. Antitrust isn t a dark commentary about Microsoft blurring the line between virtual and physical harm   or, in Milo s words, forgetting that  in the real world, when you kill people, they die. For real!  It s an unevenly entertaining, often ridiculous fantasy that makes crushing competition look a lot harder than it really is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17827992/antitrust-tim-robbins-bill-gates-microsoft-retrospective\">https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17827992/antitrust-tim-robbins-bill-gates-microsoft-retrospective</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Adi Robertson<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp877425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T8F-T3T1-JCTB-F368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><timeReceived>11:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 15, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A company that owns everything can get away with anything This is a timeless, often appropriate kind of cynicism, and it feels particularly relevant while we're in the midst oftwohugemergers involving some of the biggest tech and media companies in existence.Antitrustwas released at a point where Microsoft had been declared a monopoly and ordered to break itself up, but even that condemnation softened over time since it later settled to avoid a split. NURV's investments parallel Microsoft's deals with Comcast, WebTV, and other companies in the \u201890s, but they also echo the structure of modern vertical monopolies. NURV's non-Synapse software is limited to vaguely handwaved 'programs, but a news report mentions that it's been buying up cable companies and telecomBaby Bells. ButAntitrustis also incredibly idealistic about the power of transparency. Milo manages to turn Synapse against Winston and NURV, hijacking the world's screens to share a video of the killings mixed with slogans like 'MURDERED FOR CODE. The world immediately turns against Winston and his co-conspirators, they're arrested, and Milo rejoins his old startup, which is based around open-source principles. 'Do you consider this the ultimate victory for open source? a reporter gushes. It might not be theultimatevictory, butAntitrustdoes take place in a world where being able to access and distribute information \u2014 a key element of open source \u2014 creates a fairer, better world. It's part of an old vision of the web that'sbecome a lot fuzzierrecently, and it's a striking contrast to much of the reality of antitrust in 2018 when the world's most popular open-source software platform's creatoris being finedfor operating a monopoly.Antitrustisn't a dark commentary about Microsoft blurring the line between virtual and physical harm \u2014 or, in Milo's words, forgetting that 'in the real world, when you kill people,they die.For real! It's an unevenly entertaining, often ridiculous fantasy that makes crushing competition look a lot harder than it really is.

Data is becoming one of the world's most important commodities.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> Its new found position has brought it under the scrutiny of regulators across the world. In Europe, a raft of judicial decisions is coming ashore that could fundamentally change how data is collected, managed and used by businesses and individuals.&lt;nl/&gt; The latest judicial milestone, courtesy of the European Court of Justice, is a ruling against Safe Harbour.\u00a0In a nutshell, Safe Harbour is a data share transfer agreement between the US and EU.&lt;nl/&gt; Critics have argued that because the US did not have to meet EU data protection requirements it provided insufficient protection for EU citizens. With the agreement, which was created in 1999, now annulled there are big question marks as to how US tech companies will need to respond.&lt;nl/&gt; The immediate consequence appears to be that US companies that deal with personal data about people living within the EU will have to keep that data in Europe.&lt;nl/&gt; Practically, this means many more new data centres will need to be built to store this information and data management procedures will need to change.\u00a0For big tech companies like Google and Facebook, the ruling is a nuisance, but as many of them already have significant data management infrastructure in countries like the Republic of Ireland, it won't be a complete game-changer.&lt;nl/&gt; It's smaller, data-intensive American tech companies who lack significant resources in the EU will be the most severely affected.&lt;nl/&gt; The Safe Harbour judgement follows another decision last week, also by the ECJ, involving a Hungarian online advertising company that transferred data to a debt collection agency.&lt;nl/&gt; The ECJ decided that if a company has a website translated into another language - i.e. targets consumers in another member state - it will have to comply with the data protection rules that govern that country.&lt;nl/&gt; This creates a headache for businesses that operate in multiple European companies. Previously, a company residing in the UK only had to pay attention to UK data laws. Now, many businesses both within and outside the EU will need to review and update their data compliance procedures to observe several different sets of rules.&lt;nl/&gt; Adding another layer of complication is the pan-European data protection directive which is due to hit sometime next year.&lt;nl/&gt; On paper, the directive should homogenise rules thus making life simpler for businesses. However, the latest draft of the directive contains multiple flexible provisions that can be interpreted in different ways by each member state. There are also several passages that contain unsettlingly vague phrases. For example, there's a rule that allows companies to change how and what they do with data if they can show 'legitimate interest'. Just what constitutes a 'legitimate interest' is anyone's guess.&lt;nl/&gt; The changing environment in relation to data protection isn't confined to Europe. In the US, another case relating to whether the US Government can access information stored in a data centre in the Republic of Ireland will undoubtedly cause a stir when the judgement is handed down.&lt;nl/&gt; Undoubtedly, the Edward Snowden affair has coloured some of the argument in Europe in relation to data protection. Few people could argue convincingly that there is currently enough transparency or protection for consumers. However, my fear is that the volume of changes coming down the track is creating a more complicated and dangerous environment.&lt;nl/&gt; Many of the online services we all enjoy are dependent on the global free flow of data. Much of the innovation currently taking place in areas such as wearable technology, smart cities and the Internet of Things is also heavily data dependent. Unilateral action by the EU or other countries risks creating a protectionist legislative arms race which will ultimately harm consumers.&lt;nl/&gt; A better strategy would be to take a more conciliatory approach to data protection that is grounded in ethical usage and transparency. By working closely with other nations and businesses, we can create a global solution that offers a level playing field for tech companies, while also giving consumers adequate protection. This would obviously require a lot of cooperation, however, maintaining trust in how data is collected, stored and analysed is in all our interests.&lt;nl/&gt; Mike Weston is CEO of data science consultancy Profusion[1]&lt;nl/&gt;

Every new year brings its challenges and 2019 promises more uncertainty than most. Yet there will be also be happy surprises, opportunities, fresh hope. Life will improve for billions of people around Earth. And there will be much to distract and entertain us along the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the UK, we will eat less meat, use less plastic, and create more renewable energy. People will give more of their money and time to charity, continuing a British trend.</p><p>The hype around graphene - the superconductor discovered in Manchester - will start to become reality. Gene therapy will, leading geneticists predict, cure some people of sickle cell disease, making this one of the first molecular cures. Excitement around such treatments will be high, if cost prohibitive. Prosthetic limbs will become more sophisticated, allowing paralysed patients to not only control them but to sense, too.</p><p>As well as five eclipses, physicists believe 2019 will be the year we see a black hole.</p><p>In June, many people in Europe will pause to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, celebrating peace, freedom and fraternity.</p><p>Sports fans are in for a treat, with four World Cups. Asia's first Rugby World Cup kicks off in Tokyo in September. Expect New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa to excel. Meanwhile England's elite women players have finally been offered full-time contracts, encouraging more girls to take up the sport.</p><p>2019 is a huge year for cricket in England and Wales, who host the World Cup. For the first time, England start as favourites. Then August brings the Ashes.</p><p>In June, England and Scotland clash at the women's football World Cup in France, while Gareth Southgate's men have a shot at winning the Uefa Nations League, playing Netherlands in the semi-final. We have the most exciting Premier League battle in years, fought by two thrilling teams. Leeds United play exhilarating football and could celebrate their centenary with a return to the top flight. In Scotland, the revival of Rangers and Kilmarnock sets up a five-way tussle for the title.</p><p>Tracey Neville's England netball team - Commonwealth champions - have World Cup home advantage in Liverpool. In cycling, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas contest a keenly anticipated Tour de France, while Yorkshire will bring record crowds to the Road World Championships. The world's fastest woman, Dina Asher-Smith, competes at the Worlds ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>Big tech firms will face tighter regulation as governments wake up. Cinema will continue to decline as a social pastime, as Netflix and other disrupters transform home entertainment. Film highlights include Martin Scorsese's new mafia epic The Irishman with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci; Toy Story 4, Greed (Steve Coogan plays a monstrous retail tycoon), Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and, for smaller humans, Frozen 2. Disney releases live-action versions of The Lion King, Dumbo and Aladdin. Game of Thrones ends in April and, 34 years after The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood's sequel, The Testaments, is published.</p><p>Leading screen actors will take to the stage: Cate Blanchett (When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other), Tom Hiddleston (Betrayal), Gillian Anderson and Lily James (All About Eve), and Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer (A Slight Ache/The Dumb Waiter). Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen, about a schoolboy who fakes messages from a dead classmate to become popular, transfers here.</p><p>Earth will not be destroyed by a giant asteroid on 4 February: \"2002 AJ129\" will miss by 2.6 million miles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000031527910-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V36-G531-JCS0-D1VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 31, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Just last week, one of the industry's biggest companies, Google, announced new policies after revelations and protests over giant payouts to male executives ousted amid sexual harassment claims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech firms' harvesting and abuse of personal data led to strict new rules in the European Union, the public upbraiding of CEOs before congressional committees and, last week, a hilarious takedown of Amazon.com by comedian Hasan Minhaj on his Netflix show \"Patriot Act.\"</p><p>One of the most powerful journalists covering the industry, Kara Swisher, called last month for tech companies to hire \"chief ethics officers\" after so many have recently been swept up in scandals - from manipulating regulators, mistreating shareholders and losing customers' data to becoming dependent on investments from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>For Lucie Greene, the director of the innovation group at media agency J. Walter Thompson, this reckoning springs from ambition colliding with boundless capital and has been building for years. At a tech conference in 2014, she noticed that several of Silicon Valley's biggest names were talking less about their companies and more about changing society.</p><p>\"It seemed to me like the ambition of the brands had gotten much, much bigger,\" Greene said. \"These companies had much bigger civic claims. You saw Facebook talking about schools and transport systems, white papers coming from Uber.\"</p><p>Greene started thinking about what the world would be like if it was designed by Silicon Valley techies. She put down the result of those thoughts and her research in a new book called \"Silicon States: The Power and Politics of Big Tech and What It Means For Our Future.\"</p><p>Her chief conclusion: Unlike government, which spends money on everyone and works in places no one else will go, tech companies are driven by profit first.</p><p>\"Even if they're using economies of scale to make something more affordable, everything that they produce, whatever the altruistic rhetoric, has a commercial end,\" Greene said during a recent visit to Minneapolis. \"It's always an 80-percent solution from tech. It's not a 100-percent solution.\"</p><p>Many of the conflicts making headlines in the tech industry today spring from executives deciding to place more importance on convenience than fairness. Greene cites numerous examples in her book. Airbnb boasts of democratizing travel, but travelers have encountered biases from property owners about who is allowed to rent. Amazon builds out a delivery system that rivals the postal service but excludes lower-income urban neighborhoods. Uber creates a ride-sharing service that, in giving passengers power to rate drivers and affect pay, puts women drivers at greater risk than men.</p><p>\"These services are consumer-centric,\" Greene said. \"But thanks to the funding system in Silicon Valley, they don't necessarily need to be profitable. And they're able to scale and unseat businesses that do have to pay taxes, that have to comply with regulations, that have to pay severance and maternity leave.\"</p><p>Even as she criticizes the reach and power of the nation's biggest tech firms, Greene calls herself a \"complete hypocrite,\" saying she uses Amazon and Uber frequently. Minhaj made a similar observation in his criticism of Amazon, saying on his Netflix show that he is addicted to the convenience of its Prime Now two-hour delivery service.</p><p>\"I am not the only one who is hooked,\" Minhaj said. \"Advertisers are hooked on Amazon's data. Vendors are hooked on its customers. Politicians are hooked on its jobs. Companies are hooked on its servers. And Wall Street is hooked on its stock price.\"</p><p>But the trade-off of from all that, Greene said, is \"disconnection from collective community and civic purpose and spirit.\"</p><p>Until recently, tech executives tamped down such criticism. When scholars and others raised concerns about data protection and privacy in the past, Greene noted the typical response from a tech executive was \"You don't believe in internet freedom, do you?\" or \"Do you want to stop innovation?\" \"Tech companies have employed very polarized rhetoric to sidestep meaningful dialogue or criticism,\" Greene said.</p><p>A few signs are emerging that tech firms are feeling the pushback. A French company called Snips is advertising a home-automation system that, in contrast to other innovators, doesn't collect information about how or when customers use it.</p><p>Addressing the prospect of restrictions on data collection and use, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year the company should expect to be regulated and will \"work with any set of regulations we are given.\" And in a speech at a privacy conference in Brussels last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook declared that personal data was being \"weaponized\" against individuals and the greater good.</p><p>\"This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy. And those of us who believe in technology's potential for good must not shrink from this moment,\" Cook said.</p><p>Then, there's the other extreme. In China, tech firms are working with the government to create a \"social credit\" system that monitors whether people spend wisely and how they behave in public areas.</p><p>\"We're 20 years into mass use of the internet and 15 years into social media,\" Greene said. \"I think you are really starting to see people question what we've inherited.\"</p><p>Evan Ramstad \u00b7 612-673-4241</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN52324000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRC-B991-JC8F-K004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 14, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is the virus itself that causes economic harm, and without putting a strategy in place to contain it, growth will be hit lockdown or no lockdown.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>He refers to a paper from economists at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202080v2.pdf\"> Becker Friedman Institute</url> at the University of Chicago that looked at mobile phone records of more than 2m US businesses, and concludes lockdowns were only responsible for a fifth of the recent decline in economic activity. The main driver was a shift in consumer behaviour.</p><p>George says a \u201ckey takeaway\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. is that the market should now reward measures that bring the virus back in control, so any state action that reduces diseases transmission (including lockdowns) are likely to be a market positive, not negative\u201d.</p><p>Nicholas Colas at DataTrek weighs in on this topic after enduring the recent lockdown in Manhattan: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary to watch, but we also know there are simple things local populations can do to mitigate Covid spread. Every region seeing rising case counts will do them. It\u2019s not an \u2018if\u2019; it\u2019s a \u2018when\u2019.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>The price action suggests sentiment is looking on the brighter side, with modest gains in Europe followed by a late afternoon rally for Wall Street, led by banks. Regulatory relief for banks is a tonic, although the final cost of defaults and failed business awaits. </p><p>So where does this leave equities and other risk assets, after a big quarter of gains now has them looking vulnerable to further economic setbacks over the summer?</p><p>DataTrek has been applying the play book from the March 2009 recovery and at this stage of the 2020 rebound, history suggests \u201c25-ish more trading days where the S&amp;P will wander in the wilderness\u201d, and adds:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cBottom line is that during this period in 2009 it was very tempting to see this volatility as a sign stocks were about to roll over again. But they did not.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>One interesting point of difference between the financial crisis and today \u2014 among many \u2014 is how shares in the technology sector are viewed by most investors through the lens of being a haven from broader market stress. During the financial crisis, tech was a cyclical and lower government bond yields reflected a poor economic outlook, which spurred selling of the sector along with many other equity groups. </p><p>Dhaval Joshi at BCA Research says tech\u2019s \u201chaven\u201d or defensive qualities reflect in part how the composition of the group \u2018\u2018has flipped from hardware dominance to software dominance. In 2008, the sector market cap had a 65:35 tilt to technology hardware. But today, it is the mirror-image: a 65:35 tilt to computer and software services.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Now computer and software services certainly rank highly in having plenty of cash \u2014 a very defensive quality \u2014 while the pandemic has heightened their role in an economy that involves both working and being educated at home. (Junior detests Microsoft Teams, by the way, and misses the social interaction of the schoolroom and, I suspect, the lunch menu.)</p><p>The rush for all things tech naturally arouses questions about a bubble and sky-high valuations. </p><p>Over at Bank of America, its latest research investment committee note highlights how a basket of tech-favoured exchange traded funds that engage in hefty research and development has outperformed the broad market this year and sits near a record high. The ETFs in the following chart track companies in medical devices, biotech, aerospace and defence, autonomous tech and robotics, artificial intelligence and semi conductors:</p><p>What links these groups and explains their already impressive performance is the prospect of a US government-mandated shift\u00a0toward more R&amp;D and industrial policy, reckons BofA and it adds:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u2018\u2018Policymaker priorities\u00a0have already begun to shift;\u00a0in recent months &gt;20\u00a0new bills from both political parties have been introduced\u00a0to spur\u00a0R&amp;D,\u00a0boost capex, strengthen supply chains, protect\u00a0intellectual property\u00a0from theft by foreign governments and protect the US energy grid from cyber attacks.\u2019\u2019</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>That\u2019s a powerful tailwind and BofA reminds us that: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u2018\u2018Federal funding in 1971 for the war on cancer is still giving us new drugs today; more recently,\u00a0every key component of\u00a0the\u00a0smartphone exists because of funding to government agencies, universities and non-profit [groups].\u2019\u2019\u00a0</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Still, a broader question for investors is one of sticking with tech for an extended journey. </p><p>BCA\u2019s Dhaval for one thinks: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u2018\u2018The recent run-up in growth defensives such as tech and healthcare does make sense. Their valuations have moved in near-perfect lockstep with the bond yield, implying that the rally is based on fundamentals.\u2019\u2019</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>True, as shown by this BCA chart, the gap between the tech and healthcare forward earnings yield and the bond yield\u00a0has\u00a0gone up this year and is much larger than in 2018: </p><p>Dhaval adds: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u2018\u2018In a longer-term perspective the current gap between the tech and healthcare forward earnings yield and the bond yield, at +4 per cent, hardly indicates a mania. In the true mania of 2000, the gap stood at -4 per cent!\u2019\u2019</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Another interesting observation comes via DataTrek\u2019s Nick about the dominance of a select group of companies within the US equity market:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u2018\u2018Big Tech is sucking up ever more US equity market cap, but a long run look at the top 10 stocks back to the 1920s shows that dominant names usually make up 15-35 per cent of the whole market.

He served in a number of government positions during the 1990s, including associate director and chief information officer of the U.S. Information Agency under <person><nameText>President Bill Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He's also been a businessman, holding executive positions at French media company Vivendi Universal, as well as serving in an assortment of policy and regulatory advisory groups in Washington and California. </p><p>Since 2008, Spalter has brought his government and business backgrounds to bear as the chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition of companies and nonprofit organizations with a key interest in policy that helps to advance mobile innovation.</p><h>Why was Mobile Future formed? </h><p>n Often those who were regulating and legislating the industry could barely keep up with the turbo-charged pace at which the wireless industry was changing. We thought there was an opportunity to create a new platform for helping to educate policymakers about what was going on at the very edges of innovation in mobility and wireless, as well as an opportunity to make sure those who are out there innovating in the mobile wireless space have better vision of what's going on in the very important hallways and offices in Washington.</p><h>One of your primary focus areas is spectrum, or the airwaves over which telecommunication companies move data. Why?</h><p>n The huge amount of data that consumers are using is an explosion of both opportunity but also demand on the networks. What's ultimately fueling that demand is the invisible resource of spectrum. It's managed by the government. The government owns most of it. Yet we're on this path to even more exciting chapters in the evolution of mobility and wireless, all of which will be based on increasing reliance on sustainable and secure access to spectrum.</p><p>We thought if we are going to continue to really enjoy and use these new innovations that are having such a sweeping impact on our businesses and lives, we really have to shine a bright, focused light on making sure the government is getting it right on spectrum management and spectrum policy.</p><h>What should the government do to speed up the spectrum auction process?</h><p>n The good news is that our government now really gets it when it comes to understanding the need for speed in getting more spectrum into the marketplace. To continue this progress, it must make crafting an effective, open, transparent and simple auction design a key priority. It also must speed up the review process for secondary market transactions, and ensure federal government agencies do not drag their feet on achieving President Obama's goal to meaningfully reallocate under-utilized federal spectrum for consumer use.</p><p>But speed is not the only value here. Getting the details right is equally paramount. The upcoming incentive auction for spectrum held by broadcasting companies, in particular, will be a complicated nine-bank billiard shot, and we have only one stroke of the cue to get it right.</p><h>How does Mobile Future believe those auctions should be structured?</h><p>n The one single thing government can do to ensure that the most sellers and bidders as possible come to the table quickly and enthusiastically is making certain that the auctions are designed to be open to all, and not weighted down with complicated restrictions in order to favor one outcome or another, or one competitor or another. Technology companies understand that to be most viable, they must design their products with the minimal number of attributes as possible. The Federal Communications Commission can learn from this principle when it comes to auction design.</p><h>What does Mobile Future see as the repercussions if more spectrum is not made available more quickly?</h><p>n We know that one of the greatest evolutions taking place is that we're not just connecting people across broadband devices, now we're connecting things. Billions of things. The Internet of Things is a reality, and it's only going to become a more profoundly important part of our lives. These are not necessarily smartphones. These are your car talking to the cloud. Your fridge talking to your supermarket. Your kid's glucose monitor talking to her endocrinologist's computer. For all of these innovations to continue to become realities requires more and more reliable access to spectrum.</p><h>So will consumers suffer most?</h><p>n It is not simply that we will all face the frustration of more dropped calls and more time staring at the infamous loading symbol of doom. Spectrum has become existentially important to our nation. Not having enough of it in the long term will have real and significant impacts on our nation's economic productivity, our competitiveness, our public safety, and the health and educational opportunities of our families and communities. Making more spectrum available is critical for thousands of mobile entrepreneurs developing new products and services that will continue to transform how we work, live and play.</p><h>Is it good that big tech firms are engaging with the government on issues such as surveillance, privacy and cybersecurity?</h><p>n Absolutely. The more stakeholders from the tech world of all kinds that can interact with, educate and learn from government, the better our policies will be, and the better our technologies will become.</p><p>I agree with what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said recently: We now live in a world of such rapid innovation that any law involving technology is likely to already be out of date by the moment it passed. By encouraging more open, transparent and fluid interaction between those who innovate and those who regulate and legislate, we all stand a better chance of ending up not just with better technology, more investment, and more innovation, but also with smarter rules and laws. </p><p>steven.overly@washpost.com</p><p>THE BIG IDEA</p><p>Federal agencies need to bring under-utilizedused spectrum to auction faster - and make those auctions transparent - if the wireless industry is going create innovative products that advance health, education and other areas of daily life.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-4c6a3e8e-9273-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BJ2-SK71-JBFW-C2H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 17, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002HR5</classCode><className>VIVENDI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>VIV (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>VIV (BIT)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He served in a number of government positions during the 1990s, including associate director and chief information officer of the U.S. Information Agency under <person><nameText>President Bill Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He's also been a businessman, holding executive positions at French media company Vivendi Universal, as well as serving in an assortment of policy and regulatory advisory groups in Washington and California. </p><p>Since 2008, Spalter has brought his government and business backgrounds to bear as the chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition of companies and nonprofit organizations with a key interest in policy that helps to advance mobile innovation.</p><p>           Why was Mobile Future formed?           </p><p>             n Often those who were regulating and legislating the industry could barely keep up with the turbo-charged pace at which the wireless industry was changing. We thought there was an opportunity to create a new platform for helping to educate policymakers about what was going on at the very edges of innovation in mobility and wireless, as well as an opportunity to make sure those who are out there innovating in the mobile wireless space have better vision of what's going on in the very important hallways and offices in Washington.</p><p>          One of your primary focus areas is spectrum, or the airwaves over which telecommunication companies move data. Why?          </p><p>             n The huge amount of data that consumers are using is an explosion of both opportunity but also demand on the networks. What's ultimately fueling that demand is the invisible resource of spectrum. It's managed by the government. The government owns most of it. Yet we're on this path to even more exciting chapters in the evolution of mobility and wireless, all of which will be based on increasing reliance on sustainable and secure access to spectrum.</p><p>We thought if we are going to continue to really enjoy and use these new innovations that are having such a sweeping impact on our businesses and lives, we really have to shine a bright, focused light on making sure the government is getting it right on spectrum management and spectrum policy.</p><p>          What should the government do to speed up the spectrum auction process?           </p><p>             n The good news is that our government now really gets it when it comes to understanding the need for speed in getting more spectrum into the marketplace. To continue this progress, it must make crafting an effective, open, transparent and simple auction design a key priority. It also must speed up the review process for secondary market transactions, and ensure federal government agencies do not drag their feet on achieving President Obama's goal to meaningfully reallocate under-utilized federal spectrum for consumer use. </p><p>                   But speed is not the only value here. Getting the details right is equally paramount. The upcoming incentive auction for spectrum held by broadcasting companies, in particular, will be a complicated nine-bank billiard shot, and we have only one stroke of the cue to get it right.</p><p>          How does Mobile Future believe those auctions should be structured?          </p><p>             n The one single thing government can do to ensure that the most sellers and bidders as possible come to the table quickly and enthusiastically is making certain that the auctions are designed to be open to all, and not weighted down with complicated restrictions in order to favor one outcome or another, or one competitor or another. Technology companies understand that to be most viable, they must design their products with the minimal number of attributes as possible. The Federal Communications Commission can learn from this principle when it comes to auction design. </p><p>          What does Mobile Future see as the repercussions if more spectrum is not made available more quickly?          </p><p>             n We know that one of the greatest evolutions taking place is that we're not just connecting people across broadband devices, now we're connecting things. Billions of things. The Internet of Things is a reality, and it's only going to become a more profoundly important part of our lives. These are not necessarily smartphones. These are your car talking to the cloud. Your fridge talking to your supermarket. Your kid's glucose monitor talking to her endocrinologist's computer. For all of these innovations to continue to become realities requires more and more reliable access to spectrum.</p><p>          So will consumers suffer most?          </p><p>             n It is not simply that we will all face the frustration of more dropped calls and more time staring at the infamous loading symbol of doom. Spectrum has become existentially important to our nation. Not having enough of it in the long term will have real and significant impacts on our nation's economic productivity, our competitiveness, our public safety, and the health and educational opportunities of our families and communities. Making more spectrum available is critical for thousands of mobile entrepreneurs developing new products and services that will continue to transform how we work, live and play. </p><p>          Is it good that big tech firms are engaging with the government on issues such as surveillance, privacy and cybersecurity?            </p><p>             n Absolutely. The more stakeholders from the tech world of all kinds that can interact with, educate and learn from government, the better our policies will be, and the better our technologies will become. </p><p>I agree with what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said recently: We now live in a world of such rapid innovation that any law involving technology is likely to already be out of date by the moment it passed. By encouraging more open, transparent and fluid interaction between those who innovate and those who regulate and legislate, we all stand a better chance of ending up not just with better technology, more investment, and more innovation, but also with smarter rules and laws. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:steven.overly@washpost.com\">steven.overly@washpost.com</email></p><p>THE BIG IDEA</p><p>Federal agencies need to bring under-utilizedused spectrum to auction faster - and make those auctions transparent - if the wireless industry is going create innovative products that advance health, education and other areas of daily life.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-4c6a3e8e927311e384e127626c5ef5fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BJ3-D3S1-DYX1-H2MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><timeReceived>8:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 17, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002HR5</classCode><className>VIVENDI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>VIV (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>VIV (BIT)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

For anyone who harbours doubts about Wall Street's current euphoria, Mr. Buffett offers an appealing alternative.</p><p>His company is flush with cash, ready to do deals and managed by smart people. Unlike the broad U.S. stock market, Berkshire does not depend on a handful of gigantic tech companies to propel its growth. If a downturn does come - and it always does - Mr. Buffett and Berkshire look like good candidates to prosper.</p><p>To be sure, the company has many critics. I know, because I was one for several years. So let me recite the usual complaints as we prepare for the Berkshire annual general meeting this Saturday.</p><p>The beefs start with two undeniable facts: Mr. Buffett is old and Berkshire is huge. No one knows how much longer the great man will be with us. What is certain is that a company of Berkshire's monumental scale has limited avenues for meaningful growth. A billion-dollar gain or loss barely registers any more for a company with US$700-billion in assets.</p><p>For this, and other reasons, meaningful gains are becoming harder to achieve. Some of Mr. Buffett's recent investments, such as his stakes in IBM and Kraft Heinz, have not panned out.</p><p>His well-known aversion to technology companies has also been a downer. During the past decade, as digital superstars such as Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have soared higher and higher, Berkshire has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500. It has gained 254 per cent since 2009, while the broad market has returned 313 per cent.</p><p>To make matters worse, Mr. Buffett has yet to name a successor and his company has sprawled in so many directions that it is nearly impossible to follow all its moving parts. For would-be investors, this raises an obvious question: Why not just buy an S&amp;P 500 index fund instead?</p><p>The answer hinges on the possibility of a market meltdown in the years ahead. Say what you will about Mr. Buffett's advanced years or Berkshire's unwieldy size, but there is something undeniably comforting about a company with more than US$100-billion in cash and cash-like investments on its balance sheet.</p><p>At this point in its evolution, Berkshire is not so much a traditional investment vehicle as a payday-loan company for businesses facing emergency needs for cash. If markets do seize up, and enterprises need to raise funds quickly, Berkshire will have the opportunity to drive some attractive deals, just as it did during the most recent financial crisis, when it agreed to buy US$5-billion in preferred shares from Goldman Sachs at an unusually generous dividend yield of 10 per cent.</p><p>To be sure, there is no guarantee that any new crisis is on its way. Even if one does come, Berkshire will face competition for deals from well-heeled rivals, such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and private-equity outfits. But Berkshire's unique ability is its capacity to move quickly, without the bureaucracy of many of its competitors.</p><p>It displayed that ability this past week when it agreed to fund Occidental Petroleum Corp. in its bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp.Occidental is attempting to fend off Chevron Corp., which has made its own offer for Anadarko, and it was willing to pay a hefty price for Berkshire's backing.</p><p>If Occidental's bid proves successful, Berkshire has agreed to buy US$10-billion of Occidental preferred shares. Mr. Buffett's company will earn an unusually lush 8-per-cent dividend yield on those preferreds. It will also gain warrants that would allow it purchase up to 80 million Occidental shares in a private offering at US$62.50 apiece. The deal appears to have remarkably little downside for Berkshire, but a lot of potential upside.</p><p>Similar opportunities are likely to emerge from time to time so long as Mr. Buffett is in charge. And when he leaves the scene? Berkshire shares will inevitably be hit hard. But there's no reason to think they will stay down. Their value ultimately rests on the company's dizzying ability to generate cash - which it does to the tune of US$100-million a day, with little direction from head office.</p><p>No matter who is in charge, Berkshire is unlikely to return to rapid growth given its huge size. But the big tech companies that have propelled Wall Street higher in recent years are also showing signs of slowing growth. While still expanding revenues at double-digit clips, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have all decelerated from their pace of a couple of a few years ago. Given their lofty valuations, it's not clear how much value they represent.</p><p>In contrast, Berkshire looks reasonably valued, well diversified and largely impervious to changes in technology or regulation. Like an old man in a ill-fitting suit, it won't bowl you over at first glance. But look more closely and you'll see a lot to like.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-berkshire-hathaways-a-payday-loan-company-for-businesses-facing/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-berkshire-hathaways-a-payday-loan-company-for-businesses-facing/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20190502ellipsis_KCV2L6HJVRBMNNJIYU5ZCYZADY</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1G-3S31-F072-J2XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><timeReceived>7:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The past 10 years in tech will be remembered for the way a handful of useful applications \u2014 shopping, searching, connecting with friends \u2014 turned into online empires.\u00a0</p><p>Along the way, each of them developed the attributes of a platform, drawing other companies to build applications on top of their digital foundations. Will this turn out to have been the high point for Big Tech? Or will the next decade see a consolidation of their power?</p><p>The companies formed around the new digital platforms are among the most creative in history. They have invented ways of working that have prevented much of the sclerosis that normally afflicts such huge organisations, and are still moving at impressive speed.</p><p>Inevitably, though, their vision is limited by their own success. They can\u2019t have all the best ideas themselves, and regulators now seem determined to stop them vacuuming up the start-ups that may represent the next generation of tech leaders. The sum of innovation happening elsewhere is usually greater. All it needs is the right environment for it to take root, and a strong enough need.</p><p>The need has become apparent during the backlash against Big Tech that set in three years ago. With sway over much of the world\u2019s political discourse, Facebook can\u2019t possibly police its network in a way that pleases everyone: No private corporation could. And the sheer financial might and ambition of the big tech companies loom over an increasing share of the economy. Once companies become this powerful they find it easy to confuse their own self-interest with the public good.</p><p>The issue is the environment in which they operate. Network effects, data amalgamation, and general consumer apathy (though the tech companies would no doubt call it satisfaction) have combined to make them look impregnable.</p><p>Regulators can go some way towards rectifying this by tackling anti-competitive behaviour. But in the history of computing, it has always taken a new paradigm \u2014 usually developed on the fringes of the tech landscape \u2014 to open the floodgates and bring in fresh competition and new thinking. That is how minicomputers and PCs weakened IBM\u2019s mainframe monopoly, and the internet circumvented Microsoft\u2019s PC software power.</p><p>So where might the disruptive tech forces rise up to make the next decade look different to the last? One possibility is at the edges of the network, thanks to falling costs and better connectivity. Against the centralised power of the giant computing \u201cclouds\u201d, this could foster a decentralisation that puts more processing \u2014 and control \u2014 of data into local hands.</p><p>Another possibility is a return to the forces of the early internet, where the network itself provided the open platform on which all could build equally. In such a world, data would be under the control of users, and services would interoperate in ways that let users pick whichever they like for a particular application, rather than allowing the creation of \u201cwalled gardens\u201d like Facebook.</p><p>Twitter\u2019s Bluesky project, announced earlier this month, is emblematic of this movement. The company said it wanted to hire five researchers to write protocols that support a new form of decentralised social media, where messages are exchanged between networks and user data stays under personal control.</p><p>\u201cDecentralisation\u201d has been the rallying cry for opponents of today\u2019s corporate tech power. It has, for instance, helped to drive the rise of cryptocurrencies, which at their heart are based on protocols that prevent any form of central authority. Meanwhile, Tim Berners-Lee, the British scientist who invented the world wide web, has been having another go, this time with a set of technology standards that would leave users with more control.</p><p>How, though, could open standards and protocols like these foster a new era of competition in tech, when billions of people have already entrusted their digital lives to a handful of giant companies?\u00a0</p><p>One possibility is that self-interest will lead Big Tech to move in this direction as a way to resolve problems caused by its own growing power, like Facebook\u2019s content moderation dilemma. But for some of the richest companies in history to willingly give up one of the main supports to their wealth seems unlikely.</p><p>That means that true innovation will have to start where it always has before: on the fringes, among the dreamers and the tinkerers who see the potential in a disruptive new tech force. It will take a combination of innovative young companies, idealists like Mr Berners-Lee, and opportunists and radicals like the people behind the crypto movement to show they can create a true alternative.</p><p>At the start of a new decade and with Big Tech in the ascendant, that may be the best hope for a return of real disruption.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:richard.waters@ft.com\">richard.waters@ft.com</email></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-098d8052280011ea9a4f963f0ec7e134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV6-F1Y1-DXP9-928M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shutdown looming -- lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to  keep the government funded.  One major hurdle: the battle over immigration  reform.  Republicans did little to close the gap last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The general consensus tonight was that there is not  support for the current leadership plan as proposed.  I think no one wants  to shutdown.  I think none of us, myself included, wants to shut down the  government.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The looming threat coming as stocks hit near record territory.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday cracked 26000 but it ended the  day lower, below the milestone.  After that the markets closed as you see  fractionally lower.   It was the second highest close in history however,  even with the decline.</p><p>Futures this morning back in the green -- take a look.  We are expecting a  big open for the broader averages with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up  145 points right now, one-half of 1 percent higher.  Nasdaq is up 25 --  that's a third of a percent higher as earnings drive the day.</p><p>It is the season of fourth quarter numbers.  Bank of America just hit the  tape.  Earnings of B of A are 47 cents a share, topped expectations.   Revenue however was a slight miss.  But the company said it took a nearly  $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to write off assets due to the tax  reform bill.</p><p>We are waiting for the numbers from Goldman Sachs.  As you can see B of A  and Goldman Sachs shares this morning are higher.  As soon as the Goldman  Sachs numbers hit the tape, we'll bring them to you.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a bit of a pull back.  FT 100 down a quarter of a  percent as is the DAX index.  The CAC 40 it's just fractionally lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed with the Shanghai composite up a  quarter of a percent and the Hang Seng also higher by a quarter of a  percent in Hong Kong.</p><p>Flu season epidemic -- the vast number of cases overwhelming emergency  rooms across the country.  One hospital in California even forced to set up  a makeshift treatment center in the parking lot to deal with the massive  overcrowding caused by the flu.</p><p>One healthy place in the U.S., 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that's for sure.   The White House doctor says that President Trump is in good health.  But  that wasn't enough for the mainstream media.  The unbelievable questions  and the outrage coming up from the press looking for any weaknesses and the  doctor said the President is in excellent shape.</p><p>Plus could technology titans soon face anti-trust concerns?  The surprising  headwinds the likes of Facebook and Apple could be facing.</p><p>Plus this deal is anything but Butterfingers.  We've got a look at Nestle's  deal to sell its chocolate business for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down, the founder of Bold Carrie Sheffield is here, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  It's awesome to be here.  I'm so glad we got  to report on Bank of America because we're going to see what happens out of  Goldman Sachs.  It's actually expected that -- their revenues and net  earnings are going to be down 5 percent.  And they had problems in an area  they dominated which is fixed income currencies and commodities.</p><p>So their fixed income department has had a hard time last year.  Let's see  what happens to this.  I mean it's the diverging results coming from the  banks especially, you know, titans like Goldman Sachs -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Goldman has had a hard time -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- in being dominant period. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it's pretty interesting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll follow that.  It was the case at one point as the  banks go, so goes the rest of the market.  But this whole market has been  so broad-based in terms of the rallies.  So we'll see what happens with the  banks this morning.  Longer term they certainly looking optimistic.  </p><p>Coming up this morning former CKE Restaurant CEO Andy Puzder is with us;  former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will join us; Fox News  senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; family medicine  physician Dr. Mike is here; and the CEO of Cadre Ryan Williams will join us  as well.</p><p>Big unicorn there.  You don't want to miss a moment of it.  </p><p>But first this, Republicans are on a deadlock on the government spending  fix as Congress barrels toward the Friday budget deadline.</p><p>The impasse comes after House leaders proposed a new short-term strategy  that would fund the government through February 16 while allowing more time  for negotiations on DACA.</p><p>But conservative Republicans are pushing for a deal that includes more  funding for the Pentagon and revealed last night that the GOP leadership  does not have the votes to pass a government funding bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  Democrats are making an untenable demand  where they're putting illegal aliens above the interest of national  security.</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  There is not support for the  current leadership plan as proposed at this point.  There are two or three  options that are out there.  We're going to have to have discussions with  our leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile a bipartisan group of lawmakers are set to unveil a  new DACA bill today.  I want to bring in White House director of  legislative affairs, Marc Short.</p><p>Marc -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  Maria -- thanks  for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we on this?  Can you give us a status check?  </p><p>SHORT:  On the spending bill and DACA -- that's how they are tied together.   It's what we have had this week, it's an expectation of Thursday, Friday  vote on another continuing resolution -- Maria, that would get us into  February to allow more time for DACA and its conversations.</p><p>We met at a staff level with the staff from Leader McCarthy, Leader Hoyer,  Leader Cornyn as well as Senator Durbin yesterday.  I think there will be a  principles' meeting today in which those members will be joined by General  Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen from DHS to continue conversations to move  forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the Freedom Caucus go along with that?  Even though we  just heard Mark Meadows say look, we're not in favor of the leadership plan  here.</p><p>SHORT:  Maria -- we understand the frustration.  Keep in mind that we  submit a budget to Congress in February for 2018.  Mick Mulvaney, OMB  director is about to submit a budget in just a couple of weeks for 2019.   And yet we still haven't funded 2018 to date.</p><p>So we submit our budget in February.  Congress should have a bill completed  by September 30 at the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>Here we are now in mid-January still not having a funding bill for 2018  which is why we are continued to force to do these continuing resolutions  because nobody wants a shutdown.  That hurts federal workers and it hurts  our Defense Department, it hurts our military.  And we need to make sure  that we're continuing to fund our troops.</p><p>The Democrat position has been and continues to be we are going to shut  down the government, stop paying our troops unless there's a deal for  illegal aliens in place.  We are trying to get a deal to solve the DACA  problem but we don't want to shut down the government.</p><p>We think that we'll end up getting that passed this weak to buy us another  month but we're all frustrated -- Maria.  This is not the way Congress is  supposed to work.  They're supposed to have a funding bill completed by  September 30.  We're now in mid-January.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And you're absolutely right.  I mean you're basically  being held hostage and running the government every two weeks. </p><p>SHORT:  That's right.  It's not the way to run the government.  And the  biggest concern is frankly on the national security level.  Secretary  Mattis has continued to go and talk, not just to Republican leaders but  also the Democrat leaders and Schumer and Pelosi and say what you're doing  is tying my hands.  We cannot make the necessary planning that I need to  help make sure our country is secure and safe.  And you're putting our  troops' funding in jeopardy.  And it's a real national security risk for  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do you get that communicated to the American people?  I  mean we recognize the threats that are out there in terms of national  security for this country.</p><p>And we also recognize that the Democrats would like the government to shut  down because they believe that Republicans will be blamed.</p><p>SHORT:  There is a sense that if Republicans control the House, the Senate  and the White House they'll get blamed.  But the reality is that Democrats,  we need 60 votes in the United States senate.  The Democrats are the ones  that have a lot of power here and they are, as you say, holding American  people and the government hostage in order to get demands that they want on  DACA.</p><p>And when you talk about national security, Maria, something that was lost I  think in all the conversation, all the soap opera drama the last couple of  days, a report that came out that said three out of four terrorists  convicted here in the United States are foreign born.</p><p>But something else is as in that report that was missing.  Over 2,500  people every year on the terror watch list try to get into our country.   That is seven per day.</p><p>So here we are having all this drama and discussion about what he said, she  said.  And we're not focused on the reality that there are terrorists  trying to get into our country every day and we are trying to fix chain  migration and the lottery visa program to make sure our country is safe and  secure.</p><p>Seven everyday are apprehended or turned away from trying to come in.   Seven people on the FBI's terror watch list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a pretty incredible number actually.  But you're also  facing a group where they would prefer the government to shut down because  they don't want the legislative agenda to get executed, isn't that right?</p><p>SHORT:  Well, I think we're going to find that out this week.  Those are  questions on whether or not they really want a government shutdown or they  just think that they can bluff to try to get people to cave to their  demands on DACA.</p><p>And so we're going to find out this week because I think in reality  Republicans will end up holding together in making sure that we're given  more time to continue negotiate and we avoid a shutdown.</p><p>But again, this is no way to run a government.  We continue to do this  every couple of weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SHORT:  The administration submitted a budget in February of 2017 and here  we are again in mid-January without funding for 2018, much less beginning  in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's talk about the broader agenda -- Marc.  This is the  -- an anniversary week for the President, the first year in office under  his belt.  What are the priorities for '18?</p><p>SHORT:  Well, Maria -- I think that we are going to take time to review  2017 because of it was historic in so many ways.  But 2018 also will  feature an infrastructure plan that the President will probably unveil  closer to the State of the Union.  As well as continue to move forward in  areas to rollback the regulatory state and look to require work  requirements in some of the Medicaid payments as you've seen that HHS has  already unveiled.</p><p>So those will continue to be priorities for the administration.  But we  want to secure the border.  We want to make sure our troops are funded.   And we want to get this government funded.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the while, Democrats have been saying that they want  infrastructure.  Reports say that the President will actually present an  infrastructure plan during the State of the Union.  Do you have plans to  tout an infrastructure plan for the State of the Union?</p><p>SHORT:  There are plans for that.  The President has a plan in place; it's  a matter of timing.  We will continue to have conversations with Congress.   Our team at NEC has been doing that for the last few weeks and they'll  continue to over the next couple of weeks leading up to the State of the  Union to make sure they're fully briefed on what the plan will be.</p><p>But you should look for the President to unveil that closer to the State of  the Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems like, you know, on the left, the whole point in all of  the decisions is to win the 2018 -- win as many seats as they can in the  2018 elections.  I mean that's what they're going for and that's why the  obstruction is probably only going to pick up.</p><p>SHORT:  Well, I think you're right.  This is an election year and so there  will be a lot more obstruction and probably the expectations for what we  can do legislatively will diminish as the year goes along.</p><p>We have a lot of plans to begin the year.  But to your point, Democrats  will have to make a case as to why not -- not one of them voted for tax  relief that now 2.1 million Americans now -- 2.1 million workers have  either received a bonus or a pay increase since the tax release -- since  the tax package was passed just a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>There will continue to be more.  And they will have to explain why  unemployment in America is at its lowest point ever for African-Americans,  lowest point ever for Hispanic Americans -- a 17-year-low, and yet they are  stopping the economic plans of this administration.</p><p>So we look forward to that debate coming forth throughout the rest of year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what is the biggest pushback from the left?  Is it funding  the border wall?  Giving the President the money that he is asking for?  Or  is it funding the military?</p><p>SHORT:  That's a great question -- Maria.  I think the reality is that on  the border security, keep in mind in 2006 most Democrats voted for the  Secure Fence Act that would have funded the wall including Chuck Schumer.</p><p>In 2013, over $40 billion was in the Democrat plan on part of their Dream  Act to provide border security.  So they have been willing to vote for it  before.  The only difference now is that Donald Trump is president.</p><p>So in my mind, it's less of a policy issue and purely a political issue  where there is a recognition of the security needs but for political  reasons looking to hold back support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of the conversation around the President's personality  and his remarks -- is that getting in the way in terms of doing a deal?  Or  is that just noise coming from the left.</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.  I think it's a lot of noise, frankly Maria.  I think that the  conversations yesterday were cordial.  I think that we'll have, hopefully  continued progress but keep in mind the administration put forward our  principles and what we want on this plan back in October.</p><p>Again we're in mid-January.  We refined that plan a couple of weeks ago and  took some things off the table to try to get closer to negotiations.  So  we've been leaning forward into this.</p><p>We're anxious for Congress to come back and say, ok these are reasonable  things you're asking for -- end of the visa lottery program which as you  know, was a program in which the pipe bomber came in.  End the chain  migration which as you know, is the program through which the terrorist who  ran over people in New York came through.</p><p>And begin to secure the border.  Those are practical requests for the  American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean are you getting at least an acknowledgement that the  visa program is ridiculous?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that -- I think there's a growing consensus that the visa  program is ridiculous, as you say.  I think the question is the Democrat  position has been, let's take those visas and reallocate them to other  programs like the temporary protected status program.  Or they think the  administration just believes that program should be terminated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc -- thanks so much for walking us through it all.  Great  insights from you.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>SHORT:  Thanks -- Maria.  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching the developments.  Marc Short at the White  House. </p><p>Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health -- reporters  poke and prod at President Trump's glowing physical exam report yesterday.   The bizarre questions that embarrassed the entire media for the White House  doctor -- coming up.</p><p>And then a bittersweet parting -- Nestle offloading its candy business to  an Italian chocolate giant for nearly $3 billion; why the deal could signal  a new future for Nestle.</p><p>Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   I'm Cheryl Casone with your headlines. </p><p>Two Navy commanders facing negligent homicide charges related to the deadly  crash of two different ships last year.  They are former Commander Bryce  Benson of the USS Fitzgerald and former Commander Alfredo Sanchez of the  USS John McCain.</p><p>The Fitzgerald collided with a commercial ship near Japan in June.  That  killed seven sailors.  Ten were killed in August when the John s. McCain  crashed into an oil tanker.  This happened in Southeast Asia.</p><p>The story we're following for you this morning.  McDonald's is pledging to  have fully recyclable packaging by 2025.  The fast food chain also said  that recycling bins are going to be put in all of its restaurants.  Today  about half of McDonald's packaging comes from renewable, recyclable,  certified material.</p><p>Taking a look at the stocks -- shares of McDonald's restaurant up nearly 40  percent over the last year.</p><p>And then listen to this.  Nestle is selling its U.S. candy business to  Italy's Ferrero for about $2.8 billion in cash.  The brands being sold  include Butterfinger, Crunch and Runts -- all the good stuff, right.</p><p>The deal is going to make the Ferrero the third largest candy maker in the  United States.  Some analysts say that the move by Nestle is going to help  it focus more on healthier products.  They've actually been trying to do  that -- Maria.  </p><p>Shares of Nestle, up about 15 percent from a year ago.</p><p>All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the good stuff.</p><p>CASONE:  It's all the good stuff, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Like nothing better happen to my Butterfingers.  (INAUDIBLE) the  Butterfinger ice creams that are made of.  There is a healthy ecosystem off  of all those delicious candy.</p><p>M1:  You want the healthy Butterfinger.  That's why -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nobody.</p><p>M1:  Nobody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  There's no indication whatsoever  that he has any cognitive issues.  You know, he's very sharp and you know,  he's very articulate when he speaks to me.  I found no reason whatsoever to  think that the President has any issues whatsoever with his thought  process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media embarrassed itself yesterday.  Reporters poking and  prodding at President Trump's glowing physical exam report.  The bizarre  questions to the White House doctor -- next.</p><p>Then a Netflix for luxury cars -- BMW and Mercedes Benz, both reportedly  rolling out subscription services for a hassle-free ride.  We'll take you  under the hood of the new plan.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Wow, what a flu season.  The deadly flu season could get even worse.  The  severity of the virus is overwhelming emergency rooms across the country.   At least 20 children have died as a result.</p><p>Hospitals in California have begun turning their parking lots into  makeshift treatment centers to deal with the massive overcrowding caused by  flu patients.</p><p>Joining us right now is family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, better  known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike -- good to see you.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And I told you during the  break I'm just back because I had a really bad cold.  It's not the flu but  I was afraid because the flu is seriously dangerous this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Very, very dangerous.  The flu is dangerous all seasons  actually.  We always forget when a year goes by that the last flu season  wasn't so bad. </p><p>But the flu does kill.  It's a deadly virus.  Even those who get it and  don't die from it they are out of work for a week, two weeks because of  high fevers, body aches, severe fatigue.</p><p>It's not a virus that's just like the common cold that goes away after a  few days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you do about it?  Do you just do Tamiflu?  What do you  do about it?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, Tamiflu is a great anti-viral and it's best taken within  the first 48 hours of having the symptoms.  That's why I always recommend a  senior doctor right away when the symptoms do start.</p><p>Although there has been some promise with taking Tamiflu after the 48  hours.  That can reduce the complication rate with does kill people in very  severe populations that are susceptible -- thinking over the age of 65,  under the age of five.</p><p>KELLY:  So I guess the main question is should people be getting flu shots?   Did the flu shot actually work this season?  Because we are guessing at  what strains and cultures it actually is going to be here -- I like that.   So is the flu shot even worth it this year?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So the flu shot is definitely worth it.  There has been a lot  of excitement because initially, the way we decide if the flu shots can be  effective in prediction, we look at Australia.  Because they're in the  southern hemisphere, they experience their flu season before ours.</p><p>Their flu shot was only about 10 percent effective for the current strain  that we have.  The current strain is an H3N2 strain.  It means absolutely  nothing to the regular person but to scientists we get excited about it.</p><p>And what we found is the current flu shot is about 30 percent effective; 30  percent effective -- still very much worth getting.  And even if it doesn't  prevent you from getting the flu, it will tone down your symptoms, it will  shorten the course.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And what we've seen is over time, if you consistently yearly  get flu shots it works even more effectively.</p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD:  Does the weather have any impact because  for me, you know, the snowstorm has been crazy.  I got cold.  I felt like  that affected my immune system.</p><p>Are you saying that like the weather pattern is affecting it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so cold this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  There is a couple of things that come from that.  When  it's cold, generated humidity -- the humidity is lower so germs hang around  longer in the air.  So someone can sneeze in a conference room, an hour  later you walk in those germs are still hanging around.</p><p>Also because it's cold everyone is staying inside.  We are closer together.   So if one person gets sick it spreads that much quicker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Constantly washing your hands is really important.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Washing your hands and not touching your face.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the President's health.  The White House  doctor said that commander in chief is in good health but that was not  enough for the mainstream media.</p><p>Watch this charade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Does the President wear dentures.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you looking at things like early onset  Alzheimer's?  Are you looking at dementia like some -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy  reasons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  His weight I think is at 239, right.  That -- it  seems it's just shy of obesity.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're confident of that number and -- </p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- and did you do any measurements.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Recently where the President appeared to slur his  words while giving an address.  Did you look into what the cause of that  might have been at all?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could not believe this yesterday.  I tweeted out in the  middle of it, \"No words.\"  No words.  I was embarrassed for my industry.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  All of the things going on -- all the things going on in the  country, that's what they're dealing with.  And he weighs 239; I hadn't  weighed that since I was 17.  I should be dead by now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were upset that the President -- there wasn't anything bad  to report.  I mean they were -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  He's never -- he doesn't drink.  He doesn't smoke.  He doesn't  do drugs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the doctor said a lifetime of no alcohol and no tobacco  really has served him incredibly well.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Well, they're talking about the 25th amendment because they're  obsessed.  They think that the President is not going to make it through  his first term and he's not going to run for reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, not only do they think but they're definitely creating  that narrative.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Oh yes.  I call it the 50 states of impeachment fantasy where  they just have all these scenarios that they think that he just won't make  it.  And he's going to be impeached because of his health.</p><p>So that's why they're doing this.  It's just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as a medical doctor.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me.  I see a lot of people critiquing  someone's health before they know exactly what's going on, especially from  the mental health side.  In order to know anything about someone's mental  health, you need to sit down with them.  You need to have a conversation  with them.  You need to talk about their family history.</p><p>So to see some journalists and even doctors come on and say I know that  this person has x illness.  That is medically unethical.  You are doing a  disservice to yourself.  You're doing a disservice to your patients because  you're proving that you don't follow the medical process.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is it hard to measure mental health if you don't have a  baseline?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  It's hard to measure mental health when you haven't  interviewed and sat down with the person.  It's impossible.  You can't do  it.  You have to spend time.  They have to be your patient otherwise you're  just making stuff up.</p><p>KELLY:  There's nothing wrong with dentures, by the way, people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  George Washington, right.</p><p>But I mean have you ever seen anything like that? I mean President Obama  was a huge smoker.  There was no comments about it.  No one said anything.</p><p>I mean President Bush also had issues.  Have you ever seen anything like  that yesterday?  It was extraordinary.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it was pretty bad.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Look at how many heavy drinkers we had.  Look at all the -- I  know the President said the (INAUDIBLE) was on.  We've had -- President  Trump might be one of the more saner presidents we've had.  Look at -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- trying to propagate because he's drunk.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  It's just very -- it's this very narrative.  Ever since, you  know, he won they have this agenda where they want to obstruct in every way  possible.  So that's -- this is just par for the course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you -- Mr. President.  Congratulations on excellent  health.  </p><p>Dr. Mike -- good to see you, sir.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, the DACA dispute -- the Department of Justice go straight to the  Supreme Court over a ruling to block President Trump from ending the Obama- era program that protects illegal immigrants who entered the country as  children.</p><p>The very latest in the legal battle on DACA coming up.</p><p>And then is it time for tech titans trust buster.  We'll take a look at  whether the industry's biggest names have gotten too big.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 17th; your top stories right  now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Border battle, Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen pushing the  administration's position on Immigration including sanctuary cities.  She  warned that leaders in those cities could face prosecution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The  Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. </p><p>The context of this is of course not only putting my ICE officers at risk  but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our Immigration  laws.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>A closer look at the Immigration fight on Capitol Hill as Democrats  including Cory Booker put on a show yesterday to try to slam the president;  the outrage coming up.</p><p>Earnings season in focus on Wall Street.  Goldman Sachs set to report  momentarily after Bank of America reported mixed results, we'll have those  numbers for you as soon as they hit the tape; Goldman shares are up ahead  of the numbers.</p><p>Markets this morning rallying, take a look at Futures indicating a big move  at the start of trading this morning up 140 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial Average, that's one half of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up 23,  that's a third of a percent higher as is the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>After a wild session yesterday on Wall Street, the Dow hitting 26,000,  seven days after a 25,000 but then by the close it erased all the gains as  the session wore on and went negative.</p><p>Overseas action this morning in Europe, looks weak.  As you see the FT 100  down a quarter of a percent.  The CAC krone and the DAX Index also weaker.   I should point out this is well off of the lows of the morning so we're  seeing a bit of a comeback in Europe right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed as you see there.</p><p>A new law could prevent your ability to travel overseas, how you could lose  your passport over late taxes.</p><p>And cracking down on big Tech, a look at the possible antitrust push on  companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, something we've been expecting  here on this program.</p><p>Luxury for less, BMW and Mercedes Benz, the latest automakers to test a  subscription service.</p><p>Plus, Senator Orrin Hatch puts on a spectacle, how his invisible glasses  went viral.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the legal dispute over DACA.   The Department of Justice asking for the Supreme Court to immediately  review a federal judge's ruling that blocked President Trump from ending  the program.  Last week a district judge ordered the administration to  continue protecting immigrants who entered the country illegally as  children.</p><p>In a statement yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Session said this, \"It  defies both law and common sense for DACA --  to somehow be mandated  nationwide by a single District Court in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge we keep asking the same question -- </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- why is the Ninth Court is so influential in the whole  country?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The Ninth Circuit, because the president's opponents filed  their complaints in California since they know that an overwhelming  majority of federal judges there are likely to resist the president.</p><p>So, there's a couple of questions here, one, was a federal judge in  California authorized to restrain the president nationwide?</p><p>The answer, \"Yes.\"</p><p>Now that is a rarely exercised a power, usually you restrain the president  or you restrain the defendant just in the area where you sit but when the  defendant or his agents are present nationwide and you believe the  defendant is engaging in unconstitutional behavior, which is what this  judge found -- I don't agree with him but did he have the authority to  enjoin the president?</p><p>He did.</p><p>Then the president said, \"We have to make these laws based on love and I'm  going to let DACA stay in place.\"</p><p>Then the president's lawyers advised him, 'if you don't appeal this, you  are sending the wrong signal to the court that maybe you really are  ambivalent about exercising these powers.'</p><p>So, they filed the appeal yesterday.  They bypassed your - at least  favorite circuit court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and went  directly to the Supreme Court; that is very rare and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- 99 percent of the time you do that the Supreme Court says,  \"Go to the Circuit Court first,\" but on every, single, without fail,  Immigration case that has started at California Federal District Court and  gone to the Ninth Circuit, and gone to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court  has reversed the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>So, the Justice Department is saying, we want to go to you directly because  we need an answer right away -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- I can't predict what the Supreme Court is going to do.</p><p>KELLY:  Well when is the Supreme Court going to hear this and decide on  this (ph)?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Entirely up to them -- </p><p>KELLY:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Kevin.</p><p>If it had gone to the Ninth Circuit they have a short window in which to  rule but because it goes to the Supremes, they can sit in it for as long as  they want.</p><p>In the meantime, the federal district judge's order stays in place and if  you are in this category of 800,000 -- of pretty much Americanized people  but born in another country and came here as babies, you can apply for the  DACA protection.</p><p>Now that DACA protection is for a year.  If you apply and get it then it's  another year before the president can invalidate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to get to a couple of different issues because we also want  to talk about 'sanctuary cities' with the Judge but first this, an  Oversight Hearing on Border Security took a real turn yesterday and we want  to get your take.</p><p>Senators began grilling DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over her role in  last week's White House Immigration meeting.</p><p>New Jersey Democrat, Cory Booker hit her especially hard, yelling at her  after she said she did not recall President Trump's vulgar language  reportedly used during the meeting.</p><p>Watch this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. COREY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY:  Your silence and your amnesia is  complicity.  I don't know is 73 percent of your time is spent concerned  about the people in fear in communities in this country.</p><p>I hurt.</p><p>When Dick Durbin called me, I had tears of rage when I heard about this  experience in that meeting and for you not to feel that hurt, and that  pain, and to dismiss some of the questions of my colleagues, saying, \"I've  already answered that line of questions,\" when tens of millions of  Americans are hurting right now because of what they're worried about what  happened in the White House.</p><p>That's unacceptable to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Goldman Sachs numbers are out, we're going to get them in a  minute; they are better than expected.</p><p>Judge, who did he think he was talking to?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He was (ph) -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Talking to the secretary of Homeland Security?  Putting on a  show like that, that was outrageous.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- he was talking to his political base in New Jersey and I  think it probably resonated with them.</p><p>I've known Senator -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Booker -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- outrageous.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- for many, many, years and this is the way he is.</p><p>It was over the top.  It was loud.  It was disrespectful but this is what  happens occasionally when cabinet members clash with a member of Congress  in the - in the opposite party.</p><p>I'm not surprised to see it, that's the way he operates.  He assures  himself of reelection with his base in -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- New Jersey -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in an era where you have men behaving badly and all of this  harassment going on, to speak to a professional woman, and she's sitting  there and he's yelling at her, like she did something was - it just  terrible.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, she burst the bubble with just one or two words,  which might have followed his ranting and raving, something like you know,  \"I'm trying to answer your questions.  I didn't come here for that,\" which  is pretty bold of a person to say to a senator.</p><p>Under the law she does have to answer to that Committee.</p><p>She doesn't have to tolerate that behavior -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She didn't have to tolerate -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO: Was he harassing her?</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Oh, absolutely.

They're new, you've probably never heard of them.\"</p><p>I hope everybody gets the joke.</p><p>The 30-second video by the way racked up about 5 million views already so  it's all over YouTube and Facebook.  It's just funny Maria, like, 'Oh, my  glasses -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's cute.</p><p>CASONE:  -- that I'm not wearing.'</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>It's sort of like when you're like, 'where are my glasses, where are my  glasses?'  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They are on your head.</p><p>CASONE:  On your head, yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Are they are going to test (ph) Senator Hatch for his mental  stability now, that he's taking off fake glasses - - </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Well you know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- he's retiring.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the doctor in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a press conference going.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- back in a -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I've covered -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- press conference.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- since 2003, I'm from Utah so I used to cover him as a  college student and I love him but I think most of Utah agrees it was time  for him to go.</p><p>I mean he's just the longest-serving Republican senator, it's time for him  to go.</p><p>But what I'm worried about is this - and I love Romney but I just think the  civil war between the Trump versus you know, 'never Trump' people, it's -  this civil war has got to end and that's what I'm worried about with  Romney.</p><p>As much as I love Mitt Romney, some reporters are saying that Jon Huntsman  actually might get into the fray -- </p><p>KELLY:  The Republicans -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- to come out -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was a 'never Trumper,' I mean there's no doubt about it,  Romney?</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- Right, we're -- </p><p>KELLY:  -- Republicans have everything, it's like '86 Bears (ph) right now,  'What can go wrong?  OK, well maybe Dick and Buddy Ryan gets into a fight.'</p><p>That's what goes wrong.</p><p>Republicans won everything and they are spending their time fighting with  each other, 'self-sabotage.'</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's a good point.</p><p>Coming up today's Technology titans, are they too powerful.  We're  unpacking the antitrust argument against Facebook, Google, and Amazon,  among others.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Dominating giant technology companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon,  raising the question, 'should they be broken up?'</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and of course the questions -- </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- are 'broken-up' or are they needing more governance or what?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You break them up, you regulate them, what do you do?</p><p>It's a fascinating question and the Wall Street Journal did an excellent  and a very deep-dive on this.</p><p>Basically, they compared the Tech giants of today to those of the last  century so first they looked at the share size, the influence of these  companies.</p><p>Just check it out 95 percent of young adults today use Facebook; 89 percent  use Google to search the Web; 75 percent use Amazon to buy e-books.</p><p>Let's compare that to back when, nine and 10 of us made phone calls using  AT&amp;T and got our fuel from Standard Oil.</p><p>So, many people want to know how these companies through the ages have  gotten so big and as far as that antitrust regulator argument, does the  size help or hurt you and me as the consumer.</p><p>So, let's take a look, back in the day, John D. Rockefeller and Standard  Oil.  He either bought other smaller refineries or drove them out of  business to become so large and in the process managed to keep oil prices,  kerosene mostly, low.</p><p>Standard Oil ruled in a legal monopoly back in 1911.</p><p>So, today as we've also seen, Facebook is buying competition: Instagram;  WhatsApp; Oculus VR.  Its services are mostly free for you and me and they  are constantly evolving themselves to make the product better.</p><p>So, it's hard to prove at least from that monopoly point of view that their  services are harmful to the - to the consumer.</p><p>You can look at the addictive nature of the products, that's another  argument altogether.</p><p>Let's look at Amazon, it bought Staples; it bought Whole Foods, not even a  competitor, still managing to keep prices low.</p><p>Alphabet probably coming under the heaviest scrutiny here, paying billions  and billions of dollars in fines to European and US regulators for the way  they populate their search results which can often hurt their rival, the  competition.</p><p>These companies nonetheless and we're going to pull up a chart, they have  made investors wealthy but 2018 is going to offer a new test especially as  we look at these creative tie-ups: vertical mergers, when you don't buy  direct; competitor and we'll see that in March as AT&amp;T continues to try to  you know, merge with Time Warner.</p><p>Is it possible?</p><p>What is the government going to say?</p><p>And how do you regulate companies that have invaded our lives?</p><p>KELLY:  Well the biggest issue that you're seeing is on Facebook  (INAUDIBLE), right (ph), they were basically a media company, there were -  you could pay them in rubles -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- to push a story to - about whatever candidate you wanted.</p><p>And guess what?</p><p>Fox isn't held to the - to the same - Fox has standards, right, you have to  decide where you're getting your -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- information from, how and you know -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- the publishers need to be vetted.</p><p>Facebook certainly didn't do that and they certainly undermined democracy  by doing this.</p><p>They didn't vet.  They took it everywhere, even the Germans took action  against Facebook because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- there's one more thing - and there's one more thing and that  is the data that these companies have about us, they know everything.</p><p>Well I mean Google -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they obviously know everything that we're searching for -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You looked -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- so that's sweater so let me show you this one, oh -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- this happens to be one of our sites that sells it (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, much data, that's why they're so powerful.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I think there's also the issue of bias so I work with an  organization called \"Lincoln Network\" in Silicon Valley which is  Libertarian conservatives in Silicon Valley and they have just looked at  surveys talking to conservatives and libertarians in Silicon Valley and the  level of bias that these employees feel in the Valley, they can't speak up.</p><p>And you also see conservative publications and conservative media outlets  getting censored or even you know, a Congresswoman tried to put up a pro- life ad on Twitter, it was - and it was shot down.</p><p>The same thing that you're seeing in Google and Facebook.</p><p>This is a big question as it relates to the First Amendment and Freedom of  Speech and also just the ability to express yourself ideologically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But it doesn't seem like it's a fair comparison to compare this  to Rockefeller, I mean Google laying those three underground cables across  the ocean at -- 10 times as -- 10 million times as fast as a modem, worries  you about them taking over the Internet but Rockefeller you had no option  with Standard Oil.</p><p>You had to buy oil from him, Carnegie, you had -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because he bought -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- to buy it still from him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- everybody else.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Because he bought everybody else and to this day and age,  (they've got) a kid in a garage somewhere in Silicon Valley could take down  Google theoretically -- </p><p>KELLY:  Not really -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  -- because they'll clamp-down -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- did not have -- </p><p>KELLY:  -- either you sell -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  -- or we'll - we'll wipe you out, you can't buy this.  That's what  happened -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Yes.  That's -- </p><p>KELLY:  -- to Snapshot and Instagram.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- maybe that's - well that's what happened in MySpace.</p><p>MySpace offers the same thing and all of a sudden, they come along, \"Hey,  we all thought the same thing.\"</p><p>Look at that merger, I mean people would have thought the same thing,  Technology is increasing so rapidly -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  It is true -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- it is not like the -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- and there's also the barriers to entry are much lower than  Standard Oil will you have to have massive physical assets.</p><p>You can do so much in your basement with almost nothing.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And we don't have -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Teddy Roosevelt -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- to go after these guys like they had back then.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Lauren it's worth watching and I know the stocks will  also get impacted -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we do see a bigger government in Tech.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>Thank you Lauren Simonetti.</p><p>Apocalypse now, one graphic artist imagines what it would look like if the  technology giants, Facebook and Google face the same fate as some  retailers.</p><p>Next hour, right here on Mornings with Maria; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 17th; your top stories right  now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Shut down showdown, lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to  keep the government funded.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Shutdown looming -- lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to  keep the government funded.  One major hurdle: the battle over immigration  reform.  Republicans did little to close the gap last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The general consensus tonight was that there is not  support for the current leadership plan as proposed.  I think no one wants  to shutdown.  I think none of us, myself included, wants to shut down the  government.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The looming threat coming as stocks hit near record territory.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday cracked 26000 but it ended the  day lower, below the milestone.  After that the markets closed as you see  fractionally lower.   It was the second highest close in history however,  even with the decline.</p><p> Futures this morning back in the green -- take a look.  We are expecting a  big open for the broader averages with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up  145 points right now, one-half of 1 percent higher.  Nasdaq is up 25 --  that's a third of a percent higher as earnings drive the day.</p><p> It is the season of fourth quarter numbers.  Bank of America just hit the  tape.  Earnings of B of A are 47 cents a share, topped expectations.   Revenue however was a slight miss.  But the company said it took a nearly  $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to write off assets due to the tax  reform bill.</p><p> We are waiting for the numbers from Goldman Sachs.  As you can see B of A  and Goldman Sachs shares this morning are higher.  As soon as the Goldman  Sachs numbers hit the tape, we'll bring them to you.</p><p> In Europe this morning, a bit of a pull back.  FT 100 down a quarter of a  percent as is the DAX index.  The CAC 40 it's just fractionally lower.</p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed with the Shanghai composite up a  quarter of a percent and the Hang Seng also higher by a quarter of a  percent in Hong Kong.</p><p> Flu season epidemic -- the vast number of cases overwhelming emergency  rooms across the country.  One hospital in California even forced to set up  a makeshift treatment center in the parking lot to deal with the massive  overcrowding caused by the flu.</p><p> One healthy place in the U.S., 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that's for sure.   The White House doctor says that President Trump is in good health.  But  that wasn't enough for the mainstream media.  The unbelievable questions  and the outrage coming up from the press looking for any weaknesses and the  doctor said the President is in excellent shape.</p><p> Plus could technology titans soon face anti-trust concerns?  The surprising  headwinds the likes of Facebook and Apple could be facing.</p><p> Plus this deal is anything but Butterfingers.  We've got a look at Nestle's  deal to sell its chocolate business for nearly $3 billion.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down, the founder of Bold Carrie Sheffield is here, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be here.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  It's awesome to be here.  I'm so glad we got  to report on Bank of America because we're going to see what happens out of  Goldman Sachs.  It's actually expected that -- their revenues and net  earnings are going to be down 5 percent.  And they had problems in an area  they dominated which is fixed income currencies and commodities.</p><p> So their fixed income department has had a hard time last year.  Let's see  what happens to this.  I mean it's the diverging results coming from the  banks especially, you know, titans like Goldman Sachs -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Goldman has had a hard time -- </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- in being dominant period. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, it's pretty interesting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll follow that.  It was the case at one point as the  banks go, so goes the rest of the market.  But this whole market has been  so broad-based in terms of the rallies.  So we'll see what happens with the  banks this morning.  Longer term they certainly looking optimistic.  </p><p> Coming up this morning former CKE Restaurant CEO Andy Puzder is with us;  former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will join us; Fox News  senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; family medicine  physician Dr. Mike is here; and the CEO of Cadre Ryan Williams will join us  as well.</p><p> Big unicorn there.  You don't want to miss a moment of it.  </p><p> But first this, Republicans are on a deadlock on the government spending  fix as Congress barrels toward the Friday budget deadline.</p><p> The impasse comes after House leaders proposed a new short-term strategy  that would fund the government through February 16 while allowing more time  for negotiations on DACA.</p><p> But conservative Republicans are pushing for a deal that includes more  funding for the Pentagon and revealed last night that the GOP leadership  does not have the votes to pass a government funding bill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  Democrats are making an untenable demand  where they're putting illegal aliens above the interest of national  security.</p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  There is not support for the  current leadership plan as proposed at this point.  There are two or three  options that are out there.  We're going to have to have discussions with  our leadership.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile a bipartisan group of lawmakers are set to unveil a  new DACA bill today.  I want to bring in White House director of  legislative affairs, Marc Short.</p><p> Marc -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  Maria -- thanks  for having me on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are we on this?  Can you give us a status check?  </p><p> SHORT:  On the spending bill and DACA -- that's how they are tied together.   It's what we have had this week, it's an expectation of Thursday, Friday  vote on another continuing resolution -- Maria, that would get us into  February to allow more time for DACA and its conversations.</p><p> We met at a staff level with the staff from Leader McCarthy, Leader Hoyer,  Leader Cornyn as well as Senator Durbin yesterday.  I think there will be a  principles' meeting today in which those members will be joined by General  Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen from DHS to continue conversations to move  forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will the Freedom Caucus go along with that?  Even though we  just heard Mark Meadows say look, we're not in favor of the leadership plan  here.</p><p> SHORT:  Maria -- we understand the frustration.  Keep in mind that we  submit a budget to Congress in February for 2018.  Mick Mulvaney, OMB  director is about to submit a budget in just a couple of weeks for 2019.   And yet we still haven't funded 2018 to date.</p><p> So we submit our budget in February.  Congress should have a bill completed  by September 30 at the end of the fiscal year.</p><p> Here we are now in mid-January still not having a funding bill for 2018  which is why we are continued to force to do these continuing resolutions  because nobody wants a shutdown.  That hurts federal workers and it hurts  our Defense Department, it hurts our military.  And we need to make sure  that we're continuing to fund our troops.</p><p> The Democrat position has been and continues to be we are going to shut  down the government, stop paying our troops unless there's a deal for  illegal aliens in place.  We are trying to get a deal to solve the DACA  problem but we don't want to shut down the government.</p><p> We think that we'll end up getting that passed this weak to buy us another  month but we're all frustrated -- Maria.  This is not the way Congress is  supposed to work.  They're supposed to have a funding bill completed by  September 30.  We're now in mid-January.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And you're absolutely right.  I mean you're basically  being held hostage and running the government every two weeks. </p><p> SHORT:  That's right.  It's not the way to run the government.  And the  biggest concern is frankly on the national security level.  Secretary  Mattis has continued to go and talk, not just to Republican leaders but  also the Democrat leaders and Schumer and Pelosi and say what you're doing  is tying my hands.  We cannot make the necessary planning that I need to  help make sure our country is secure and safe.  And you're putting our  troops' funding in jeopardy.  And it's a real national security risk for  us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how do you get that communicated to the American people?  I  mean we recognize the threats that are out there in terms of national  security for this country.</p><p> And we also recognize that the Democrats would like the government to shut  down because they believe that Republicans will be blamed.</p><p> SHORT:  There is a sense that if Republicans control the House, the Senate  and the White House they'll get blamed.  But the reality is that Democrats,  we need 60 votes in the United States senate.  The Democrats are the ones  that have a lot of power here and they are, as you say, holding American  people and the government hostage in order to get demands that they want on  DACA.</p><p> And when you talk about national security, Maria, something that was lost I  think in all the conversation, all the soap opera drama the last couple of  days, a report that came out that said three out of four terrorists  convicted here in the United States are foreign born.</p><p> But something else is as in that report that was missing.  Over 2,500  people every year on the terror watch list try to get into our country.   That is seven per day.</p><p> So here we are having all this drama and discussion about what he said, she  said.  And we're not focused on the reality that there are terrorists  trying to get into our country every day and we are trying to fix chain  migration and the lottery visa program to make sure our country is safe and  secure.</p><p> Seven everyday are apprehended or turned away from trying to come in.   Seven people on the FBI's terror watch list.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a pretty incredible number actually.  But you're also  facing a group where they would prefer the government to shut down because  they don't want the legislative agenda to get executed, isn't that right?</p><p> SHORT:  Well, I think we're going to find that out this week.  Those are  questions on whether or not they really want a government shutdown or they  just think that they can bluff to try to get people to cave to their  demands on DACA.</p><p> And so we're going to find out this week because I think in reality  Republicans will end up holding together in making sure that we're given  more time to continue negotiate and we avoid a shutdown.</p><p> But again, this is no way to run a government.  We continue to do this  every couple of weeks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SHORT:  The administration submitted a budget in February of 2017 and here  we are again in mid-January without funding for 2018, much less beginning  in 2019.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, let's talk about the broader agenda -- Marc.  This is the  -- an anniversary week for the President, the first year in office under  his belt.  What are the priorities for '18?</p><p> SHORT:  Well, Maria -- I think that we are going to take time to review  2017 because of it was historic in so many ways.  But 2018 also will  feature an infrastructure plan that the President will probably unveil  closer to the State of the Union.  As well as continue to move forward in  areas to rollback the regulatory state and look to require work  requirements in some of the Medicaid payments as you've seen that HHS has  already unveiled.</p><p> So those will continue to be priorities for the administration.  But we  want to secure the border.  We want to make sure our troops are funded.   And we want to get this government funded.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All the while, Democrats have been saying that they want  infrastructure.  Reports say that the President will actually present an  infrastructure plan during the State of the Union.  Do you have plans to  tout an infrastructure plan for the State of the Union?</p><p> SHORT:  There are plans for that.  The President has a plan in place; it's  a matter of timing.  We will continue to have conversations with Congress.   Our team at NEC has been doing that for the last few weeks and they'll  continue to over the next couple of weeks leading up to the State of the  Union to make sure they're fully briefed on what the plan will be.</p><p> But you should look for the President to unveil that closer to the State of  the Union.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It seems like, you know, on the left, the whole point in all of  the decisions is to win the 2018 -- win as many seats as they can in the  2018 elections.  I mean that's what they're going for and that's why the  obstruction is probably only going to pick up.</p><p> SHORT:  Well, I think you're right.  This is an election year and so there  will be a lot more obstruction and probably the expectations for what we  can do legislatively will diminish as the year goes along.</p><p> We have a lot of plans to begin the year.  But to your point, Democrats  will have to make a case as to why not -- not one of them voted for tax  relief that now 2.1 million Americans now -- 2.1 million workers have  either received a bonus or a pay increase since the tax release -- since  the tax package was passed just a couple of weeks ago.</p><p> There will continue to be more.  And they will have to explain why  unemployment in America is at its lowest point ever for African-Americans,  lowest point ever for Hispanic Americans -- a 17-year-low, and yet they are  stopping the economic plans of this administration.</p><p> So we look forward to that debate coming forth throughout the rest of year. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what is the biggest pushback from the left?  Is it funding  the border wall?  Giving the President the money that he is asking for?  Or  is it funding the military?</p><p> SHORT:  That's a great question -- Maria.  I think the reality is that on  the border security, keep in mind in 2006 most Democrats voted for the  Secure Fence Act that would have funded the wall including Chuck Schumer.</p><p> In 2013, over $40 billion was in the Democrat plan on part of their Dream  Act to provide border security.  So they have been willing to vote for it  before.  The only difference now is that Donald Trump is president.</p><p> So in my mind, it's less of a policy issue and purely a political issue  where there is a recognition of the security needs but for political  reasons looking to hold back support.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much of the conversation around the President's personality  and his remarks -- is that getting in the way in terms of doing a deal?  Or  is that just noise coming from the left.</p><p> SHORT:  Yes.  I think it's a lot of noise, frankly Maria.  I think that the  conversations yesterday were cordial.  I think that we'll have, hopefully  continued progress but keep in mind the administration put forward our  principles and what we want on this plan back in October.</p><p> Again we're in mid-January.  We refined that plan a couple of weeks ago and  took some things off the table to try to get closer to negotiations.  So  we've been leaning forward into this.</p><p> We're anxious for Congress to come back and say, ok these are reasonable  things you're asking for -- end of the visa lottery program which as you  know, was a program in which the pipe bomber came in.  End the chain  migration which as you know, is the program through which the terrorist who  ran over people in New York came through.</p><p> And begin to secure the border.  Those are practical requests for the  American people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean are you getting at least an acknowledgement that the  visa program is ridiculous?</p><p> SHORT:  I think that -- I think there's a growing consensus that the visa  program is ridiculous, as you say.  I think the question is the Democrat  position has been, let's take those visas and reallocate them to other  programs like the temporary protected status program.  Or they think the  administration just believes that program should be terminated.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Marc -- thanks so much for walking us through it all.  Great  insights from you.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p> SHORT:  Thanks -- Maria.  Thanks for having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will be watching the developments.  Marc Short at the White  House. </p><p> Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health -- reporters  poke and prod at President Trump's glowing physical exam report yesterday.   The bizarre questions that embarrassed the entire media for the White House  doctor -- coming up.</p><p> And then a bittersweet parting -- Nestle offloading its candy business to  an Italian chocolate giant for nearly $3 billion; why the deal could signal  a new future for Nestle.</p><p> Stay with us</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   I'm Cheryl Casone with your headlines. </p><p> Two Navy commanders facing negligent homicide charges related to the deadly  crash of two different ships last year.  They are former Commander Bryce  Benson of the USS Fitzgerald and former Commander Alfredo Sanchez of the  USS John McCain.</p><p> The Fitzgerald collided with a commercial ship near Japan in June.  That  killed seven sailors.  Ten were killed in August when the John s. McCain  crashed into an oil tanker.  This happened in Southeast Asia.</p><p> The story we're following for you this morning.  McDonald's is pledging to  have fully recyclable packaging by 2025.  The fast food chain also said  that recycling bins are going to be put in all of its restaurants.  Today  about half of McDonald's packaging comes from renewable, recyclable,  certified material.</p><p> Taking a look at the stocks -- shares of McDonald's restaurant up nearly 40  percent over the last year.</p><p> And then listen to this.  Nestle is selling its U.S. candy business to  Italy's Ferrero for about $2.8 billion in cash.  The brands being sold  include Butterfinger, Crunch and Runts -- all the good stuff, right.</p><p> The deal is going to make the Ferrero the third largest candy maker in the  United States.  Some analysts say that the move by Nestle is going to help  it focus more on healthier products.  They've actually been trying to do  that -- Maria.  </p><p> Shares of Nestle, up about 15 percent from a year ago.</p><p> All right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All the good stuff.</p><p> CASONE:  It's all the good stuff, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Like nothing better happen to my Butterfingers.  (INAUDIBLE) the  Butterfinger ice creams that are made of.  There is a healthy ecosystem off  of all those delicious candy.</p><p> M1:  You want the healthy Butterfinger.  That's why -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nobody.</p><p> M1:  Nobody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DR. RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  There's no indication whatsoever  that he has any cognitive issues.  You know, he's very sharp and you know,  he's very articulate when he speaks to me.  I found no reason whatsoever to  think that the President has any issues whatsoever with his thought  process.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The media embarrassed itself yesterday.  Reporters poking and  prodding at President Trump's glowing physical exam report.  The bizarre  questions to the White House doctor -- next.</p><p> Then a Netflix for luxury cars -- BMW and Mercedes Benz, both reportedly  rolling out subscription services for a hassle-free ride.  We'll take you  under the hood of the new plan.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Wow, what a flu season.  The deadly flu season could get even worse.  The  severity of the virus is overwhelming emergency rooms across the country.   At least 20 children have died as a result.</p><p> Hospitals in California have begun turning their parking lots into  makeshift treatment centers to deal with the massive overcrowding caused by  flu patients.</p><p> Joining us right now is family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, better  known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike -- good to see you.</p><p> DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And I told you during the  break I'm just back because I had a really bad cold.  It's not the flu but  I was afraid because the flu is seriously dangerous this season.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Very, very dangerous.  The flu is dangerous all seasons  actually.  We always forget when a year goes by that the last flu season  wasn't so bad. </p><p> But the flu does kill.  It's a deadly virus.  Even those who get it and  don't die from it they are out of work for a week, two weeks because of  high fevers, body aches, severe fatigue.</p><p> It's not a virus that's just like the common cold that goes away after a  few days.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can you do about it?  Do you just do Tamiflu?  What do you  do about it?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Well, Tamiflu is a great anti-viral and it's best taken within  the first 48 hours of having the symptoms.  That's why I always recommend a  senior doctor right away when the symptoms do start.</p><p> Although there has been some promise with taking Tamiflu after the 48  hours.  That can reduce the complication rate with does kill people in very  severe populations that are susceptible -- thinking over the age of 65,  under the age of five.</p><p> KELLY:  So I guess the main question is should people be getting flu shots?   Did the flu shot actually work this season?  Because we are guessing at  what strains and cultures it actually is going to be here -- I like that.   So is the flu shot even worth it this year?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  So the flu shot is definitely worth it.  There has been a lot  of excitement because initially, the way we decide if the flu shots can be  effective in prediction, we look at Australia.  Because they're in the  southern hemisphere, they experience their flu season before ours.</p><p> Their flu shot was only about 10 percent effective for the current strain  that we have.  The current strain is an H3N2 strain.  It means absolutely  nothing to the regular person but to scientists we get excited about it.</p><p> And what we found is the current flu shot is about 30 percent effective; 30  percent effective -- still very much worth getting.  And even if it doesn't  prevent you from getting the flu, it will tone down your symptoms, it will  shorten the course.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  And what we've seen is over time, if you consistently yearly  get flu shots it works even more effectively.</p><p> CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD:  Does the weather have any impact because  for me, you know, the snowstorm has been crazy.  I got cold.  I felt like  that affected my immune system.</p><p> Are you saying that like the weather pattern is affecting it?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's so cold this season.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  There is a couple of things that come from that.  When  it's cold, generated humidity -- the humidity is lower so germs hang around  longer in the air.  So someone can sneeze in a conference room, an hour  later you walk in those germs are still hanging around.</p><p> Also because it's cold everyone is staying inside.  We are closer together.   So if one person gets sick it spreads that much quicker.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Constantly washing your hands is really important.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Washing your hands and not touching your face.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the President's health.  The White House  doctor said that commander in chief is in good health but that was not  enough for the mainstream media.</p><p> Watch this charade.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Does the President wear dentures.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you looking at things like early onset  Alzheimer's?  Are you looking at dementia like some -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy  reasons.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  His weight I think is at 239, right.  That -- it  seems it's just shy of obesity.</p><p> JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're confident of that number and -- </p><p> JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- and did you do any measurements.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Recently where the President appeared to slur his  words while giving an address.  Did you look into what the cause of that  might have been at all?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I could not believe this yesterday.  I tweeted out in the  middle of it, \"No words.\"  No words.  I was embarrassed for my industry.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  All of the things going on -- all the things going on in the  country, that's what they're dealing with.  And he weighs 239; I hadn't  weighed that since I was 17.  I should be dead by now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They were upset that the President -- there wasn't anything bad  to report.  I mean they were -- </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  He's never -- he doesn't drink.  He doesn't smoke.  He doesn't  do drugs.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the doctor said a lifetime of no alcohol and no tobacco  really has served him incredibly well.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Well, they're talking about the 25th amendment because they're  obsessed.  They think that the President is not going to make it through  his first term and he's not going to run for reelection.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, not only do they think but they're definitely creating  that narrative.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Oh yes.  I call it the 50 states of impeachment fantasy where  they just have all these scenarios that they think that he just won't make  it.  And he's going to be impeached because of his health.</p><p> So that's why they're doing this.  It's just -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- as a medical doctor.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me.  I see a lot of people critiquing  someone's health before they know exactly what's going on, especially from  the mental health side.  In order to know anything about someone's mental  health, you need to sit down with them.  You need to have a conversation  with them.  You need to talk about their family history.</p><p> So to see some journalists and even doctors come on and say I know that  this person has x illness.  That is medically unethical.  You are doing a  disservice to yourself.  You're doing a disservice to your patients because  you're proving that you don't follow the medical process.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Is it hard to measure mental health if you don't have a  baseline?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  It's hard to measure mental health when you haven't  interviewed and sat down with the person.  It's impossible.  You can't do  it.  You have to spend time.  They have to be your patient otherwise you're  just making stuff up.</p><p> KELLY:  There's nothing wrong with dentures, by the way, people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  George Washington, right.</p><p> But I mean have you ever seen anything like that? I mean President Obama  was a huge smoker.  There was no comments about it.  No one said anything.</p><p> I mean President Bush also had issues.  Have you ever seen anything like  that yesterday?  It was extraordinary.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, it was pretty bad.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Look at how many heavy drinkers we had.  Look at all the -- I  know the President said the (INAUDIBLE) was on.  We've had -- President  Trump might be one of the more saner presidents we've had.  Look at -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- trying to propagate because he's drunk.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  It's just very -- it's this very narrative.  Ever since, you  know, he won they have this agenda where they want to obstruct in every way  possible.  So that's -- this is just par for the course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good for you -- Mr. President.  Congratulations on excellent  health.  </p><p> Dr. Mike -- good to see you, sir.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> Coming up, the DACA dispute -- the Department of Justice go straight to the  Supreme Court over a ruling to block President Trump from ending the Obama- era program that protects illegal immigrants who entered the country as  children.</p><p> The very latest in the legal battle on DACA coming up.</p><p> And then is it time for tech titans trust buster.  We'll take a look at  whether the industry's biggest names have gotten too big.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 17th; your top stories right  now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Border battle, Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen pushing the  administration's position on Immigration including sanctuary cities.  She  warned that leaders in those cities could face prosecution.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The  Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. </p><p> The context of this is of course not only putting my ICE officers at risk  but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our Immigration  laws.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> A closer look at the Immigration fight on Capitol Hill as Democrats  including Cory Booker put on a show yesterday to try to slam the president;  the outrage coming up.</p><p> Earnings season in focus on Wall Street.  Goldman Sachs set to report  momentarily after Bank of America reported mixed results, we'll have those  numbers for you as soon as they hit the tape; Goldman shares are up ahead  of the numbers.</p><p> Markets this morning rallying, take a look at Futures indicating a big move  at the start of trading this morning up 140 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial Average, that's one half of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up 23,  that's a third of a percent higher as is the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> After a wild session yesterday on Wall Street, the Dow hitting 26,000,  seven days after a 25,000 but then by the close it erased all the gains as  the session wore on and went negative.</p><p> Overseas action this morning in Europe, looks weak.  As you see the FT 100  down a quarter of a percent.  The CAC krone and the DAX Index also weaker.   I should point out this is well off of the lows of the morning so we're  seeing a bit of a comeback in Europe right now.</p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed as you see there.</p><p> A new law could prevent your ability to travel overseas, how you could lose  your passport over late taxes.</p><p> And cracking down on big Tech, a look at the possible antitrust push on  companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, something we've been expecting  here on this program.</p><p> Luxury for less, BMW and Mercedes Benz, the latest automakers to test a  subscription service.</p><p> Plus, Senator Orrin Hatch puts on a spectacle, how his invisible glasses  went viral.</p><p> All that coming up this morning.</p><p> But first our top story this half an hour, the legal dispute over DACA.   The Department of Justice asking for the Supreme Court to immediately  review a federal judge's ruling that blocked President Trump from ending  the program.  Last week a district judge ordered the administration to  continue protecting immigrants who entered the country illegally as  children.</p><p> In a statement yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Session said this, \"It  defies both law and common sense for DACA --  to somehow be mandated  nationwide by a single District Court in San Francisco.\"</p><p> Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.</p><p> And Judge we keep asking the same question -- </p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- why is the Ninth Court is so influential in the whole  country?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  The Ninth Circuit, because the president's opponents filed  their complaints in California since they know that an overwhelming  majority of federal judges there are likely to resist the president.</p><p> So, there's a couple of questions here, one, was a federal judge in  California authorized to restrain the president nationwide?</p><p> The answer, \"Yes.\"</p><p> Now that is a rarely exercised a power, usually you restrain the president  or you restrain the defendant just in the area where you sit but when the  defendant or his agents are present nationwide and you believe the  defendant is engaging in unconstitutional behavior, which is what this  judge found -- I don't agree with him but did he have the authority to  enjoin the president?</p><p> He did.</p><p> Then the president said, \"We have to make these laws based on love and I'm  going to let DACA stay in place.\"</p><p> Then the president's lawyers advised him, 'if you don't appeal this, you  are sending the wrong signal to the court that maybe you really are  ambivalent about exercising these powers.'</p><p> So, they filed the appeal yesterday.  They bypassed your - at least  favorite circuit court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and went  directly to the Supreme Court; that is very rare and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- 99 percent of the time you do that the Supreme Court says,  \"Go to the Circuit Court first,\" but on every, single, without fail,  Immigration case that has started at California Federal District Court and  gone to the Ninth Circuit, and gone to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court  has reversed the Ninth Circuit.</p><p> So, the Justice Department is saying, we want to go to you directly because  we need an answer right away -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- I can't predict what the Supreme Court is going to do.</p><p> KELLY:  Well when is the Supreme Court going to hear this and decide on  this (ph)?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Entirely up to them -- </p><p> KELLY:  OK.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Kevin.</p><p> If it had gone to the Ninth Circuit they have a short window in which to  rule but because it goes to the Supremes, they can sit in it for as long as  they want.</p><p> In the meantime, the federal district judge's order stays in place and if  you are in this category of 800,000 -- of pretty much Americanized people  but born in another country and came here as babies, you can apply for the  DACA protection.</p><p> Now that DACA protection is for a year.  If you apply and get it then it's  another year before the president can invalidate it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- to get to a couple of different issues because we also want  to talk about 'sanctuary cities' with the Judge but first this, an  Oversight Hearing on Border Security took a real turn yesterday and we want  to get your take.</p><p> Senators began grilling DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over her role in  last week's White House Immigration meeting.</p><p>New Jersey Democrat, Cory Booker hit her especially hard, yelling at her  after she said she did not recall President Trump's vulgar language  reportedly used during the meeting.</p><p> Watch this?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. COREY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY:  Your silence and your amnesia is  complicity.  I don't know is 73 percent of your time is spent concerned  about the people in fear in communities in this country.</p><p> I hurt.</p><p> When Dick Durbin called me, I had tears of rage when I heard about this  experience in that meeting and for you not to feel that hurt, and that  pain, and to dismiss some of the questions of my colleagues, saying, \"I've  already answered that line of questions,\" when tens of millions of  Americans are hurting right now because of what they're worried about what  happened in the White House.</p><p> That's unacceptable to me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Goldman Sachs numbers are out, we're going to get them in a  minute; they are better than expected.</p><p> Judge, who did he think he was talking to?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  He was (ph) -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Talking to the secretary of Homeland Security?  Putting on a  show like that, that was outrageous.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- he was talking to his political base in New Jersey and I  think it probably resonated with them.</p><p> I've known Senator -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Booker -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- outrageous.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- for many, many, years and this is the way he is.</p><p> It was over the top.  It was loud.  It was disrespectful but this is what  happens occasionally when cabinet members clash with a member of Congress  in the - in the opposite party.</p><p> I'm not surprised to see it, that's the way he operates.  He assures  himself of reelection with his base in -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- New Jersey -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in an era where you have men behaving badly and all of this  harassment going on, to speak to a professional woman, and she's sitting  there and he's yelling at her, like she did something was - it just  terrible.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You know, she burst the bubble with just one or two words,  which might have followed his ranting and raving, something like you know,  \"I'm trying to answer your questions.  I didn't come here for that,\" which  is pretty bold of a person to say to a senator.</p><p> Under the law she does have to answer to that Committee.</p><p> She doesn't have to tolerate that behavior -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She didn't have to tolerate -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO: Was he harassing her?</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Oh, absolutely.  He was aggressive.</p><p> KELLY:  I think he was.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  He was verbally abusive.</p><p> I mean this guy - I would love to see - we just had - you just had Marc  Short talking about how so many terrorist threats and people are coming in  on these immigration programs, where is this level of passionand just  defense of the American citizen, coming from Cory Booker?</p><p> I didn't see any -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where's - where's -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- of that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- the passion about Kate Steinle's death -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- where -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Senator -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- how about that?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Senator Booker was not in the room when the president said  whatever he said or didn't say whatever some people said he said but she  was.</p><p> Now I wasn't there, I don't know what he said and Senator -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That doesn't justify -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Booker -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- that kind of hostility, toward her (ph).</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Have you seen --  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- I agree - agree with you but I feel differently about this  because I know him so well, he's such a likable person and he's doing this  for political reasons, not for any male-female -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what's -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- animosity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Kirstjen Nielsen supposed to say?</p><p> \"Oh, OK, so then I'll just be your punching bag for an hour.\"</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Unfortunately, that's a part of the job.</p><p> I couldn't take it myself -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't think should -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- but it is part of the job -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- be part of the job.  </p><p> I don't think that's part of the job.  I'm outraged -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- remember (ph) -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- by it.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- we have done it (ph), Republicans have done it to Democrats  -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  You keep -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- as well.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- talking about emotion, he's like (INAUDIBLE) overage and all  this like, OK look, the whole point of being a senator is that you look at  facts objectively, you make hard policy choices, you don't cry, you're not  a cry-baby.</p><p> Again, if this was happening where a Republican male was yelling at a  Democratic, Liberal, female, they're -- the double standard would be just  deafening (ph) -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  But you have a very good point about the double standard but  no senator is perfect and they all sometimes play to the base at home.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- That's the only reason -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- he did it because the cameras -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- were rolling.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- Well look, he gets his 15 seconds of additional fame, he  gets us talking about it and then this resonates for him.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  But isn't that a distraction from the -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD: I don't -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- real -- what the real -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- think it resonates.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- is for the real question he wanted to ask; he already asked a  question -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Women everywhere should be -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- upset by that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- I don't know what the real question was, whether it was,  'the president used this phrase,' that 'the president now says he didn't  use,' or some senator say 'say he did,' and some senator say, 'he didn't,'  that's what's he was trying to get her to -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  No.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- acknowledge.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  I'm with you Maria.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  He's basically -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  I -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- saying, 'how could you forget what happened two days ago?'  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He is -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in no role to yell at her.</p><p> If she doesn't -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- This happens to all -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- recall, she doesn't recall.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- It happens -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He is not any bigger -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  -- It happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- than she is, she is - to belittle her like that.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It happens all the time.  I mean look at - look at the way  Eric Holder was treated by the Republicans in this very same Committee,  just as aggressively.</p><p> LAYFIELD: But to be Machiavellian, it didn't work.  You know, it does -- </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It works depending on what your goal is.</p><p> If your goal is to resonate the base at home, it works.</p><p> If your goal is to get her to change her mind, it doesn't work.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Well it's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well it happens -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- all the time, have you heard of 'hashtag times up'?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Andrew Napolitano?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Am I coming back?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They love you.</p><p> Thank you so much.</p><p> Judge Napolitano.</p><p> Let's go to (ph) Goldman Sachs for second (ph), reporting fourth-quarter  earnings, big number here both on profit and revenue.</p><p> Kevin Kelly, your thoughts?</p><p> KELLY:  My thought is they did actually exceptionally well in the  Investment Banking revenue side, they beat on that but one of the biggest  disappointments they had, once again is in their Fixed Income Currency and  Commodity side where it was a huge disappointment, they only generated 1  billion in revenues versus an estimate of 1.28.</p><p> On the Equity Sales and Trading side, same thing they were - (they earned)  1.37 billion versus 1.51.  They are losing their dominance in their  divisions that made them famous, that made them a corporate entity that was  so feared on Wall Street -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that why the stock is down?</p><p> KELLY:  -- Yes.</p><p> I think that is why the stock's down because they still haven't addressed  it and their CFO has repeatedly said, \"We're going to fix the problems in  the FICC division as well as Equities, and it hasn't happened but they have  done so well on the Investment Banking side.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But everybody's FICC division is under pressure, isn't that  right?</p><p> I mean -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Trading earnings (ph) -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Trading has been like that (ph).</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- being a slug, it's like you said -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- earlier, fourth-quarter earnings really don't matter.  It's - - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No volatility.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- it's what happens going forward.</p><p> This new tax package is going to accredit (ph) earnings about 20 percent.   It certainly looks like lack of regulation or regulation, breaking down  Dodd-Frank, is going to help banks a way, it's matters what's going  forward.</p><p> This fourth-quarter has not been a good quarter for banks, for last year it  has not necessarily been a good quarter for banks.  Next year looks to be.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  I'm with you there although I'm an interested party as a,  former Goldman alumni myself so matter what I say it's going to be through  that lens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, stock is down but the numbers look good but you're  right -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Trading is the - is a weak spot.</p><p> Will take a break.</p><p> When we come back the tax man cometh for your passport, how your tax debt  could potentially put your passport at risk of being revoked.</p><p> Then they are all the rage, Senator Orrin Hatch sporting the latest trend  in eyewear, invisible glasses, the Utah Republican's hilarious Twitter  response after he was caught on camera taking off the glasses he wasn't  actually wearing.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> The IRS cracking down and seriously delinquent taxpayers.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, that's right Maria.</p><p> Taxpayers who owe the government a lot of money, they want to contact the  IRS about setting up some kind of plan under a new law that takes effect  later this month, the State Department could deny or revoke a passport for  anybody that's got unpaid taxes of more than $51,000.</p><p> Officials will probably only take that step if a taxpayer is subject to a  lien (ph) but still the threat is out there.</p><p> Well BMW and Mercedes-Benz planning to test subscription programs, one  monthly payment, will cover a car payment, maintenance, and insurance.   They are expected to announce their pilot programs in the US later this  year.</p><p> Remember a lot of other luxury brands, Audi, Cadillac, Porsche, they've  already launched similar subscription programs, kind of the new way to own  a car basically or not.</p><p> And then take a look at this, Senator Hatch causing a social media fire- storm, after he reached to take off his glasses that weren't really there.</p><p> The Utah senator look absolutely unfazed during the Senate Judiciary  Committee Hearing with Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p> Hatch's staffers had some fun.  Here's what they tweeted after the whole  thing went viral, \"Oh, you mean his invisible glasses from Warby Parker?   They're new, you've probably never heard of them.\"</p><p> I hope everybody gets the joke.</p><p> The 30-second video by the way racked up about 5 million views already so  it's all over YouTube and Facebook.  It's just funny Maria, like, 'Oh, my  glasses -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's cute.</p><p> CASONE:  -- that I'm not wearing.'</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> It's sort of like when you're like, 'where are my glasses, where are my  glasses?'  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO: They are on your head.</p><p> CASONE:  On your head, yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Are they are going to test (ph) Senator Hatch for his mental  stability now, that he's taking off fake glasses - - </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  Well you know -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's get -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- he's retiring.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- the doctor in.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have a press conference going.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- back in a -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  I've covered -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- press conference.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- since 2003, I'm from Utah so I used to cover him as a  college student and I love him but I think most of Utah agrees it was time  for him to go.</p><p> I mean he's just the longest-serving Republican senator, it's time for him  to go.</p><p> But what I'm worried about is this - and I love Romney but I just think the  civil war between the Trump versus you know, 'never Trump' people, it's -  this civil war has got to end and that's what I'm worried about with  Romney.</p><p> As much as I love Mitt Romney, some reporters are saying that Jon Huntsman  actually might get into the fray -- </p><p> KELLY:  The Republicans -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- to come out -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He was a 'never Trumper,' I mean there's no doubt about it,  Romney?</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- Right, we're -- </p><p> KELLY:  -- Republicans have everything, it's like '86 Bears (ph) right now,  'What can go wrong?  OK, well maybe Dick and Buddy Ryan gets into a fight.'</p><p> That's what goes wrong.</p><p> Republicans won everything and they are spending their time fighting with  each other, 'self-sabotage.'</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's a good point.</p><p> Coming up today's Technology titans, are they too powerful.  We're  unpacking the antitrust argument against Facebook, Google, and Amazon,  among others.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Dominating giant technology companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon,  raising the question, 'should they be broken up?'</p><p> Lauren Simonetti with the details and of course the questions -- </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- are 'broken-up' or are they needing more governance or what?</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You break them up, you regulate them, what do you do?</p><p> It's a fascinating question and the Wall Street Journal did an excellent  and a very deep-dive on this.</p><p> Basically, they compared the Tech giants of today to those of the last  century so first they looked at the share size, the influence of these  companies.</p><p> Just check it out 95 percent of young adults today use Facebook; 89 percent  use Google to search the Web; 75 percent use Amazon to buy e-books.</p><p> Let's compare that to back when, nine and 10 of us made phone calls using  AT&amp;T and got our fuel from Standard Oil.</p><p> So, many people want to know how these companies through the ages have  gotten so big and as far as that antitrust regulator argument, does the  size help or hurt you and me as the consumer.</p><p> So, let's take a look, back in the day, John D. Rockefeller and Standard  Oil.  He either bought other smaller refineries or drove them out of  business to become so large and in the process managed to keep oil prices,  kerosene mostly, low.</p><p> Standard Oil ruled in a legal monopoly back in 1911.</p><p> So, today as we've also seen, Facebook is buying competition: Instagram;  WhatsApp; Oculus VR.  Its services are mostly free for you and me and they  are constantly evolving themselves to make the product better.</p><p> So, it's hard to prove at least from that monopoly point of view that their  services are harmful to the - to the consumer.</p><p> You can look at the addictive nature of the products, that's another  argument altogether.</p><p> Let's look at Amazon, it bought Staples; it bought Whole Foods, not even a  competitor, still managing to keep prices low.</p><p> Alphabet probably coming under the heaviest scrutiny here, paying billions  and billions of dollars in fines to European and US regulators for the way  they populate their search results which can often hurt their rival, the  competition.</p><p> These companies nonetheless and we're going to pull up a chart, they have  made investors wealthy but 2018 is going to offer a new test especially as  we look at these creative tie-ups: vertical mergers, when you don't buy  direct; competitor and we'll see that in March as AT&amp;T continues to try to  you know, merge with Time Warner.</p><p> Is it possible?</p><p> What is the government going to say?</p><p> And how do you regulate companies that have invaded our lives?</p><p> KELLY:  Well the biggest issue that you're seeing is on Facebook  (INAUDIBLE), right (ph), they were basically a media company, there were -  you could pay them in rubles -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- to push a story to - about whatever candidate you wanted.</p><p> And guess what?</p><p> Fox isn't held to the - to the same - Fox has standards, right, you have to  decide where you're getting your -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- information from, how and you know -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- the publishers need to be vetted.</p><p> Facebook certainly didn't do that and they certainly undermined democracy  by doing this.</p><p> They didn't vet.  They took it everywhere, even the Germans took action  against Facebook because -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- there's one more thing - and there's one more thing and that  is the data that these companies have about us, they know everything.</p><p> Well I mean Google -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- they obviously know everything that we're searching for -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You looked -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- but -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  -- so that's sweater so let me show you this one, oh -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Right.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  -- this happens to be one of our sites that sells it (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, much data, that's why they're so powerful.</p><p> SHEFFIELD:  I think there's also the issue of bias so I work with an  organization called \"Lincoln Network\" in Silicon Valley which is  Libertarian conservatives in Silicon Valley and they have just looked at  surveys talking to conservatives and libertarians in Silicon Valley and the  level of bias that these employees feel in the Valley, they can't speak up.</p><p> And you also see conservative publications and conservative media outlets  getting censored or even you know, a Congresswoman tried to put up a pro- life ad on Twitter, it was - and it was shot down.</p><p> The same thing that you're seeing in Google and Facebook.</p><p> This is a big question as it relates to the First Amendment and Freedom of  Speech and also just the ability to express yourself ideologically.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  But it doesn't seem like it's a fair comparison to compare this  to Rockefeller, I mean Google laying those three underground cables across  the ocean at -- 10 times as -- 10 million times as fast as a modem, worries  you about them taking over the Internet but Rockefeller you had no option  with Standard Oil.</p><p> You had to buy oil from him, Carnegie, you had -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because he bought -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- to buy it still from him -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- everybody else.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- Because he bought everybody else and to this day and age,  (they've got) a kid in a garage somewhere in Silicon Valley could take down  Google theoretically -- </p><p> KELLY:  Not really -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  -- because they'll clamp-down -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- did not have -- </p><p> KELLY:  -- either you sell -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  -- or we'll - we'll wipe you out, you can't buy this.  That's what  happened -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- Yes.  That's -- </p><p> KELLY:  -- to Snapshot and Instagram.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- maybe that's - well that's what happened in MySpace.</p><p>MySpace offers the same thing and all of a sudden, they come along, \"Hey,  we all thought the same thing.\"</p><p> Look at that merger, I mean people would have thought the same thing,  Technology is increasing so rapidly -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  It is true -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- it is not like the -- </p><p> SHEFFIELD:  -- and there's also the barriers to entry are much lower than  Standard Oil will you have to have massive physical assets.</p><p> You can do so much in your basement with almost nothing.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  And we don't have -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- Teddy Roosevelt -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- to go after these guys like they had back then.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Lauren it's worth watching and I know the stocks will  also get impacted -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- if we do see a bigger government in Tech.</p><p> We'll take a break.</p><p> Thank you Lauren Simonetti.</p><p> Apocalypse now, one graphic artist imagines what it would look like if the  technology giants, Facebook and Google face the same fate as some  retailers.</p><p> Next hour, right here on Mornings with Maria; stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January 17th; your top stories right  now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Shut down showdown, lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to  keep the government funded.

Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, January 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shutdown looming -- lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to keep the government funded. One major hurdle: the battle over immigration reform. Republicans did little to close the gap last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The general consensus tonight was that there is not support for the current leadership plan as proposed. I think no one wants to shutdown. I think none of us, myself included, wants to shut down the government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The looming threat coming as stocks hit near record territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday cracked 26000 but it ended the day lower, below the milestone. After that the markets closed as you see fractionally lower. It was the second highest close in history however, even with the decline.</p><p>Futures this morning back in the green -- take a look. We are expecting a big open for the broader averages with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 145 points right now, one-half of 1 percent higher. Nasdaq is up 25 -- that's a third of a percent higher as earnings drive the day.</p><p>It is the season of fourth quarter numbers. Bank of America just hit the tape. Earnings of B of A are 47 cents a share, topped expectations. Revenue however was a slight miss. But the company said it took a nearly $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to write off assets due to the tax reform bill.</p><p>We are waiting for the numbers from Goldman Sachs. As you can see B of A and Goldman Sachs shares this morning are higher. As soon as the Goldman Sachs numbers hit the tape, we'll bring them to you.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a bit of a pull back. FT 100 down a quarter of a percent as is the DAX index. The CAC 40 it's just fractionally lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed with the Shanghai composite up a quarter of a percent and the Hang Seng also higher by a quarter of a percent in Hong Kong.</p><p>Flu season epidemic -- the vast number of cases overwhelming emergency rooms across the country. One hospital in California even forced to set up a makeshift treatment center in the parking lot to deal with the massive overcrowding caused by the flu.</p><p>One healthy place in the U.S., 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that's for sure. The White House doctor says that President Trump is in good health. But that wasn't enough for the mainstream media. The unbelievable questions and the outrage coming up from the press looking for any weaknesses and the doctor said the President is in excellent shape.</p><p>Plus could technology titans soon face anti-trust concerns? The surprising headwinds the likes of Facebook and Apple could be facing.</p><p>Plus this deal is anything but Butterfingers. We've got a look at Nestle's deal to sell its chocolate business for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down, the founder of Bold Carrie Sheffield is here, Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor John Layfield. Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: It's awesome to be here. I'm so glad we got to report on Bank of America because we're going to see what happens out of Goldman Sachs. It's actually expected that -- their revenues and net earnings are going to be down 5 percent. And they had problems in an area they dominated which is fixed income currencies and commodities.</p><p>So their fixed income department has had a hard time last year. Let's see what happens to this. I mean it's the diverging results coming from the banks especially, you know, titans like Goldman Sachs --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Goldman has had a hard time --</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- in being dominant period.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: Yes, it's pretty interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll follow that. It was the case at one point as the banks go, so goes the rest of the market. But this whole market has been so broad-based in terms of the rallies. So we'll see what happens with the banks this morning. Longer term they certainly looking optimistic.</p><p>Coming up this morning former CKE Restaurant CEO Andy Puzder is with us; former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will join us; Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; family medicine physician Dr. Mike is here; and the CEO of Cadre Ryan Williams will join us as well.</p><p>Big unicorn there. You don't want to miss a moment of it.</p><p>But first this, Republicans are on a deadlock on the government spending fix as Congress barrels toward the Friday budget deadline.</p><p>The impasse comes after House leaders proposed a new short-term strategy that would fund the government through February 16 while allowing more time for negotiations on DACA.</p><p>But conservative Republicans are pushing for a deal that includes more funding for the Pentagon and revealed last night that the GOP leadership does not have the votes to pass a government funding bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA: Democrats are making an untenable demand where they're putting illegal aliens above the interest of national security.</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: There is not support for the current leadership plan as proposed at this point. There are two or three options that are out there. We're going to have to have discussions with our leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile a bipartisan group of lawmakers are set to unveil a new DACA bill today. I want to bring in White House director of legislative affairs, Marc Short.</p><p>Marc -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS: Maria -- thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are we on this? Can you give us a status check?</p><p>SHORT: On the spending bill and DACA -- that's how they are tied together. It's what we have had this week, it's an expectation of Thursday, Friday vote on another continuing resolution -- Maria, that would get us into February to allow more time for DACA and its conversations.</p><p>We met at a staff level with the staff from Leader McCarthy, Leader Hoyer, Leader Cornyn as well as Senator Durbin yesterday. I think there will be a principles' meeting today in which those members will be joined by General Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen from DHS to continue conversations to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will the Freedom Caucus go along with that? Even though we just heard Mark Meadows say look, we're not in favor of the leadership plan here.</p><p>SHORT: Maria -- we understand the frustration. Keep in mind that we submit a budget to Congress in February for 2018. Mick Mulvaney, OMB director is about to submit a budget in just a couple of weeks for 2019. And yet we still haven't funded 2018 to date.</p><p>So we submit our budget in February. Congress should have a bill completed by September 30 at the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>Here we are now in mid-January still not having a funding bill for 2018 which is why we are continued to force to do these continuing resolutions because nobody wants a shutdown. That hurts federal workers and it hurts our Defense Department, it hurts our military. And we need to make sure that we're continuing to fund our troops.</p><p>The Democrat position has been and continues to be we are going to shut down the government, stop paying our troops unless there's a deal for illegal aliens in place. We are trying to get a deal to solve the DACA problem but we don't want to shut down the government.</p><p>We think that we'll end up getting that passed this weak to buy us another month but we're all frustrated -- Maria. This is not the way Congress is supposed to work. They're supposed to have a funding bill completed by September 30. We're now in mid-January.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And you're absolutely right. I mean you're basically being held hostage and running the government every two weeks.</p><p>SHORT: That's right. It's not the way to run the government. And the biggest concern is frankly on the national security level. Secretary Mattis has continued to go and talk, not just to Republican leaders but also the Democrat leaders and Schumer and Pelosi and say what you're doing is tying my hands. We cannot make the necessary planning that I need to help make sure our country is secure and safe. And you're putting our troops' funding in jeopardy. And it's a real national security risk for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how do you get that communicated to the American people? I mean we recognize the threats that are out there in terms of national security for this country.</p><p>And we also recognize that the Democrats would like the government to shut down because they believe that Republicans will be blamed.</p><p>SHORT: There is a sense that if Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House they'll get blamed. But the reality is that Democrats, we need 60 votes in the United States senate. The Democrats are the ones that have a lot of power here and they are, as you say, holding American people and the government hostage in order to get demands that they want on DACA.</p><p>And when you talk about national security, Maria, something that was lost I think in all the conversation, all the soap opera drama the last couple of days, a report that came out that said three out of four terrorists convicted here in the United States are foreign born.</p><p>But something else is as in that report that was missing. Over 2,500 people every year on the terror watch list try to get into our country. That is seven per day.</p><p>So here we are having all this drama and discussion about what he said, she said. And we're not focused on the reality that there are terrorists trying to get into our country every day and we are trying to fix chain migration and the lottery visa program to make sure our country is safe and secure.</p><p>Seven everyday are apprehended or turned away from trying to come in. Seven people on the FBI's terror watch list.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a pretty incredible number actually. But you're also facing a group where they would prefer the government to shut down because they don't want the legislative agenda to get executed, isn't that right?</p><p>SHORT: Well, I think we're going to find that out this week. Those are questions on whether or not they really want a government shutdown or they just think that they can bluff to try to get people to cave to their demands on DACA.</p><p>And so we're going to find out this week because I think in reality Republicans will end up holding together in making sure that we're given more time to continue negotiate and we avoid a shutdown.</p><p>But again, this is no way to run a government. We continue to do this every couple of weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SHORT: The administration submitted a budget in February of 2017 and here we are again in mid-January without funding for 2018, much less beginning in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, let's talk about the broader agenda -- Marc. This is the -- an anniversary week for the President, the first year in office under his belt. What are the priorities for '18?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Maria -- I think that we are going to take time to review 2017 because of it was historic in so many ways. But 2018 also will feature an infrastructure plan that the President will probably unveil closer to the State of the Union. As well as continue to move forward in areas to rollback the regulatory state and look to require work requirements in some of the Medicaid payments as you've seen that HHS has already unveiled.</p><p>So those will continue to be priorities for the administration. But we want to secure the border. We want to make sure our troops are funded. And we want to get this government funded.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the while, Democrats have been saying that they want infrastructure. Reports say that the President will actually present an infrastructure plan during the State of the Union. Do you have plans to tout an infrastructure plan for the State of the Union?</p><p>SHORT: There are plans for that. The President has a plan in place; it's a matter of timing. We will continue to have conversations with Congress. Our team at NEC has been doing that for the last few weeks and they'll continue to over the next couple of weeks leading up to the State of the Union to make sure they're fully briefed on what the plan will be.</p><p>But you should look for the President to unveil that closer to the State of the Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It seems like, you know, on the left, the whole point in all of the decisions is to win the 2018 -- win as many seats as they can in the 2018 elections. I mean that's what they're going for and that's why the obstruction is probably only going to pick up.</p><p>SHORT: Well, I think you're right. This is an election year and so there will be a lot more obstruction and probably the expectations for what we can do legislatively will diminish as the year goes along.</p><p>We have a lot of plans to begin the year. But to your point, Democrats will have to make a case as to why not -- not one of them voted for tax relief that now 2.1 million Americans now -- 2.1 million workers have either received a bonus or a pay increase since the tax release -- since the tax package was passed just a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>There will continue to be more. And they will have to explain why unemployment in America is at its lowest point ever for African-Americans, lowest point ever for Hispanic Americans -- a 17-year-low, and yet they are stopping the economic plans of this administration.</p><p>So we look forward to that debate coming forth throughout the rest of year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what is the biggest pushback from the left? Is it funding the border wall? Giving the President the money that he is asking for? Or is it funding the military?</p><p>SHORT: That's a great question -- Maria. I think the reality is that on the border security, keep in mind in 2006 most Democrats voted for the Secure Fence Act that would have funded the wall including Chuck Schumer.</p><p>In 2013, over $40 billion was in the Democrat plan on part of their Dream Act to provide border security. So they have been willing to vote for it before. The only difference now is that Donald Trump is president.</p><p>So in my mind, it's less of a policy issue and purely a political issue where there is a recognition of the security needs but for political reasons looking to hold back support.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much of the conversation around the President's personality and his remarks -- is that getting in the way in terms of doing a deal? Or is that just noise coming from the left.</p><p>SHORT: Yes. I think it's a lot of noise, frankly Maria. I think that the conversations yesterday were cordial. I think that we'll have, hopefully continued progress but keep in mind the administration put forward our principles and what we want on this plan back in October.</p><p>Again we're in mid-January. We refined that plan a couple of weeks ago and took some things off the table to try to get closer to negotiations. So we've been leaning forward into this.</p><p>We're anxious for Congress to come back and say, ok these are reasonable things you're asking for -- end of the visa lottery program which as you know, was a program in which the pipe bomber came in. End the chain migration which as you know, is the program through which the terrorist who ran over people in New York came through.</p><p>And begin to secure the border. Those are practical requests for the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean are you getting at least an acknowledgement that the visa program is ridiculous?</p><p>SHORT: I think that -- I think there's a growing consensus that the visa program is ridiculous, as you say. I think the question is the Democrat position has been, let's take those visas and reallocate them to other programs like the temporary protected status program. Or they think the administration just believes that program should be terminated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc -- thanks so much for walking us through it all. Great insights from you. Appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>SHORT: Thanks -- Maria. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will be watching the developments. Marc Short at the White House.</p><p>Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health -- reporters poke and prod at President Trump's glowing physical exam report yesterday. The bizarre questions that embarrassed the entire media for the White House doctor -- coming up.</p><p>And then a bittersweet parting -- Nestle offloading its candy business to an Italian chocolate giant for nearly $3 billion; why the deal could signal a new future for Nestle.</p><p>Stay with us</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with your headlines.</p><p>Two Navy commanders facing negligent homicide charges related to the deadly crash of two different ships last year. They are former Commander Bryce Benson of the USS Fitzgerald and former Commander Alfredo Sanchez of the USS John McCain.</p><p>The Fitzgerald collided with a commercial ship near Japan in June. That killed seven sailors. Ten were killed in August when the John s. McCain crashed into an oil tanker. This happened in Southeast Asia.</p><p>The story we're following for you this morning. McDonald's is pledging to have fully recyclable packaging by 2025. The fast food chain also said that recycling bins are going to be put in all of its restaurants. Today about half of McDonald's packaging comes from renewable, recyclable, certified material.</p><p>Taking a look at the stocks -- shares of McDonald's restaurant up nearly 40 percent over the last year.</p><p>And then listen to this. Nestle is selling its U.S. candy business to Italy's Ferrero for about $2.8 billion in cash. The brands being sold include Butterfinger, Crunch and Runts -- all the good stuff, right.</p><p>The deal is going to make the Ferrero the third largest candy maker in the United States. Some analysts say that the move by Nestle is going to help it focus more on healthier products. They've actually been trying to do that -- Maria.</p><p>Shares of Nestle, up about 15 percent from a year ago.</p><p>All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the good stuff.</p><p>CASONE: It's all the good stuff, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Like nothing better happen to my Butterfingers. (INAUDIBLE) the Butterfinger ice creams that are made of. There is a healthy ecosystem off of all those delicious candy.</p><p>M1: You want the healthy Butterfinger. That's why --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nobody.</p><p>M1: Nobody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN: There's no indication whatsoever that he has any cognitive issues. You know, he's very sharp and you know, he's very articulate when he speaks to me. I found no reason whatsoever to think that the President has any issues whatsoever with his thought process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The media embarrassed itself yesterday. Reporters poking and prodding at President Trump's glowing physical exam report. The bizarre questions to the White House doctor -- next.</p><p>Then a Netflix for luxury cars -- BMW and Mercedes Benz, both reportedly rolling out subscription services for a hassle-free ride. We'll take you under the hood of the new plan.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Wow, what a flu season. The deadly flu season could get even worse. The severity of the virus is overwhelming emergency rooms across the country. At least 20 children have died as a result.</p><p>Hospitals in California have begun turning their parking lots into makeshift treatment centers to deal with the massive overcrowding caused by flu patients.</p><p>Joining us right now is family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, better known as Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike -- good to see you.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And I told you during the break I'm just back because I had a really bad cold. It's not the flu but I was afraid because the flu is seriously dangerous this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Very, very dangerous. The flu is dangerous all seasons actually. We always forget when a year goes by that the last flu season wasn't so bad.</p><p>But the flu does kill. It's a deadly virus. Even those who get it and don't die from it they are out of work for a week, two weeks because of high fevers, body aches, severe fatigue.</p><p>It's not a virus that's just like the common cold that goes away after a few days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What can you do about it? Do you just do Tamiflu? What do you do about it?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Well, Tamiflu is a great anti-viral and it's best taken within the first 48 hours of having the symptoms. That's why I always recommend a senior doctor right away when the symptoms do start.</p><p>Although there has been some promise with taking Tamiflu after the 48 hours. That can reduce the complication rate with does kill people in very severe populations that are susceptible -- thinking over the age of 65, under the age of five.</p><p>KELLY: So I guess the main question is should people be getting flu shots? Did the flu shot actually work this season? Because we are guessing at what strains and cultures it actually is going to be here -- I like that. So is the flu shot even worth it this year?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: So the flu shot is definitely worth it. There has been a lot of excitement because initially, the way we decide if the flu shots can be effective in prediction, we look at Australia. Because they're in the southern hemisphere, they experience their flu season before ours.</p><p>Their flu shot was only about 10 percent effective for the current strain that we have. The current strain is an H3N2 strain. It means absolutely nothing to the regular person but to scientists we get excited about it.</p><p>And what we found is the current flu shot is about 30 percent effective; 30 percent effective -- still very much worth getting. And even if it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it will tone down your symptoms, it will shorten the course.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: And what we've seen is over time, if you consistently yearly get flu shots it works even more effectively.</p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD: Does the weather have any impact because for me, you know, the snowstorm has been crazy. I got cold. I felt like that affected my immune system.</p><p>Are you saying that like the weather pattern is affecting it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's so cold this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes. There is a couple of things that come from that. When it's cold, generated humidity -- the humidity is lower so germs hang around longer in the air. So someone can sneeze in a conference room, an hour later you walk in those germs are still hanging around.</p><p>Also because it's cold everyone is staying inside. We are closer together. So if one person gets sick it spreads that much quicker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Constantly washing your hands is really important.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Washing your hands and not touching your face.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about the President's health. The White House doctor said that commander in chief is in good health but that was not enough for the mainstream media.</p><p>Watch this charade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does the President wear dentures.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you looking at things like early onset Alzheimer's? Are you looking at dementia like some --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy reasons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His weight I think is at 239, right. That -- it seems it's just shy of obesity.</p><p>JACKSON: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're confident of that number and --</p><p>JACKSON: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- and did you do any measurements.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Recently where the President appeared to slur his words while giving an address. Did you look into what the cause of that might have been at all?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I could not believe this yesterday. I tweeted out in the middle of it, \"No words.\" No words. I was embarrassed for my industry.</p><p>LAYFIELD: All of the things going on -- all the things going on in the country, that's what they're dealing with. And he weighs 239; I hadn't weighed that since I was 17. I should be dead by now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They were upset that the President -- there wasn't anything bad to report. I mean they were --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: He's never -- he doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't do drugs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the doctor said a lifetime of no alcohol and no tobacco really has served him incredibly well.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Well, they're talking about the 25th amendment because they're obsessed. They think that the President is not going to make it through his first term and he's not going to run for reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, not only do they think but they're definitely creating that narrative.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Oh yes. I call it the 50 states of impeachment fantasy where they just have all these scenarios that they think that he just won't make it. And he's going to be impeached because of his health.</p><p>So that's why they're doing this. It's just --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as a medical doctor.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Here's what upsets me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Here's what upsets me. I see a lot of people critiquing someone's health before they know exactly what's going on, especially from the mental health side. In order to know anything about someone's mental health, you need to sit down with them. You need to have a conversation with them. You need to talk about their family history.</p><p>So to see some journalists and even doctors come on and say I know that this person has x illness. That is medically unethical. You are doing a disservice to yourself. You're doing a disservice to your patients because you're proving that you don't follow the medical process.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Is it hard to measure mental health if you don't have a baseline?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: It's hard to measure mental health when you haven't interviewed and sat down with the person. It's impossible. You can't do it. You have to spend time. They have to be your patient otherwise you're just making stuff up.</p><p>KELLY: There's nothing wrong with dentures, by the way, people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: George Washington, right.</p><p>But I mean have you ever seen anything like that? I mean President Obama was a huge smoker. There was no comments about it. No one said anything.</p><p>I mean President Bush also had issues. Have you ever seen anything like that yesterday? It was extraordinary.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, it was pretty bad.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Look at how many heavy drinkers we had. Look at all the -- I know the President said the (INAUDIBLE) was on. We've had -- President Trump might be one of the more saner presidents we've had. Look at --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- trying to propagate because he's drunk.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: It's just very -- it's this very narrative. Ever since, you know, he won they have this agenda where they want to obstruct in every way possible. So that's -- this is just par for the course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for you -- Mr. President.

The Department of Justice asking for the Supreme Court to immediately review a federal judge's ruling that blocked President Trump from ending the program. Last week a district judge ordered the administration to continue protecting immigrants who entered the country illegally as children.</p><p>In a statement yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Session said this, \"It defies both law and common sense for DACA -- to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single District Court in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge we keep asking the same question --</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- why is the Ninth Court is so influential in the whole country?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The Ninth Circuit, because the president's opponents filed their complaints in California since they know that an overwhelming majority of federal judges there are likely to resist the president.</p><p>So, there's a couple of questions here, one, was a federal judge in California authorized to restrain the president nationwide?</p><p>The answer, \"Yes.\"</p><p>Now that is a rarely exercised a power, usually you restrain the president or you restrain the defendant just in the area where you sit but when the defendant or his agents are present nationwide and you believe the defendant is engaging in unconstitutional behavior, which is what this judge found -- I don't agree with him but did he have the authority to enjoin the president?</p><p>He did.</p><p>Then the president said, \"We have to make these laws based on love and I'm going to let DACA stay in place.\"</p><p>Then the president's lawyers advised him, `if you don't appeal this, you are sending the wrong signal to the court that maybe you really are ambivalent about exercising these powers.'</p><p>So, they filed the appeal yesterday. They bypassed your - at least favorite circuit court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and went directly to the Supreme Court; that is very rare and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- 99 percent of the time you do that the Supreme Court says, \"Go to the Circuit Court first,\" but on every, single, without fail, Immigration case that has started at California Federal District Court and gone to the Ninth Circuit, and gone to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>So, the Justice Department is saying, we want to go to you directly because we need an answer right away --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- I can't predict what the Supreme Court is going to do.</p><p>KELLY: Well when is the Supreme Court going to hear this and decide on this (ph)?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Entirely up to them --</p><p>KELLY: OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Kevin.</p><p>If it had gone to the Ninth Circuit they have a short window in which to rule but because it goes to the Supremes, they can sit in it for as long as they want.</p><p>In the meantime, the federal district judge's order stays in place and if you are in this category of 800,000 -- of pretty much Americanized people but born in another country and came here as babies, you can apply for the DACA protection.</p><p>Now that DACA protection is for a year. If you apply and get it then it's another year before the president can invalidate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- to get to a couple of different issues because we also want to talk about `sanctuary cities' with the Judge but first this, an Oversight Hearing on Border Security took a real turn yesterday and we want to get your take.</p><p>Senators began grilling DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over her role in last week's White House Immigration meeting.</p><p>New Jersey Democrat, Cory Booker hit her especially hard, yelling at her after she said she did not recall President Trump's vulgar language reportedly used during the meeting.</p><p>Watch this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. COREY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY: Your silence and your amnesia is complicity.

Putting on a show like that, that was outrageous.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- he was talking to his political base in New Jersey and I think it probably resonated with them.</p><p>I've known Senator --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Booker --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- outrageous.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- for many, many, years and this is the way he is.</p><p>It was over the top. It was loud. It was disrespectful but this is what happens occasionally when cabinet members clash with a member of Congress in the - in the opposite party.</p><p>I'm not surprised to see it, that's the way he operates. He assures himself of reelection with his base in --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- New Jersey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in an era where you have men behaving badly and all of this harassment going on, to speak to a professional woman, and she's sitting there and he's yelling at her, like she did something was - it just terrible.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, she burst the bubble with just one or two words, which might have followed his ranting and raving, something like you know, \"I'm trying to answer your questions. I didn't come here for that,\" which is pretty bold of a person to say to a senator.</p><p>Under the law she does have to answer to that Committee.</p><p>She doesn't have to tolerate that behavior --</p><p>BARTIROMO: She didn't have to tolerate --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was he harassing her?</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Oh, absolutely. He was aggressive.</p><p>KELLY: I think he was.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: He was verbally abusive.</p><p>I mean this guy - I would love to see - we just had - you just had Marc Short talking about how so many terrorist threats and people are coming in on these immigration programs, where is this level of passionand just defense of the American citizen, coming from Cory Booker?</p><p>I didn't see any --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where's - where's --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- of that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the passion about Kate Steinle's death --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- where --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Senator --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- how about that?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Senator Booker was not in the room when the president said whatever he said or didn't say whatever some people said he said but she was.</p><p>Now I wasn't there, I don't know what he said and Senator --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That doesn't justify --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Booker --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- that kind of hostility, toward her (ph).</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Have you seen --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- I agree - agree with you but I feel differently about this because I know him so well, he's such a likable person and he's doing this for political reasons, not for any male-female --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- animosity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Kirstjen Nielsen supposed to say?</p><p>\"Oh, OK, so then I'll just be your punching bag for an hour.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Unfortunately, that's a part of the job.</p><p>I couldn't take it myself --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think should --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- but it is part of the job --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- be part of the job.</p><p>I don't think that's part of the job. I'm outraged --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- remember (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- by it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- we have done it (ph), Republicans have done it to Democrats --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: You keep --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- as well.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- talking about emotion, he's like (INAUDIBLE) overage and all this like, OK look, the whole point of being a senator is that you look at facts objectively, you make hard policy choices, you don't cry, you're not a cry-baby.</p><p>Again, if this was happening where a Republican male was yelling at a Democratic, Liberal, female, they're -- the double standard would be just deafening (ph) --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But you have a very good point about the double standard but no senator is perfect and they all sometimes play to the base at home.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- That's the only reason --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- he did it because the cameras --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- were rolling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Well look, he gets his 15 seconds of additional fame, he gets us talking about it and then this resonates for him.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But isn't that a distraction from the --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I don't --</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- real -- what the real --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- think it resonates.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- is for the real question he wanted to ask; he already asked a question --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Women everywhere should be --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- upset by that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- I don't know what the real question was, whether it was, `the president used this phrase,' that `the president now says he didn't use,' or some senator say `say he did,' and some senator say, `he didn't,' that's what's he was trying to get her to --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: No.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- acknowledge.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I'm with you Maria.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He's basically --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- saying, `how could you forget what happened two days ago?' --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in no role to yell at her.</p><p>If she doesn't --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- This happens to all --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- recall, she doesn't recall.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- It happens --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He is not any bigger --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- It happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- than she is, she is - to belittle her like that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It happens all the time. I mean look at - look at the way Eric Holder was treated by the Republicans in this very same Committee, just as aggressively.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But to be Machiavellian, it didn't work. You know, it does --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It works depending on what your goal is.</p><p>If your goal is to resonate the base at home, it works.</p><p>If your goal is to get her to change her mind, it doesn't work.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Well it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well it happens --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- all the time, have you heard of `hashtag times up'?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andrew Napolitano?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Am I coming back?</p><p>BARTIROMO: They love you.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>Judge Napolitano.</p><p>Let's go to (ph) Goldman Sachs for second (ph), reporting fourth-quarter earnings, big number here both on profit and revenue.</p><p>Kevin Kelly, your thoughts?</p><p>KELLY: My thought is they did actually exceptionally well in the Investment Banking revenue side, they beat on that but one of the biggest disappointments they had, once again is in their Fixed Income Currency and Commodity side where it was a huge disappointment, they only generated 1 billion in revenues versus an estimate of 1.28.</p><p>On the Equity Sales and Trading side, same thing they were - (they earned) 1.37 billion versus 1.51. They are losing their dominance in their divisions that made them famous, that made them a corporate entity that was so feared on Wall Street --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that why the stock is down?</p><p>KELLY: -- Yes.</p><p>I think that is why the stock's down because they still haven't addressed it and their CFO has repeatedly said, \"We're going to fix the problems in the FICC division as well as Equities, and it hasn't happened but they have done so well on the Investment Banking side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But everybody's FICC division is under pressure, isn't that right?</p><p>I mean --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Trading earnings (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Trading has been like that (ph).</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- being a slug, it's like you said --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- earlier, fourth-quarter earnings really don't matter. It's - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: No volatility.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- it's what happens going forward.</p><p>This new tax package is going to accredit (ph) earnings about 20 percent. It certainly looks like lack of regulation or regulation, breaking down Dodd-Frank, is going to help banks a way, it's matters what's going forward.</p><p>This fourth-quarter has not been a good quarter for banks, for last year it has not necessarily been a good quarter for banks. Next year looks to be.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I'm with you there although I'm an interested party as a, former Goldman alumni myself so matter what I say it's going to be through that lens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, stock is down but the numbers look good but you're right --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Trading is the - is a weak spot.</p><p>Will take a break.</p><p>When we come back the tax man cometh for your passport, how your tax debt could potentially put your passport at risk of being revoked.</p><p>Then they are all the rage, Senator Orrin Hatch sporting the latest trend in eyewear, invisible glasses, the Utah Republican's hilarious Twitter response after he was caught on camera taking off the glasses he wasn't actually wearing.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The IRS cracking down and seriously delinquent taxpayers.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that's right Maria.</p><p>Taxpayers who owe the government a lot of money, they want to contact the IRS about setting up some kind of plan under a new law that takes effect later this month, the State Department could deny or revoke a passport for anybody that's got unpaid taxes of more than $51,000.</p><p>Officials will probably only take that step if a taxpayer is subject to a lien (ph) but still the threat is out there.</p><p>Well BMW and Mercedes-Benz planning to test subscription programs, one monthly payment, will cover a car payment, maintenance, and insurance. They are expected to announce their pilot programs in the US later this year.</p><p>Remember a lot of other luxury brands, Audi, Cadillac, Porsche, they've already launched similar subscription programs, kind of the new way to own a car basically or not.</p><p>And then take a look at this, Senator Hatch causing a social media fire- storm, after he reached to take off his glasses that weren't really there.</p><p>The Utah senator look absolutely unfazed during the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing with Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p>Hatch's staffers had some fun. Here's what they tweeted after the whole thing went viral, \"Oh, you mean his invisible glasses from Warby Parker? They're new, you've probably never heard of them.\"</p><p>I hope everybody gets the joke.</p><p>The 30-second video by the way racked up about 5 million views already so it's all over YouTube and Facebook. It's just funny Maria, like, `Oh, my glasses --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's cute.</p><p>CASONE: -- that I'm not wearing.'</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>It's sort of like when you're like, `where are my glasses, where are my glasses?'</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They are on your head.</p><p>CASONE: On your head, yes.</p><p>KELLY: Are they are going to test (ph) Senator Hatch for his mental stability now, that he's taking off fake glasses - -</p><p>SHEFFIELD: Well you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's get --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- he's retiring.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the doctor in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have a press conference going.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- back in a --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I've covered --</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- press conference.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- since 2003, I'm from Utah so I used to cover him as a college student and I love him but I think most of Utah agrees it was time for him to go.</p><p>I mean he's just the longest-serving Republican senator, it's time for him to go.</p><p>But what I'm worried about is this - and I love Romney but I just think the civil war between the Trump versus you know, `never Trump' people, it's - this civil war has got to end and that's what I'm worried about with Romney.</p><p>As much as I love Mitt Romney, some reporters are saying that Jon Huntsman actually might get into the fray --</p><p>KELLY: The Republicans --</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- to come out --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He was a `never Trumper,' I mean there's no doubt about it, Romney?</p><p>SHEFFIELD: -- Right, we're --</p><p>KELLY: -- Republicans have everything, it's like `86 Bears (ph) right now, `What can go wrong? OK, well maybe Dick and Buddy Ryan gets into a fight.'</p><p>That's what goes wrong.</p><p>Republicans won everything and they are spending their time fighting with each other, `self-sabotage.'</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's a good point.</p><p>Coming up today's Technology titans, are they too powerful. We're unpacking the antitrust argument against Facebook, Google, and Amazon, among others.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Dominating giant technology companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, raising the question, `should they be broken up?'</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and of course the questions --</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- are `broken-up' or are they needing more governance or what?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. You break them up, you regulate them, what do you do?</p><p>It's a fascinating question and the Wall Street Journal did an excellent and a very deep-dive on this.</p><p>Basically, they compared the Tech giants of today to those of the last century so first they looked at the share size, the influence of these companies.</p><p>Just check it out 95 percent of young adults today use Facebook; 89 percent use Google to search the Web; 75 percent use Amazon to buy e-books.</p><p>Let's compare that to back when, nine and 10 of us made phone calls using AT&amp;T and got our fuel from Standard Oil.</p><p>So, many people want to know how these companies through the ages have gotten so big and as far as that antitrust regulator argument, does the size help or hurt you and me as the consumer.</p><p>So, let's take a look, back in the day, John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. He either bought other smaller refineries or drove them out of business to become so large and in the process managed to keep oil prices, kerosene mostly, low.</p><p>Standard Oil ruled in a legal monopoly back in 1911.</p><p>So, today as we've also seen, Facebook is buying competition: Instagram; WhatsApp; Oculus VR. Its services are mostly free for you and me and they are constantly evolving themselves to make the product better.</p><p>So, it's hard to prove at least from that monopoly point of view that their services are harmful to the - to the consumer.</p><p>You can look at the addictive nature of the products, that's another argument altogether.</p><p>Let's look at Amazon, it bought Staples; it bought Whole Foods, not even a competitor, still managing to keep prices low.</p><p>Alphabet probably coming under the heaviest scrutiny here, paying billions and billions of dollars in fines to European and US regulators for the way they populate their search results which can often hurt their rival, the competition.</p><p>These companies nonetheless and we're going to pull up a chart, they have made investors wealthy but 2018 is going to offer a new test especially as we look at these creative tie-ups: vertical mergers, when you don't buy direct; competitor and we'll see that in March as AT&amp;T continues to try to you know, merge with Time Warner.</p><p>Is it possible?</p><p>What is the government going to say?</p><p>And how do you regulate companies that have invaded our lives?</p><p>KELLY: Well the biggest issue that you're seeing is on Facebook (INAUDIBLE), right (ph), they were basically a media company, there were - you could pay them in rubles --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: -- to push a story to - about whatever candidate you wanted.</p><p>And guess what?</p><p>Fox isn't held to the - to the same - Fox has standards, right, you have to decide where you're getting your --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: -- information from, how and you know --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: -- the publishers need to be vetted.</p><p>Facebook certainly didn't do that and they certainly undermined democracy by doing this.</p><p>They didn't vet. They took it everywhere, even the Germans took action against Facebook because --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- there's one more thing - and there's one more thing and that is the data that these companies have about us, they know everything.</p><p>Well I mean Google --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- they obviously know everything that we're searching for --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. You looked --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- but --</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- so that's sweater so let me show you this one, oh --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- this happens to be one of our sites that sells it (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, much data, that's why they're so powerful.</p><p>SHEFFIELD: I think there's also the issue of bias so I work with an organization called \"Lincoln Network\" in Silicon Valley which is Libertarian conservatives in Silicon Valley and they have just looked at surveys talking to conservatives and libertarians in Silicon Valley and the level of bias that these employees feel in the Valley, they can't speak up.</p><p>And you also see conservative publications and conservative media outlets getting censored or even you know, a Congresswoman tried to put up a pro- life ad on Twitter, it was - and it was shot down.</p><p>The same thing that you're seeing in Google and Facebook.</p><p>This is a big question as it relates to the First Amendment and Freedom of Speech and also just the ability to express yourself ideologically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But it doesn't seem like it's a fair comparison to compare this to Rockefeller, I mean Google laying those three underground cables across the ocean at -- 10 times as -- 10 million times as fast as a modem, worries you about them taking over the Internet but Rockefeller you had no option with Standard Oil.</p><p>You had to buy oil from him, Carnegie, you had --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because he bought --</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- to buy it still from him --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- everybody else.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- Because he bought everybody else and to this day and age, (they've got) a kid in a garage somewhere in Silicon Valley could take down Google theoretically --</p><p>KELLY: Not really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: -- because they'll clamp-down --</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- did not have --</p><p>KELLY: -- either you sell --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: -- or we'll - we'll wipe you out, you can't buy this. That's what happened --</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- Yes.

The European Union has proposed a similar tax on digital services, and intergovernmental groups The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Group of Twenty (G20) have been working to develop an international consensus on tax reform.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the U.S., tech giants have been enjoying a favorable tax environment owing to the  , which lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% in addition to luring corporations to repatriate billions in overseas cash at a lower tax rate, dubbed a \"toll charge\", of 15.5%. Corporations like Apple, which had an estimated  prior to the tax bill, are taking the bargain: The tech giant said it would would repatriate much of the funds, and settle up a bill equivalent to a whopping $38 billion under the repatriation deal. </p><p>But there's a detail in the deal that could trip up investors over time, Moody's cautioned in a recent report studying the effects of the tax cuts on corporations. The bill can be paid over a period of eight years, on an adjusted schedule that shifts 45% of the liability to the last two years. Although companies have the option of paying it in a lump sum, \"substantially all\" corporations studied in the report -- including Apple, which has the largest tax liability by a wide margin -- opted for the 8-year repayment plan because there's no interest associated with the liability, said Moody's David Gonzales. And he warned that could translate into a drag on future cash flows.</p><p>\"Disclosures that we have reviewed to date indicate that tax liabilities relating to unrepatriated overseas earnings can be a significant drain on reported operating cash flows in future years,\" he said. \"Investors should scrutinize income tax disclosures because the notes to financial statements may not contain all of the pieces to a company's income tax puzzle.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Tunaru suggested that the tax changes in the U.S., over time, could have other unforeseen consequences for investors: Namely, by strengthening other countries' resolve to impose their own taxes on these companies. And that's in addition to other regulatory efforts, such as GDPR, that  <br/></p><p>\"Because of President Trump's international commercial protective nationalistic battle, all other large economies are insisting that the tech giants will pay their fair share of tax,\" Tunaru added. \"Hence, technology company stockholders are looking at a reduction in future revenues plus possible large fines for the past behavior of these companies.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">  member club</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

David Sowerby's  idea of a large cap is some mid cap, you and I don't know, this is way  cool.  Howard Ward of GAMCO, and with us joining, from the competitor of  Loomis Sayles, David Sowerby.  The two of you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOWERBY:  There's enough money for --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Do you wish you could be Howard Ward?  Do you wish it would  just be easy and go after the big visible names like Howard does?</p><p>SOWERBY:  No, I'd rather find names where there's five or fewer Wall  Street analyst who follow it than the 50 plus who follow Apple.  Ideally  how much value add can I do in analysis of Apple, not that you can't you  certainly can, but I'd rather find names where they're under followed and  where they spun out of a larger company and people don't want to own them  but there's value there.</p><p>KEENE:  How do you go with the steer, I mean I know you said you got a  portfolio mandate to do larger companies and all that --</p><p>SOWERBY:  Yes.</p><p>KEENE:  But, you got to love the idea of an information gap that you  can take advantage of, as Mr. Sowerby does.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  How do you avoid a value trap, Howard's career is a legacy of  value traps he tries to avoid.  How do you avoid a mid cap, small cap value  trap?</p><p>SOWERBY:  I want to avoid a mid cap stock that looks value like that's  on its way to small cap.  And is the company very shareholder focused?  Are  they generating return on invested capital, great free cash flow?  That  really sums it up, are they good on capital discipline, and if that's the  case, an evaluation is compelling and the free cash flow is going to  improve, then you have a value opportunity and not a value trap.</p><p>JOHNSON:  David, we live to a world of increasing passive investment,  what does that mean for small company research?</p><p>SOWERBY:  Great, but always beware of the active manager who walks in  and talks about this being a great stock picker's market.  You'll never  hear me say the word stock picker's market, but in this environment we've  seen active management now since last July start to gain better footing,  2017 its gaining better footing.  The macro backdrop is a better tailwind  to good active managers.  And last and most important, if you're active, be  active, don't be a coward and be a closet indexer.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Theresa May has just started speaking in the U.K.  The  British Prime Minister on her feet talking about sensibly the gig economy,  talking about what is happening here in terms of the changes that are  taking place in the U.K.  Let's take a listen to exactly what she has to  say.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  This is a special moment, we have Howard Ward with us of  Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles, two different worlds of  larger cap and mid cap, small cap.  I want to open it up, and Howard Ward I  want to start with you.  Back to what you and I remember, which is, people  loved the comfort of owning general dynamics.  And eclipse (ph) into his  world, people used to like to go out and find stocks that weren't that  familiar, where did that go, how did we get away from individual stock  enthusiasm in America?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Are protected from momentum, are you protected from any  potential shock (ph) there?</p><p>SOWERBY:  No.  No.  We know and markets do correct.  The rule of thumb  is small cap, mid cap stocks will go down more because of their economic  sensitivity.</p><p>KEENE:  Let me show a chart here, I did this just for Howard Ward, and  David Sowerby you're going to love this.  This is the Ibbotson chart, I use  the Dow here, and this goes back to 1905, which is when Howard Ward started  working in the market.  These little red arrows are bear markets, that's a  percent change 18 percent.  We got a huge bear market here, the collapse in  1929.  Over here, 1987 you can barely see it there.  And here's the latest  roll over there, how do you handle a bear market, the two of you with the  different class (ph), how do you handle a bear market?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>SOWERBY:  I'll quickly add.  You want the micro to complement the  macro, which is, when I have a hard time finding individual securities  based on the price I'm paying on earnings or cash flow, that's telling me  something quite profound.  And even today, companies on a cash flow basis  are back to the evaluations we saw when the market corrected in 2011, later  2015 and it's telling you that we're overdue for that 5 to 10 percent  hiccup.  And when you can't find good names you start to either hold a  little bit more cash or try to gravitate to overused term higher quality.</p><p>KEENE:  Guy Johnson, jump in here please.</p><p>JOHNSON:  David, let me ask you, are CEOs, the CFOs, are CTOs, are  management buying their own stock right now?</p><p>SOWERBY:  They are but they're buying less than they were a year ago.   Buybacks have declined, importantly dividend growth is still quite healthy  and I want to find companies even in the mid cap range that are growing  their dividends.  The most important thing you can say about CEOs and CFOs,  CFOs is that they're still deploying what we call capital discipline in the  best interest of the shareholder.  And that gives you comfort that we can  still avoid that perennial 20 percent bear market.</p><p>Hiccup, yes, companies are still quite, I think sensible in deploying  their cash.</p><p>KEENE:  We're going to comeback with David Sowerby and Howard Ward  here.  Continue the discussion on your equity market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Let's get back and talk a little bit about what's happening  in these markets right now.  David Sowerby from Loomis Sayles still with  us, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund also still with us as well.  Howard, when  we look at what is happening in the big caps, the money seems to be made at  the moment, not on what's happening really at the headline level but what's  happening at the sector rotation level.  What are you seeing there and  where do you expect to make money going forward?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes absolutely hence the rotation story.  David, if Janet  Yellen continues on rails (ph) to raise rates and we continue to see  negative balance sheet story gathering pace and we start to see maybe a  roll off there, how does that trickle down to the real economy, to the  smaller mid cap companies, how does the cost of capital affect the  businesses that you cover?</p><p>SOWERBY:  They will naturally be more sensitive to higher interest  rates than large company stocks.  Rule of thumb is if the market goes down  5 to 7 percent small caps, mid caps could go down 10 percent.  I think  interest rates for the treacherous interest rate forecast are continuing to  trend higher as they have in the last few weeks.  And I think the Fed  should be raising interest rates.</p><p>The Fed's number one mission is price stability with a stable economy.   And in this period of eight plus, nine years of very low interest rates,  the Fed needs to be very mindful while inflations is quite low, that they  need to start to raise interest rates and a couple of more hikes in 2017.</p><p>JOHNSON:  David, if we were to see the President being able to deliver  on a kind of homeland investment act 2.0 and money starts to comeback, it's  mainly held by the big tech companies that Howard has just been talking  about.  Would that further widen out the gap between the big caps and the  medium and the small cap companies?</p><p>SOWERBY:  I think it actually could be beneficial to the smaller caps  because, as -- the economy has the expectations to grow faster, think back  to the November 8th elections, out of that rally the day after, what led  the market?  Not just small cap but micro caps did even better, and they  were I think the beneficiary of more sensible regulation, corporate tax  reform.</p><p>I think, while that's on hold, if we can still get that done that  would be more beneficial to those cyclicals and that would be in the small  cap area.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Gents we'll have to leave it there, time beats us as ever,  Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles joining us.   Thank you very much indeed, both of you for your time.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

David Sowerby's idea of a large cap is some mid cap, you and I don't know, this is way cool. Howard Ward of GAMCO, and with us joining, from the competitor of Loomis Sayles, David Sowerby. The two of you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOWERBY: There's enough money for --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Do you wish you could be Howard Ward? Do you wish it would just be easy and go after the big visible names like Howard does?</p><p>SOWERBY: No, I'd rather find names where there's five or fewer Wall Street analyst who follow it than the 50 plus who follow Apple. Ideally how much value add can I do in analysis of Apple, not that you can't you certainly can, but I'd rather find names where they're under followed and where they spun out of a larger company and people don't want to own them but there's value there.</p><p>KEENE: How do you go with the steer, I mean I know you said you got a portfolio mandate to do larger companies and all that --</p><p>SOWERBY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: But, you got to love the idea of an information gap that you can take advantage of, as Mr. Sowerby does.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: How do you avoid a value trap, Howard's career is a legacy of value traps he tries to avoid. How do you avoid a mid cap, small cap value trap?</p><p>SOWERBY: I want to avoid a mid cap stock that looks value like that's on its way to small cap. And is the company very shareholder focused? Are they generating return on invested capital, great free cash flow? That really sums it up, are they good on capital discipline, and if that's the case, an evaluation is compelling and the free cash flow is going to improve, then you have a value opportunity and not a value trap.</p><p>JOHNSON: David, we live to a world of increasing passive investment, what does that mean for small company research?</p><p>SOWERBY: Great, but always beware of the active manager who walks in and talks about this being a great stock picker's market. You'll never hear me say the word stock picker's market, but in this environment we've seen active management now since last July start to gain better footing, 2017 its gaining better footing. The macro backdrop is a better tailwind to good active managers. And last and most important, if you're active, be active, don't be a coward and be a closet indexer.</p><p>JOHNSON: Theresa May has just started speaking in the U.K. The British Prime Minister on her feet talking about sensibly the gig economy, talking about what is happening here in terms of the changes that are taking place in the U.K. Let's take a listen to exactly what she has to say.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: This is a special moment, we have Howard Ward with us of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles, two different worlds of larger cap and mid cap, small cap. I want to open it up, and Howard Ward I want to start with you. Back to what you and I remember, which is, people loved the comfort of owning general dynamics. And eclipse (ph) into his world, people used to like to go out and find stocks that weren't that familiar, where did that go, how did we get away from individual stock enthusiasm in America?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Are protected from momentum, are you protected from any potential shock (ph) there?</p><p>SOWERBY: No. No. We know and markets do correct. The rule of thumb is small cap, mid cap stocks will go down more because of their economic sensitivity.</p><p>KEENE: Let me show a chart here, I did this just for Howard Ward, and David Sowerby you're going to love this. This is the Ibbotson chart, I use the Dow here, and this goes back to 1905, which is when Howard Ward started working in the market. These little red arrows are bear markets, that's a percent change 18 percent. We got a huge bear market here, the collapse in 1929. Over here, 1987 you can barely see it there. And here's the latest roll over there, how do you handle a bear market, the two of you with the different class (ph), how do you handle a bear market?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>SOWERBY: I'll quickly add. You want the micro to complement the macro, which is, when I have a hard time finding individual securities based on the price I'm paying on earnings or cash flow, that's telling me something quite profound. And even today, companies on a cash flow basis are back to the evaluations we saw when the market corrected in 2011, later 2015 and it's telling you that we're overdue for that 5 to 10 percent hiccup. And when you can't find good names you start to either hold a little bit more cash or try to gravitate to overused term higher quality.</p><p>KEENE: Guy Johnson, jump in here please.</p><p>JOHNSON: David, let me ask you, are CEOs, the CFOs, are CTOs, are management buying their own stock right now?</p><p>SOWERBY: They are but they're buying less than they were a year ago. Buybacks have declined, importantly dividend growth is still quite healthy and I want to find companies even in the mid cap range that are growing their dividends. The most important thing you can say about CEOs and CFOs, CFOs is that they're still deploying what we call capital discipline in the best interest of the shareholder. And that gives you comfort that we can still avoid that perennial 20 percent bear market.</p><p>Hiccup, yes, companies are still quite, I think sensible in deploying their cash.</p><p>KEENE: We're going to comeback with David Sowerby and Howard Ward here. Continue the discussion on your equity market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Let's get back and talk a little bit about what's happening in these markets right now. David Sowerby from Loomis Sayles still with us, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund also still with us as well. Howard, when we look at what is happening in the big caps, the money seems to be made at the moment, not on what's happening really at the headline level but what's happening at the sector rotation level. What are you seeing there and where do you expect to make money going forward?</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes absolutely hence the rotation story. David, if Janet Yellen continues on rails (ph) to raise rates and we continue to see negative balance sheet story gathering pace and we start to see maybe a roll off there, how does that trickle down to the real economy, to the smaller mid cap companies, how does the cost of capital affect the businesses that you cover?</p><p>SOWERBY: They will naturally be more sensitive to higher interest rates than large company stocks. Rule of thumb is if the market goes down 5 to 7 percent small caps, mid caps could go down 10 percent. I think interest rates for the treacherous interest rate forecast are continuing to trend higher as they have in the last few weeks. And I think the Fed should be raising interest rates.</p><p>The Fed's number one mission is price stability with a stable economy. And in this period of eight plus, nine years of very low interest rates, the Fed needs to be very mindful while inflations is quite low, that they need to start to raise interest rates and a couple of more hikes in 2017.</p><p>JOHNSON: David, if we were to see the President being able to deliver on a kind of homeland investment act 2.0 and money starts to comeback, it's mainly held by the big tech companies that Howard has just been talking about. Would that further widen out the gap between the big caps and the medium and the small cap companies?</p><p>SOWERBY: I think it actually could be beneficial to the smaller caps because, as -- the economy has the expectations to grow faster, think back to the November 8th elections, out of that rally the day after, what led the market? Not just small cap but micro caps did even better, and they were I think the beneficiary of more sensible regulation, corporate tax reform.</p><p>I think, while that's on hold, if we can still get that done that would be more beneficial to those cyclicals and that would be in the small cap area.</p><p>JOHNSON: Gents we'll have to leave it there, time beats us as ever, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles joining us. Thank you very much indeed, both of you for your time.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The two of you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SOWERBY:  There's enough money for --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  KEENE:  Do you wish you could be Howard Ward?  Do you wish it would  just be easy and go after the big visible names like Howard does?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  No, I'd rather find names where there's five or fewer Wall  Street analyst who follow it than the 50 plus who follow Apple.  Ideally  how much value add can I do in analysis of Apple, not that you can't you  certainly can, but I'd rather find names where they're under followed and  where they spun out of a larger company and people don't want to own them  but there's value there.</p><p>  KEENE:  How do you go with the steer, I mean I know you said you got a  portfolio mandate to do larger companies and all that --</p><p>  SOWERBY:  Yes.</p><p>  KEENE:  But, you got to love the idea of an information gap that you  can take advantage of, as Mr. Sowerby does.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  KEENE:  How do you avoid a value trap, Howard's career is a legacy of  value traps he tries to avoid.  How do you avoid a mid cap, small cap value  trap?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  I want to avoid a mid cap stock that looks value like that's  on its way to small cap.  And is the company very shareholder focused?  Are  they generating return on invested capital, great free cash flow?  That  really sums it up, are they good on capital discipline, and if that's the  case, an evaluation is compelling and the free cash flow is going to  improve, then you have a value opportunity and not a value trap.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  David, we live to a world of increasing passive investment,  what does that mean for small company research?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  Great, but always beware of the active manager who walks in  and talks about this being a great stock picker's market.  You'll never  hear me say the word stock picker's market, but in this environment we've  seen active management now since last July start to gain better footing,  2017 its gaining better footing.  The macro backdrop is a better tailwind  to good active managers.  And last and most important, if you're active, be  active, don't be a coward and be a closet indexer.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Theresa May has just started speaking in the U.K.  The  British Prime Minister on her feet talking about sensibly the gig economy,  talking about what is happening here in terms of the changes that are  taking place in the U.K.  Let's take a listen to exactly what she has to  say.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  KEENE:  This is a special moment, we have Howard Ward with us of  Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles, two different worlds of  larger cap and mid cap, small cap.  I want to open it up, and Howard Ward I  want to start with you.  Back to what you and I remember, which is, people  loved the comfort of owning general dynamics.  And eclipse (ph) into his  world, people used to like to go out and find stocks that weren't that  familiar, where did that go, how did we get away from individual stock  enthusiasm in America?</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  KEENE:  Are protected from momentum, are you protected from any  potential shock (ph) there?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  No.  No.  We know and markets do correct.  The rule of thumb  is small cap, mid cap stocks will go down more because of their economic  sensitivity.</p><p>  KEENE:  Let me show a chart here, I did this just for Howard Ward, and  David Sowerby you're going to love this.  This is the Ibbotson chart, I use  the Dow here, and this goes back to 1905, which is when Howard Ward started  working in the market.  These little red arrows are bear markets, that's a  percent change 18 percent.  We got a huge bear market here, the collapse in  1929.  Over here, 1987 you can barely see it there.  And here's the latest  roll over there, how do you handle a bear market, the two of you with the  different class (ph), how do you handle a bear market?</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  SOWERBY:  I'll quickly add.  You want the micro to complement the  macro, which is, when I have a hard time finding individual securities  based on the price I'm paying on earnings or cash flow, that's telling me  something quite profound.  And even today, companies on a cash flow basis  are back to the evaluations we saw when the market corrected in 2011, later  2015 and it's telling you that we're overdue for that 5 to 10 percent  hiccup.  And when you can't find good names you start to either hold a  little bit more cash or try to gravitate to overused term higher quality.</p><p>  KEENE:  Guy Johnson, jump in here please.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  David, let me ask you, are CEOs, the CFOs, are CTOs, are  management buying their own stock right now?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  They are but they're buying less than they were a year ago.   Buybacks have declined, importantly dividend growth is still quite healthy  and I want to find companies even in the mid cap range that are growing  their dividends.  The most important thing you can say about CEOs and CFOs,  CFOs is that they're still deploying what we call capital discipline in the  best interest of the shareholder.  And that gives you comfort that we can  still avoid that perennial 20 percent bear market.</p><p>  Hiccup, yes, companies are still quite, I think sensible in deploying  their cash.</p><p>  KEENE:  We're going to comeback with David Sowerby and Howard Ward  here.  Continue the discussion on your equity market.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Let's get back and talk a little bit about what's happening  in these markets right now.  David Sowerby from Loomis Sayles still with  us, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund also still with us as well.  Howard, when  we look at what is happening in the big caps, the money seems to be made at  the moment, not on what's happening really at the headline level but what's  happening at the sector rotation level.  What are you seeing there and  where do you expect to make money going forward?</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Yes absolutely hence the rotation story.  David, if Janet  Yellen continues on rails (ph) to raise rates and we continue to see  negative balance sheet story gathering pace and we start to see maybe a  roll off there, how does that trickle down to the real economy, to the  smaller mid cap companies, how does the cost of capital affect the  businesses that you cover?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  They will naturally be more sensitive to higher interest  rates than large company stocks.  Rule of thumb is if the market goes down  5 to 7 percent small caps, mid caps could go down 10 percent.  I think  interest rates for the treacherous interest rate forecast are continuing to  trend higher as they have in the last few weeks.  And I think the Fed  should be raising interest rates.</p><p>  The Fed's number one mission is price stability with a stable economy.   And in this period of eight plus, nine years of very low interest rates,  the Fed needs to be very mindful while inflations is quite low, that they  need to start to raise interest rates and a couple of more hikes in 2017.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  David, if we were to see the President being able to deliver  on a kind of homeland investment act 2.0 and money starts to comeback, it's  mainly held by the big tech companies that Howard has just been talking  about.  Would that further widen out the gap between the big caps and the  medium and the small cap companies?</p><p>  SOWERBY:  I think it actually could be beneficial to the smaller caps  because, as -- the economy has the expectations to grow faster, think back  to the November 8th elections, out of that rally the day after, what led  the market?  Not just small cap but micro caps did even better, and they  were I think the beneficiary of more sensible regulation, corporate tax  reform.</p><p>  I think, while that's on hold, if we can still get that done that  would be more beneficial to those cyclicals and that would be in the small  cap area.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Gents we'll have to leave it there, time beats us as ever,  Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles joining us.   Thank you very much indeed, both of you for your time.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

A new public authority, guided by ten regulatory principles, must be set up to instil a new culture of ethics into the design of online services, such as social media platforms, according to the Lords' communications committee. The Lords' 85-page report took nine months to compile and was published less than two weeks before the government is due to release its own proposals[1] in the form of an 'online harms' white paper. It claims that a dozen UK regulators, including Ofcom and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)[2], have partial remit over tech firms like Facebook and Google. </p><p>But there's a marked absence of a single body with complete oversight of these companies.This analysis, alongside an acceptance that 'self-regulation' has failed, means digital regulation is highly fragmented, with several gaps and overlaps. Online harm, in particular, ranging from fast-spreading extremist material to content affecting children's mental health, is an area that big tech companies have \"failed to adequately tackle\" themselves. \"The impact of technology, the pace and change that comes with it, and the size and scale and speed of the tech companies meant in our view that we had an analogue regulatory regime for a digital era,\" committee chair Lord Gilbert told IT Pro. \"That's why we say there should be a powerful Digital Authority that is not yet another regulator, but one which pulls together all the existing regulatory work and makes sure things are being dealt with.\" \"[The organisation would] build a British centre of expertise so that we've got the skills required in the regulatory regime to understand what's really happening inside the tech companies, and what they're doing. \"Really importantly, [it needs to] have a horizon scanning capacity, so public policy making and regulation is looking toward the future and the issues that may arise as tech develops, rather than just responding to newspaper headlines.\"'Horizon scanning' a fragmented landscapeEstablishing a new industry regulator is not a novel idea, with both the Labour Party[3]and the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee[4] each demanding variations of this. But the House of Lords has called for the creation of a pan-public sector organisation that would oversee existing regulators, fill any regulatory gaps, and feed into establishing new rules and powers where necessary. Dubbed the 'Digital Authority', this body would co-ordinate the existing regulatory landscape, make recommendations, and report frequently to a joint committee of MPs and Lords. \"Policy-makers across different sectors have not responded adequately to changes in the digital world,\" the report said. \"The Digital Authority should be empowered to instruct regulators to address specific problems or areas. \"In cases where this is not possible because problems are not within the remit of any regulator, the Digital Authority should advise the Government and Parliament that new or strengthened legal powers are needed.\" This approach has been devised in direct response to an emerging challenge that regulators face; of the friction between their existing remits and powers created in an analogue age, and the increasingly online-centric world. The report has recommended this first step of establishing a 'Digital Authority' in order to consolidate and co-ordinate the remit of the ICO, Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The body will then review these regulators' existing powers, and may in the future recommend establishing an entirely new regulator.'Self-regulation has failed'Among the ten principles guiding any new regulatory body include parity, accountability, transparency, openness, privacy, and ethical design. More substantive elements are recognition of childhood, respect for human rights and equality, education and awareness-raising, and democratic accountability, proportionality and evidence-based approach. These are principles the House of Lords select committee feels tech companies have not been abiding by in the digital products and services they design. This partially informs an understanding that self-regulation, where companies police themselves, has failed. Lord Gilbert added that there wasn't a particular instance that proved to him self-regulation had failed. Rather, it was the idea that issues such as dealing with online harm and respecting data rights, were so broad and significant that they naturally demanded a co-regulatory or regulatory approach. \"There's a job for parliament here,\" he added. \"Parliament has got a job, not to interfere day-to-day in individual regulatory cases, but to set societal expectations so that regulators have a sense of priorities.\"Deconcentrating powerMeanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg's stated intention to merge Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram[5] is exactly the kind of consolidation the report has raised a red flag against. Witnesses giving evidence raised concerns that traditional rules around competition and monopolisation, which the CMA adjudicates over, were not effective for a digital age. The report outlined steps the government should take to create and enforce a public interest test for data-driven mergers and acquisitions. This will prevent large companies from becoming \"data monopolies\". The CMA can currently intervene in cases relevant to media plurality and national security, but the report said this should be extended to include mergers in the context of digital markets as well. Moreover, these companies effectively serve as \"gatekeepers for the internet\" comparable to utilities like gas and water. Special obligations, therefore, must be drawn up to ensure they act fairly to users, to other companies and behave in the interests of wider society. A DCMS spokesperson said the government will release its forthcoming online harms white paper during Winter this year.

Transparency, where powerful businesses and organisations operating in the digital world must be open to scrutiny; and Recognition of childhood, where the most vulnerable users of the internet should be protected.The report said that the new authority should leave regulators, such as the ICO, Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority, to continue their work.The tasks of the new authority should include oversight of the full spectrum of regulation; recommend new legislation when there are gaps; mediate when there are overlaps; and report to Parliament regularly on the state of regulation of the internet.The report has also recommended several changes to existing regulations, including a new public interest test for data-driven mergers and acquisitions; protect the public from having data bought and sold without consent; and new powers for the ICO to audit the use of algorithms in decision making by technology companies.The committee has also said that services should provide strictest privacy and safety settings by default, which users can then voluntarily lower.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-1E71DFD9E2584AB39266E3FB1274AEAB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMF-18W1-JC0X-H2VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><timeReceived>1:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He called for a \u201cfar more ambitious set of regulatory structures for data capitalism\u201d saying that \u201cThe big tech companies have for far too long got away with the conceit that they are simply neutral platforms. They are not. They are active media and information companies, and their stock market valuations are based on the data flows they generate and how they can be monetised. With that role surely should come broader societal responsibilities, but the Bill does not go into this area at all.\u201d  <br/>He noted that the GDPR itself is not printed in the Bill and was concerned that this is a bad precedent in light of Brexit. \u201cThere is a gap in procedures - no usual evidence taking sessions this time. I suggest that the Committee looks carefully at the GDPR and this Bill. It would help the House to understand what is going to happen if we leave the common market, how can we secure unhindered data flows?\u201d  <br/>Lord  Stevenson of Balmacara said that we are facing a legislative nightmare. \u201cThe DP bills fails to say how it will ensure data flows. Adequacy is the only card to play but how, as the bill does not address this? UK surveillance arrangements may jeopardise adequacy.\u201d  <br/>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN296257620171014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR0-MM61-J9XT-P1WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 14, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He called for a \u201cfar more ambitious set of regulatory structures for data capitalism\u201d saying that \u201cThe big tech companies have for far too long got away with the conceit that they are simply neutral platforms. They are not. They are active media and information companies, and their stock market valuations are based on the data flows they generate and how they can be monetised. With that role surely should come broader societal responsibilities, but the Bill does not go into this area at all.\u201d  <br/>He noted that the GDPR itself is not printed in the Bill and was concerned that this is a bad precedent in light of Brexit. \u201cThere is a gap in procedures - no usual evidence taking sessions this time. I suggest that the Committee looks carefully at the GDPR and this Bill. It would help the House to understand what is going to happen if we leave the common market, how can we secure unhindered data flows?\u201d  <br/>Lord  Stevenson of Balmacara said that we are facing a legislative nightmare. \u201cThe DP bills fails to say how it will ensure data flows. Adequacy is the only card to play but how, as the bill does not address this? UK surveillance arrangements may jeopardise adequacy.\u201d  <br/>He said that a single piece of legislation is welcome but there are areas to address such as social media companies\u2019 impact on elections, and fake news.  <br/>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN289597820171011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPH-7Y71-J9XT-P0K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 11, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But the Lords also called for greater access to public sector data for AI researchers and developers, to allow them to compete with established giants. </p><p>Related content </p><p> Major report urges government to create dedicated AI programme for public sector </p><p> Government promises 'deep transformation' in long-awaited strategy </p><p> Government recruits for 'public face' of AI </p><p>\"In many cases, this will require government departments and public organisations making a concerted effort to digitise their records in unified and compatible formats,\" they added. </p><p>The NHS and the Ordnance Survey were picked out by the peers as public institutions with particularly comprehensive data collections, but they highlighted problems, for example that many NHS records are still in paper form and digitisation would be expensive and time-consuming. </p><p>In a report published this week, and put together after interviewing experts, the committee praised some initiatives already taking place in government to boost the AI industry. It welcomed the introduction of a GovTech Catalyst team - which oversees a \u00a320m fund to help tech firms deliver innovative solutions to public sector problems - and said it hoped it would be able to \"open the doors of Whitehall to the burgeoning AI development sector in the UK\". </p><p>It also highlighted to the independent report on growing the UK's AI community published last October, which recommended greater use of AI in the public sector. </p><p>But it called for public procurement regulations to be reviewed and amended \"to ensure that UK-based companies offering AI solutions are invited to tender and given the greatest opportunity to participate\". Government should \"be bold\" when procuring AI systems, and should provide support to businesses to convert ideas to prototypes, it added. </p><p>The committee also recommended the establishment of an online bulletin board, where challenges from across Whitehall and the rest of the public sector - identified by the Government Office for AI as having the potential for AI-based solutions - are advertised. </p><p>Start-ups and academia </p><p>Elsewhere in the report, the peers called for \"strategic leadership\" from government on AI, to avoid developing \"overlapping and conflicting\" policies and institutions. The Government Office for AI, they said, should develop a national policy framework for AI, which should be \"in lockstep with the Industrial Strategy\". </p><p>They also said the Government Office for AI should coordinate work between the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the GovTech Catalyst team and the national research centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (the Alan Turing Institute), as well as the AI Council it was established to support. </p><p>The report also touched on the difficulty for government in attracting AI experts, because it can't match the salaries offered by the private sector. </p><p>Lord Clement-Jones, committee chair, said the UK would be able to take advantage of the benefits of AI and lead on its \"ethical development\" internationally - if it took up the recommendations put forward by the Lords committee. </p><p>He added: \"The UK contains leading AI companies, a dynamic academic research culture, and a vigorous start-up ecosystem as well as a host of legal, ethical, financial and linguistic strengths. We should make the most of this environment, but it is essential that ethics take centre stage in AI's development and use. </p><p>\"AI is not without its risks and the adoption of the principles proposed by the committee will help to mitigate these. An ethical approach ensures the public trusts this technology and sees the benefits of using it. It will also prepare them to challenge its misuse.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PBTNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PBTNET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4F-H7N1-JD3S-J2XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><timeReceived>6:24 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PublicTechnology (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 18, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLGK</classCode><className>PUBLIC RECORDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001425</classCode><className>PUBLIC CONTRACTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RMD</classCode><className>PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA5QTlFMDVCQUY0NEY0NUE1QzMyQzA1QkQyQzJGRUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Public Contracts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000388</classCode><className>CONTRACTS &amp;

It is Wednesday, April 3rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jobs in America, next hour. we're getting March ADP report, the expectation is for the private sector to have added 170,000 jobs in the month of March. It is the first look at the labor market ahead of the jobs report on Friday. Yes, jobs Friday is coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump touting the strength of the economy last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thanks to our bold agenda we enacted with House Republicans, America now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We're the hottest in the world.</p><p>Wherever I meet a president, a prime minister, anybody, they say congratulations on your economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Investors are also waiting on a China trade development, another round of high level talks today kick off. I've learned that the two sides are close to a memorandum of understanding. The bulk of the issues have now been agreed upon.</p><p>The optimism driving markets this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, take a look. Dow Industrials up about 100 points right now, a third of a percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 13.5. And the Nasdaq up 40 points currently.</p><p>This after mixed action yesterday. The Dow was down 80 points yesterday, take a look. That was due to Walgreens and a big selloff on that because of earnings worries.</p><p>The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 closed flat at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning. First Europe: FT 100 has gone negative. It's down 1.25 points, fractional move obviously. CAC 40 in Paris is up 30 points, one-half of 1 percent. The DAX index in Germany is up 134 points, that's better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the numbers were largely higher. Take a look. Best performer in China, Shanghai composite up 1.25 percent.</p><p>Major changes coming to airport security. Now you will be able to keep your laptop in your carry-on. What you need to know before your next flight.</p><p>And then back in court, actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman will appear before a judge in the college admissions scandal.</p><p>And a phone plan for your kids, details on Verizon's new offering coming up later this hour.</p><p>And then this, a night at the museum really. How you can spend the night at the Louvre in Paris.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and ThirdSeven Advisors, market strategist, Michael Block.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRDSEVEN ADVISORS: Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here. Lots to talk about on the economy. We were talking about the fed earlier. And one of the issues we haven't hit on yet this morning is the idea of a closed border with Mexico. What impact would that have on the economy?</p><p>You know, some of the reports coming out of Washington these days are that President Trump's advisors are talking about maybe just closing down -- keeping open commercial traffic but closing down individual traffic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It still is a big risk for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a big risk. It's going to obviously impact a lot and we're already looking at a situation where things are slowing in the U.S.</p><p>And we are right on the doorstep of earnings. I spoke with Oracle CEO Mark Hurd earlier. I sat down yesterday with him to discuss the U.S. and European economies. Why Oracle is buying back so much stock. And where he sees growth now because we are on the doorstep of earnings. And wanted to get a sense from him about the international slowdown that we're talking about.</p><p>But we began with NetSuite, Oracle's investment in the applications market as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us what you're getting from your customers this week there in Las Vegas and about NetSuite.</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE: Sure. Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>Yes, you're right. I mean we've invested a lot in the applications market. We've invested in big and small segments of the market, big customers and small customers. We acquired NetSuite. Gosh, I don't know, probably two and-a-half years ago now and it's really been an amazing success, to your point.</p><p>There's, I don't know, less than 10,000 but roughly that number of customers here for our event. It is very exciting. When we bought NetSuite, Maria, the company was growing about 15, 16 percent in revenue. We've invested a lot in R&amp;D. We've invested a lot in tailoring the application for more industries. We've added salespeople.</p><p>And it's resulted in just incredible growth. starting really about a year ago. So about a year into the acquisition we began to really grow our bookings and that's now translated to revenue. So last quarter we reported revenue that was almost double the revenue growth we had coming into the acquisition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean you're seeing it in the numbers. The applications business is soaring right now at Oracle, as your customers move from on- premise to Cloud.</p><p>Take us behind the curtain there. What kind of companies are moving from on-premise to Cloud? How do you continue getting them to switch over into the Oracle Cloud? And how significant is this in terms of the applications business at Oracle?</p><p>HURD: There's a couple of phenomena going on at the same time. The applications market is about $125 billion spent primarily on applications and you're exactly right. Most of it today is spent on on-premise applications.</p><p>That market changes though pretty significantly as it moves to Cloud. Because as it moves to Cloud the subscription you pay for the Cloud includes not only the application but includes all the hardware if you will, the servers, the storage.</p><p>And so it becomes a bigger market just by the very nature of the migration of the application to SAS.</p><p>Now inside that $125 billion, about $70 billion, $75 billion is back off us. That would be described as, you know, things like general ledger, accounting and supply chain and procurement and HR. And the other 25 to 30 percent is funneled more like sales automation and marketing automation.</p><p>NetSuite is played in the sort of mid-market, smaller customers, size of that back off as market. And it's had explosive growth And so when you ask who's moving it's really everybody from the biggest guys whether those be as big as An AT&amp;T and Extreme -- I could through many others to your small startup.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you trying to get this applications of companies to move just to the Oracle Cloud or are you trying to get all applications to move to the Cloud or are you just looking at the Oracle portions of the business? How do you grow this even more is really the bottom line?</p><p>HURD: So if you look today, half of the Cloud application customers we have were roughly or half of our revenue, that's a better way to describe it, came from our base and about half came from outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. What about the database of business, Mark, because a lot of people are less excited about this because it's growing a lot slower than what you see in the numbers that you see in the applications business. You've got new products here in terms of the database business.</p><p>But is that going to get you to show stronger growth numbers? Even your cap ex is so much lower than some of your competitors. What are you spending, $2 billion a year or so on capital expenditures. Microsoft spending $10 billion. Can you keep spending that kind of money to improve the database business?</p><p>HURD: I'm very excited about the database business. The reason you get all of this excitement about the apps business is we've been at it longer with this next gen product and we're winning. And it shows up in the numbers. It shows up in analyst reports. So people talk about that a lot.</p><p>And the data business we've released a new product called the autonomous database. And the autonomous database, how would I give you a good example? It would be like now somebody doing all the work for you, all of that latency, all of that risk of security and concern goes away in one move.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>HURD: And the database is now automatically tuned. There are millions of database administrators out there tuning Oracle database as we speak. The a autonomous database will self-tune. This is an iterative process. This is not a one tiny game. This is all driven by artificial intelligence.</p><p>So AI is integrated into the autonomous database so the database will get smarter, smarter and smarter and smarter, performance will get better and better and better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But while it's getting smarter and you're taking market share, the world is slowing. I mean, Europe is lucky to get 1 percent growth this year. China we've seen the numbers, that's come down. Asia, throughout Asia, actually, not just China. We're seeing the numbers in the U.S. As well.</p><p>So how are you characterizing the environment right now? What are you seeing out there in terms of your customers and whether or not they have the ability or desire to spend more money on all of this?</p><p>HURD: I think the U.S. Is good. I think the U.S. Has been solid for a while. I think the thing we opened up with, NetSuite is a great example of the U.S. Economy. Most of NetSuite is sold into small and medium business. Mostly companies that are domestic and their growth is outstanding. They are investing.</p><p>And so we see strength in the U.S. We see sort of the same picture you're describing in Europe. I think the good news for us is that's what the picture we've seen for a while. It really isn't new news to us. We see some pretty exciting stuff in Latin America. So we see a little bit different picture of the world depending on where -- in terms of where we go.</p><p>But we see the U.S. stronger than what we've seen in the last few years. Europe roughly the same. Pockets of Asia and Latin America that are quite positive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes but investors want to see better growth, right? I mean when you look at the numbers, you've got great 50 percent share in the database market. You look broadly speaking, big picture -- 400,000 customers, more than 145 countries You're one of the largest technology companies in the world but despite this long stretch of economic growth that we've all been talking about, Oracle's reported revenue has missed estimates. So how do you get the revenue accelerating from here -- Mark?</p><p>HURD: Yes, I don't know that we've missed estimates but we haven't grown as fast as I think people to your point would like. And that's really because we've changed our company.</p><p>We've done a couple things that are probably not all that popular in the sense that we've significantly increased our R&amp;D. And we've also taken the decision to exit some of our older businesses and invest in the new businesses. So there is no -- Oracle, probably over the last two or three years has grown about 3 percent, three and change, that's constant currency number.</p><p>And there's no business in the company growing at that rate. So what we do is have businesses growing like our ERP back office, Cloud business growing 70 percent. We have our NetSuite business growing 30 percent. Autonomous database is going to grow a gajilion percent.</p><p>Now at the same times -- Our hardware business that we've sort off which -- not de-emphasized. We're very focused on our exo-data business but some of the businesses we acquired years backward up. Those business climbing 25 and 30.</p><p>And so The company is a combination of the businesses we're growing are getting bigger and the businesses that are shrinking are getting smaller.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ok.</p><p>HURT: So as a result, I expect 2019 will grow, the company will grow faster than 2018. And in 2020 I expect the company to grow faster than 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, though-out it all -- you're backing back a ton of stock. Last quarter you bought back more than 5 percent of the company's shares. In the first quarter of 2018. You had 10 million shares a year ago. Is there any particular reason you're so aggressive on buying back the stock and is that still the best use of cash?</p><p>HURD: Well, we produce a lot of cash, as you he know. And we think, you know, we've got choices. We actually increased our dividend. Huawei we've been buying back stock. We love the price of our stock at this level.</p><p>BARTIROMO: what are you at, $60 billion in total cash? Net cash of $6.6 billion last quarter. Are you willing to take on debt to continue buying back the stock?</p><p>HURD: I probably won't comment on that today, other than to say that we would continue to be active in buying the stock at these levels. I don't want to get into discrete metrics and so forth. But you know, we're very excited about the opportunity to buy the stock back at this price.</p><p>I mean I think it ties back to your earlier thesis, which I think is the right thesis. There's so many metrics, you know all these in the marketplace about what drives -- what multiples drive what stock price.</p><p>And I think ours really is a revenue growth story. I think when you look at our multiple against cash flow, operating cash flow which is one that I use a lot, you'll find that we're sort of a little bit in the penalty box and I think that has to do with that absolute growth rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what kind of a year are you expecting -- Mark? Give us your sense, given the fact that so many people are talking about a recession on the horizon, Europe lucky to squeak by on growth, China as well. What do you think?</p><p>HURT: You know, I'm still not negative. I'm still very -- I'm very positive on the U.S. I think -- you well know, there are things we could do to make this more and more difficult. But I think when you look at the fundamentals of the U.S., at least to me they look pretty darn solid. My view of Europe is Europe took a slow path out of this and they're getting the results you would expect out of that. I don't see a major change in Europe to the negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's pretty interesting what Europe is doing in terms of technology companies. Social media in particular. It's a lot more harsh than the U.S. Has been on the regulatory front, hasn't it?</p><p>HURD: Yes, I mean, listen, their concerns continue to be about the consumer, most of what you're talking about is on the consumer side. It affects the enterprise as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And my thanks to Oracle's CEO, Mark Hurd.</p><p>We will take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, major changes for airport security, new scanners rolling out across the country today. What it means for your laptops liquids coming up.</p><p>Then the college admissions scandal, celebrities Lorie Loughlin and Felicity Huffman are in court today. We're taking a look at the case against them. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Major changes to airport security across the country today. . Cheryl Casone on headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, a new 3D security scanners, Maria are going to be having to hundreds of airports across the country. They're so sophisticated you may not have to take the laptop or small liquids out of carry-on bags anymore. The 3D technology allowing TSA agents to can rotate the images digitally.</p><p>Well, Theresa May looking for another delay in Britain's effort to leave the European union. The British prime minister announcing she wants to make a deal with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to break the logjam in parliament.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I'm offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree on a plan that we would both stick to, to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: May says that she's going to seek an extension until May 22. Right now Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U. on April 12. Corbyn says he will be very happy to sit down with May. Progress possibly happening there.</p><p>And then here is quite an offer from Charmin. A forever roll of toilet paper. The one and a quarter pound roll is built to last a full month. There's a catch, that's for one user. Somehow they figure this stuff out. I don't know. The cost -- $5.49 a roll. Charmin also offering two-pound multiuser $9.99 and then if you get the luxury hold you have to have a special dispenser. You can buy that as part of the starter pack if you so desire.</p><p>Some folks, it's important --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I don't know -- how long before AOC decides to ban toilet paper. Bad for the environment.</p><p>The day for everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, a cell phone plan just for kids, grown-ups are still in control though. Details on Verizon's new offering coming up.</p><p>And then a health food start-up that's not targeting millennials. The plant based drink focuses on seniors. We're going to check it out. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Food startup targeting an unlikely market -- Perennial is the non-dairy drink designed for seniors.</p><p>Joining us now is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski: Also known as Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKY, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: good to see you.</p><p>So plant-based just for seniors.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes. So you know, you hear the Ensure shakes, the boost shakes which are calorie boosting shakes that have protein in them, have been a viable alternative for seniors for a really long time, from about the 1970s.</p><p>Now companies are coming in and saying let's make some health food alternatives that have different ingredients to target this new uprising in marketing that allows people to have flexibility in the types of foods they're consuming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's definitely gaining a lot of popularity, the plant- based diet, right, Dagen, right Dagen. I mean you do this regularly. But I think now it's gone mainstream.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is. And this is an untouched demographic, seniors or older Americans. I was reading an article, 1 percent of global innovation targets adults over the age of 50. And these are the people who have money to spend, are going to probably -- more focused on their nutrition.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: They are focused on their nutrition. And I want them to become even more excited about this because primary prevention is the way that we're going to not only save money, but see true results from our healthcare system.</p><p>I would much rather someone changed their diet, changed their nutrition habits and not have a heart attack as opposed to treat their heart attack once it came to fruition.</p><p>HILSENRATH: For meteors like myself, when we see all these plant-based trends, should I be feeling guilty or that I'm neglecting my body because I'm still going out, devouring steaks and chicken.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well no, the is actually in the kind of hatred that's directed at people who choose to eat plant-based foods.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm not hating. I'm wondering if I'm destroying my body.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is so much ridicule directed at people who say I choose a vegan diet. I don't understand it. Maybe they just enjoy shaming people who choose not to eat meat. It's very weird.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: I think that hate goes both ways. If you log onto social media community and you have someone make a video on their diet and they're consuming fish or meat, the vegan community will come after them just as much as they will come after --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a very, very small group of people, considering how many vegans there are. Make a video on their diet and they're consuming fish or meat, the vegan community will come after them as much as the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: A very small group of people, considering how many vegans there are.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: But also, the important thing to note is we have to define our terms here. Plant-based doesn't necessarily mean vegan. For example, I advocate for a whole food plant based diet. That's a plant-focused diet TSO so that the majority of your calories should be coming from plant-based foods.</p><p>But I still I advocate that you can eat lean et meats like chicken and fish. That's a quality source of protein and you don't necessarily have to cut that out.</p><p>BLOCK: Mike -- a lot of doctors like you are embracing this, they're becoming well-known and this is becoming a bigger part of the mainstream as Maria pointed out up front. Are there other countries other than the U.S. Where this has become more prevalent, is there anything we can learn in terms of the experience there in terms of the benefits of plant-based die etcetera for all age groups?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: When you look at the international community and nutrition research, it actually is really upsetting to me as a doctor on how bad that research is. You have studies that come out that say if you eat food x it's going to decrease the likelihood of you getting cancer by 20 percent. If you don't eat food x, it's going to increase your chance of cancer. All of these statistics are nonsense. It's very difficult to take that research and then apply it to the individual sitting in front of you.</p><p>So we just need to be smart, we need to be rational when it comes to nutrition science. And understand that moderation is still the best medicine. A plant-based diet where you're eating plants, vegetables, fruit as the majority of our calories that's a smart way to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this is all the rage though, I'm sure you having to say about this is paleo, but Paleo which is meat based which is the kind of nuevo neo uber Atkins diet.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's Keto right. Keto is almost Keto is also --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's Keto and Atkins sort of the same</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: I mean not necessarily exactly the same. They sometimes have similar food that people are consuming but the idea behind all these marketing fads is that that's what they are. They're just fads that people get very excited because they saw someone that's a celebrity lose weight on a diet and they think this is the way I'm going to lose weight.</p><p>There's nothing magical about keto. It's the fact that you're eating high fat foods, therefore consuming less calories, therefore lose weight.</p><p>So it's not about thinking that there's some sort of a magic pill out there that's going to cure everything that ails you. It's about being smart, controlling your portions and eating a healthy diet.</p><p>BLOCK: I would also point out that, you know, different people can digest things differently.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Absolutely.</p><p>BLOCK: That's a big thing as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You started eating less meat.</p><p>BLOCK: I'm eating less red meat and yes, I'm happier. I figured that out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:: I still want to eat steaks and burgers.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Good for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You might feel better if you didn't eat as many. Just saying.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Every person handles meat differently.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon hates me.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Every person handles meat differently. Statistics have shown pretty clearly, if you're consuming many portions, I'm talking everyday portions of steak, you are increasing some circumstantial evidence for cancer. But that is over a lifetime. That's eating it every day. If you're being smart and you're eating steak with let's say green, leafy vegetables, preparing it in a way where you decrease how much the steak is burned on the grill. You are mitigating that risk and you can still eat healthy --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Sugar is a big thing we need to cut out, right.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Added sugar is all --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HILSENRATH: We can agree on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And unfortunately carbs turning to sugar, so that's the problem. Dr. Mike -- good to see you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Good to see you. Thank you so much -- Maria.</p><p>BILLIANS: Coming up, the college admissions scandal, actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman both in court today. We're taking a look at the charges against them in this scandal.</p><p>Then, hanging with Mona Lisa, AirBNB has history fans rejoicing, details on how you can spend the night in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, April 3rd. Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We are awaiting key economic data this morning. We've got the March ADP report due out in just under an hour from now. Economists are expecting job creation of 170,000 jobs to have been added to the private sector in the month of March. We'll bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape and show you the impact on markets.</p><p>So far, markets are up this morning, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading on renewed trade optimism. We are expecting a trade deal soon with China. The Dow Industrials are up 123 points, one-half of one percent.</p><p>We're also focused on another round of high level negotiations in Washington, the Beijing officials are in Washington, apparently now in the writing stage of a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and China. They've gotten to everything except the enforcement mechanism that the U.S. needs to put in there to stop China from stealing intellectual property, that is the kicking -- that is the sticking point right now.</p><p>The major indices ended the day mixed yesterday. Walgreens was a major issue for the Dow, it reported weaker than expected earnings yesterday, remember, you heard here yesterday morning. And as a result, the stock traded down, took the Dow Industrials down with it, down 80 points on the Dow.</p><p>Yesterday, the S&amp;P was up a fraction and the NASDAQ as well, up 20 points. In fact, the standard of course was at its highest close in nearly five months.</p><p>European Indices are higher across the board this morning, the FT-100 is up 10 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 35 and the DAX Index in Germany is up 156 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board there as well. As you can see, best performer China, Shanghai Composite up 1-1/4 percent.</p><p>Well, hold the phone, Verizon wireless is unveiling a new smartphone plan designed just for kids, it includes unlimited texting and 20 parental approved contacts. We will tell you when it launches and how much.</p><p>Real estate website Zillow expanding into the mortgage business with a new Home Loans division. Details behind the company's latest push to allow customers to directly buy and sell homes.</p><p>And a once in a lifetime opportunity for Airbnb -- from Airbnb, rather, how you can sleep over at one of the world's most iconic landmarks, the Louvre Museum in Paris, later his hour.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the college admissions scandal, celebrities headed to court today, actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman among a group of parent expected today before a judge. All could face harsh penalties including tax charges, IRS payments, even jail time.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Andrew Napolitano. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning. So, these are arraignments in federal district court in Boston which have been going on in groups. You know, there's so many people involved in this case that the court has been bringing them in periodically and many of them have nothing to do with Boston. Some of these people are in Los Angeles and they're presumably in Boston now.</p><p>So, an arraignment is relatively uneventful but it does because it's basically you understand the charges against you and do you understand what your bail is which has already been set. But it does remind us of the -- of the size and complexity of this entire thing.</p><p>It also reminds me that the federal government is not finished investigating because one of the ways that the parents can lessen their exposure is by reporting others that they know that have done this, either with the same people, the Rick Singer team, it's called on a team, because it's a criminal conspiracy, they've already pleaded guilty to it, or with others.</p><p>So, it's hard for me to say where this is going to go. The -- you know, the students have not been indicted. The schools have not been indicted. Some of the students have already been kicked out of the schools in which they -- to which they were admitted. I do suspect that a lot more will come out of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, you're saying if they rat, these parents rat on their friends.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I can't (INAUDIBLE) use that word. You know, look, here's a basic rule of thumb. Whoever goes to the prosecutor -- the 38 teams of parents here. Whoever goes to the prosecutors first is going to get the easier deal. And whoever brings the most information to the prosecutors is going to get the easier deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I do not believe that this is a jail time case for the parents. Some of them themselves were duped. It is clearly a jail time case for the people who were receiving the bribes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the trouble for these actresses, these famous people, these parents is that Rick Singer was cooperating with the prosecutors, with the FBI.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, that's how they all got caught.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. So, they don't really have as much to bring to the table. Like, if you can flip on the mastermind that you probably (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: OK, let me clarify what I was saying. One of the things Singer's lawyer said as he was walking out of the courthouse when he pleaded guilty was, my client helped over 750 people. What? There's only 50 families involved in this case. Where are the other 700? So, it would be flipping on people not in the case or on other conspiracies that the government might be interested in knowing about and doesn't know about.</p><p>BLOCK: Well, how far -- how far is the government into those other 700? Are they into 10 of them? Are they into zero of them? Are they into 700 of them?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, thus far, that's all below the radar screen and the government reveals these things when it wants to or when it has to, when it feels the defendant may be fleeing the jurisdiction. So, we don't know the answer.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And it might not be just this one case, right? There might be other rings, there might be other networks that are -- that are working.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, really?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that's exactly what they're looking for. They believe they have everybody in the Singer network but there probably are other people out there. You know, these are not organized like fine corporations. These are --</p><p>BLOCK: It's not a monopoly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. These are very loosely tied in together agreements. There may be an overlapping or there may not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about the Oscar antitrust concerns? Dagen reported on them on the top of the show. The Justice Department reportedly warning the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences about changing Oscar rules to exclude streaming services. It says that that could raise antitrust concerns. The warning is the response to reports of Steven Spielberg's proposed rule change that would prevent Netflix from competing at the Academy Awards. This comes as Netflix begins rolling out another round of price increases each package expected to jump by $1.00 or $2.00. And also after the nomination that happened by a Netflix -- of a Netflix film, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was \"Roma\" is the best picture nominee, Alfonso Cuaron. It was released in a very limited number of theaters. What the academy is trying to do is make Netflix and any streaming service release its films -- release its movies in more theaters to qualify because, again, I guess the people who make movies aren't authors like Steven Spielberg.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: In my view, this is a novel use of the antitrust laws. And I don't know where it's going to go. I mean, typically, the purpose of antitrust is to prevent one competitor from dominating the market or pushing another competitor. The economy doesn't compete with anybody. It's a voluntary group of people that basically just laud themselves. The competitors are the -- are the -- are the producers of the -- and the studios.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You're being polite when you say novel use. I mean, the idea that a big tech company like Netflix is a victim of dominance by some other groups --</p><p>BLOCK: It's absurd.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- seems a little far-fetched.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And you know what? This is from a conservative Republican, Department of Justice. I might have expected this three or four years ago from the folks that ran the Antitrust Division in the Obama years. But --</p><p>HILSENRATH: The way they're talking about using antitrust is not small government.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just love the dismissiveness of Spielberg, saying that the -- that the content created for Netflix, it's a T.V. movie if it's not released in a certain number of theaters. (INAUDIBLE) Again, it's the idiot bubble of holly weird.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, holly weird.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: To Jon's comment which is -- which is right on the mark, the best response for this would be for Netflix to kick the daylights out of these people with the way that they -- with their business model.</p><p>BLOCK: They're doing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, I think that's what's happening.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why they're upset.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Why should the government get involved?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right, what does the federal government care about this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Spielberg just is -- was at that Apple announcement about its content deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New content that it's releasing on the T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oprah was there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oprah. And so --</p><p>BLOCK: Well, Dagen, it's different, they're paying him. They're steering revenues to him. It's OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So, here's the basic rule of thumb. Any contract or combination and restraint of interstate trade is illegal. Netflix -- is Spielberg's reaction to Netflix restraining interstate trait or enhancing it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like I said -- like I said, the Irishman with ?Martin Scorsese, starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci is coming out this fall. Let's see if the Academy tries to eyes out more. What did you say to me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I say are you talking to me?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I am talking to you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: She's auditioning for a part in the movie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: that's going to be good. That's a good cast.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I make you laugh? You think I'm funny?</p><p>BLOCK: You're funny, Dagen.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: (INAUDIBLE) Virginia, I love you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Quick break and then Zillow is expanding its reach, we will tell you about the real estate website's new Home Loans division that could change the house buying market.</p><p>And then lounging at the Louvre, pack your bags, Airbnb is offering an overnight in the city of lights. All the details coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Verizon introduces a smartphone plan just for kids. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. Verizon hoping its new just for kids plan is going to position it as the go-to company for a child's first cell phone. Get them young. The plan includes five gigabytes of monthly data plus unlimited talk and text to 20 all contacts (INAUDIBLE) preapproved by the parents, we should say. There are no fees if the child goes beyond the allowed data. The phone will going to slow down though. Just Kids starts at $55.00 a month. Stock up as you can see about a quarter percent in the premarket.</p><p>Zillow expanding, the company launching a Home Loans division. This is going to allow buyers to shop for mortgages on Zillow. The company says the new division can simplify real estate transactions. They had 160 million average monthly users in the last quarter by the way.</p><p>And then there is this, Airbnb offering a very rare chance to spend a night with the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Guests get to sleep inside the giant class pyramid after a specially guided tour, drinks alongside Leonardo DiCaprio -- Leonardo da Vinci's (INAUDIBLE) No, that would not be Leonardo DiCaprio, Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting. A pop up fees in an intimate acoustic concert. If you're interested, go to Airbnb.com/louvre by April 12. And then you have to answer a question, why would you be the Mona Lisa's perfect guest? I thought about this, I've seen her twice now. I feel like she was judging me. So, I think -- I think I'm going to enter the contest.</p><p>BLOCK: What's not well known --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I saw her too. I love the Louvre. I took my mom and my sister there a couple of years ago. It was great.</p><p>CASONE: She's so and she's so small. Mona Lisa's small.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll tell you the best painting in the Louvre is Paolo Veronese's the Marriage at Cana. It's -- he's a Venetian Renaissance artist. Despite the fact that the French ripped a hole in it, they were years ago when they were repairing it, anyway, that's the go-to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's so beautiful.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'd be pretty impressed if your producers can call that up and get that on air in the next 30 seconds.</p><p>BLOCK: Well, Cheryl, what's not -- what's not well-known, is that Mona Lisa when she was being painted she actually said paint me like you paint your French girls, Leonardo, you know, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what she said.</p><p>CASONE: She's judging me. I don't know. I don't know what she knows but she knows something.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, changing lanes, one racing legend's new gig taking him to a vineyard. We've got the race car-inspired line of wines on-set, right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: From the racetrack to the vineyard, professional race car driver and team owner, Kevin Buckler changing lanes and his Adobe Road Winery in Petaluma, California. Adobe Road out with racing series wines, a collection of four red wines crafted to reflect Buckler's 30 year professional racing career.</p><p>We've got them here on set, as well as Kevin, joining us right now, professional race car driver, team owner, Adobe Road Winery founder, Kevin Buckler. Kevin, it's great to see you.</p><p>KEVIN BUCKLER, FOUNDER, ADOBE ROAD WINERY: Hi guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BUCKLER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, a real right turn or left turn into vineyards. Tell us why you made this decision and your love for wine.</p><p>BUCKLER: Absolutely. You know, we started early on, just trying to follow my passion with I had a nice little exit from an early --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry.</p><p>BUCKLER: -- had a little exit from an early business and able to follow my (INAUDIBLE) and said, if I ever worked that hard again, I wanted to do it on something I love, and it was cars and wine. And we worked really hard on the racing side, I had a great team, did some amazing things together. And then we wanted to take some of that same drive and passion and a little bit of fun.</p><p>You know, the wines, we have a great team back at the office and at the winery. They've been doing some really good stuff with Adobe Road with a regular brand. But we wanted to launch this racing inspired series around some really cool California blends. I love blend wines and as you can see, we had a little fun with the packaging technology as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you picked an industry that is just as hard to make money in.</p><p>BUCKLER: How did you know -- how did you know that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's just one of those like car racing and wine making.</p><p>BUCKLER: It's crazy. The top is dominated by you know, a lot of people that have no -- you know, not an interest in maybe a profit model and some do. And a little guy getting in his car how to break in.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even Richard Petty will tell you that. He's like, you're getting it because you love racing and you like making money.</p><p>BUCKLER: How do you -- how do you make a small fortune in racing, you start with a big one. That goes with the wine business too, that was the standard joke. Yes, we're having fun with it. The wines are great. I love that one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is shift, which is a mix of Zinfandel, Grenache, Petite Sirah and a couple others.</p><p>BUCKLER: (INAUDIBLE) That's got a fun blend, Grenache, Barbera. Things you would normally blend and we do a little bit of a double (INAUDIBLE). You know, if I'm talking about, I'm talking about making sure you're shifting perfect -- you know, perfectly at a high level. Garrett, my wine maker will say, well, this is a shift roast to a new type of blend that we want to try.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I love the bottles, each wine named after elements of car racing. So, this one with the latch on it. Well, tell us about this one.</p><p>BUCKLER: That one is a dream of mine. You know, the big endurance races, the 24 hour endurance races are extremely hard.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You won the Rolex, right?</p><p>BUCKLER: Won the Rolex. We won the Rolex four times. I won it twice as a driver. And then, the Le Mans 24 in 2002 as well. And it's all about the watch, you know, you want to get the watch. You know, you'd do anything for the watch. But that's a big deal for us. And so we had a little fun, a little homage to the team's success with that as well and a good blend.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So are you -- are you encouraging drivers to pour the wine all over themselves after they finish the races?</p><p>BUCKLER: No, that's a big some mess. You know, we like when the champagne comes after all these years, I see it coming, I run, because nobody wants - -</p><p>MCDOWELL: In NASCAR it's beer and Coca-Cola. I've been doused after Tony Stewart won the 2011 championship, I was covered in Coca-Cola after that. That was just nothing -- I will take -- I will take a bottle of red wine over my head over coke any day of the week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this the highest premium with the watch on it, with the Rolex on it?</p><p>BUCKLER: No, actually, the apex is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>BUCKLER: In the double (INAUDIBLE) for me, Apex is the perfect wine through a corner as a driver. But for a wine maker, it's the best of the best. It's a cabernet blend and it's delicious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it, the label.</p><p>HILSENRATH: How does this fit with the racing community's demographic? Dagen was talking about beer and coke. Is there like a higher end drinker --</p><p>BUCKLER: It's not really the racing community as much. You know, the car cultures behave right now or you go to any of the (INAUDIBLE), maybe not right here in the middle of New York that is out on any of the coast, there's always a cars and coffee going on, you know, there's a lot of sports car stuff. And sports car --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've got a Porsche in a garage down the road, so.</p><p>BUCKLER: There you go. Though we see it a -- we see a lot of the corporate entertainment that we do while we're taking guests to the track on the weekend as a private banking clients that would come out and have fun. It might be doing a golf tournament but then they go racing and they say oh, that was really cool. So, we got a lot of that going on as well. There's a lot of experience experiential stuff that we do. And we're all just like finishing up with a wine dinner at night or something like that. So, we've got to blend them up, have some fun.</p><p>BLOCK: How's business? How tough is it to build a young business in this country today?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good question.</p><p>BUCKLER: You know, the wine business is changing. And I feel like in a little bit -- I mean, we're just little guys in the wine world. But the paradigm is shifting a little bit about it.</p><p>You know, it used to be a big, a long trip for a tasting in Napa or Sonoma and now it's a lot of experiential. And if you have to blend like my little city at Petaluma, we're so proud to be there. If Austin, Texas and Napa Valley have a love trial, they'd be in Petaluma, California right there in the -- in the -- in the heart of the wine country and the first city as you cross across the building gate.</p><p>So, you know, we're having fun with it, we're building our new facility as well, it's been three years in the making. We break ground in June and looking forward to be in our -- putting our home right there in downtown Petaluma.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How fantastic. Kevin, great. Congratulations.</p><p>BUCKLER: Thank you, thanks guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be looking for you on the racetrack as well as the wine.</p><p>BUCKLER: I brought you all hot pick pass here for the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, you're great. Kevin Buckler. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019040302cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT4-FKC1-DXH2-64SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Rick Singer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oscars</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zillow</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Home Loans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Louvre Museum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Airbnb</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Netflix</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Steven Spielberg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Verizon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mona Lisa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, March 9th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Get your seatbelt on, we've got market mayhem underway on Wall Street. A global market selloff right now. Futures are trading limit down. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial average is down 1,255 points. Limit down prevents declines larger than 5 percent. So there are these circuit breakers in place to keep things calm and orderly. The declines could be a lot worse at the opening of trading, but right now we're looking at limit down with the Dow down 5 percent, Nasdaq down just under 5 percent, same with the S&amp;P 500 with a decline of 145 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trigger for this selloff this morning is the price of oil. Oil prices are plummeting because Saudi Arabia has launched a price war after Russia said it would not agree to any production cuts, which OPEC proposed last week. Oil is seeing its worst selloff since the start of the Gulf War in 1991. Oil prices down 23 percent, $31.74 a barrel is the last trade on oil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These kinds of numbers could cause defaults in the oil market and that is really what the worry is in terms of equities.</p><p>Yields on the Treasury also dipping below 0.4 percent earlier. Take a look at this. These yields are dropping like a rock. You've got the 10 year Treasury now at 0.456 percent. That is down 31 basis points. Even the 30 year is falling below 1 percent for the first time in history. This morning, the 30 year yield is at 0.870 percent. That's down 42 basis points.</p><p>The whole market nowhere to hide, but big banks are certainly under big pressure. Concerns are growing about the global economy. Investors are looking to the Federal Reserve for another rate cut. And there's a lot of speculation that the Congress could come up with fiscal stimulus as well because we are expecting a sharp slowdown in growth.</p><p>Global markets this morning, deep selloff in Europe. Take a look at the big banks there and the European indices and you see the same. The FT 100 in London is down 372 points, that's 5.75 percent, the CAC quarante in Paris is down 344 points, 6.5 percent, and the DAX index in Germany down 750 points, there too, 6.5 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, red across the board. China's exports came out. They tumbled 17.25 percent in January and February. More signs of trouble in Japan as well. Fourth quarter GDP there revised lower, showing that the economy in Japan contracted 7.1 percent from the previous quarter.</p><p>Of course the coronavirus crisis is also among the worries. The cases in the United States and abroad growing. The White House reportedly looking into emergency measures.</p><p>Meanwhile overseas, Italy is on lockdown. They reported a surge in deaths. They are looking -- they are locking down the northern region by closing borders in Italy. Dr. Oz is going to be here later on this hour with some important tips on staying healthy at home and when you travel. Don't miss this, because if you are planning on travel, you want to hear Dr. Oz's tips on that.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 2020 races continues to heat up. Tomorrow's a big day. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders security endorsements and trading sharp words ahead of the Michigan primary tomorrow.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>And markets the big story this morning, showing that the limit down has the markets down about almost 5 percent across the board. This on top of Friday's close where we actually saw worries throughout the market but it was volatile. And by the close on Friday, we actually ended off of the worst levels of the day.</p><p>Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, California preparing for a cruise ship to dock in Oakland, California with at least 21 passengers infected with coronavirus abroad -- aboard, rather, aboard that ship. The Grand Princess has more than 3,500 people on-board from 54 countries. Governor Gavin Newsom now working to ease concerns that any of them will be released into the population before a 14-day quarantine.</p><p>Republican lawmakers Ted Cruz and Paul Gosar are self-quarantining and missing key votes. The two say that they were feeling fine after contact with a person who did test positive for coronavirus at a recent political conference. Neither are said to be showing any symptoms this morning.</p><p>Italy locking down 16 million people in the northern part of the country. Officials at Disneyland Paris also checking on staff after one worker tested positive for coronavirus. The park remains open there. The coronavirus death toll is now topping 3,800 people with more than 109,000 cases reported worldwide affecting 98 countries.</p><p>We just spoke with the surgeon general. He said the risk of death increases for people above 80 and the risk of serious care in terms of getting sick risks above 60 years old.</p><p>As spring break approaches, Florida attractions are keeping an eye on the outbreak, of course. Disney World officials have released an action plan if a visitor is thought to have the virus. And they also plan on fumigating and disinfecting the park as often as possible.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence is stressing this weekend that it is still safe to travel in the United States. The vice president did, however, stress that seniors and those with underlying medical conditions are at most risk. They are saying avoid cruises. Last year the city of Orlando attracted 75 million visitors.</p><p>Happening overnight, North Korea launched at least three projectiles in its second weapons test in a week. These projectiles, believed to be ballistic missiles, flew for more than 120 miles before dropping in the Sea of Japan. The new launches come just two days after North Korea threatened, quote, momentous action against those who object to its military drills.</p><p>Oil, one of the leading stories of the markets today, certainly. Prices are plummeting amid a clash between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Saudis cut prices after no deal was reached between OPEC and non-OPEC countries on production cuts.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former president of Shell Oil, John Hofmeister.</p><p>And, John, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER PRESIDENT, SHELL OIL: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a serious selloff in many of the oil companies this morning as we watch oil prices plummet to the $33 a barrel level.</p><p>Tell us the implications of this, John, and how oil companies, perhaps with a lot of debt, may get impacted here.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Well, this is raw politics at its worst. A communist dictator not going to have terms dictated to him. A sovereign who is basically throwing his toys out of the pram because he's so upset. And both are pretty upset at the success of the U.S.</p><p>Now, the success of the U.S. has come at a cost because there are many smaller companies, highly leveraged, and they are counting on a much higher oil price for, you know, their loan repayments and their actual cash flow. And so this is going to be very tough on some companies, Maria, and they just need to button down.</p><p>But, you know, we've had -- we've been through this before. This industry is not for the faint of heart. People who understand this industry never go into a business plan without a low price scenario, as well as a high price scenario and then a hoped for price scenario.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: So, for the majors, I'm not worried because they've been through this. They know what to do. They know how to cut costs. They know how to rebound to this. They'll slow down their capital spend, et cetera.</p><p>For the smaller companies and particularly for the oilfield services who will feel the brunt of the cutback in capital spending, this is going to be a tough road to hoe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is -- the companies that you're talking about, this is exactly what countries like Russia wants to see. They want to see those -- those oil companies that have been leading the fracking revolution here to be financially broken. And that's what could happen if you've got all of these leveraged companies counting on a certain price of oil, now down to the 30 level.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: That's right. This is a direct attack, in my opinion, by Putin against the success of the American industry in the face of all the sanctions that he and his country have felt because of U.S. success. So this is enmity in its worst form.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: And he's not going to back off because he doesn't have to. And inflicting pain on his own people is not really his top priority or concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And this is what I said to the group during the commercial break, Scott, when I said, look, remember during the financial crisis when we heard reports of the Chinese and the Russians getting together where the leader of Russia said to the leader of China, now is the perfect time to start selling some of these securities that we own of the U.S., to pile on and create -- and make the situation even worse, and that's exactly what's playing here.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, to further the pain. And I think, you know, John, as you point out, there's a lot of let's just say -- a lot of scary tactics going on too I think with respect to what's happening with Russia. And, clearly, one thing you mentioned that I think is really a key point to take away is, the capital restructuring that could occur here, I mean Maria and I and Dagen and Kelly, you know, have been talking about some of the debt instruments that are out there in the oil side of things. They can restructure some of the balance sheets and some of the operations, cash operations too, John, going forward, if they do have to cut dividends to help service that debt, correct?</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Yes, they can, although I think dividends have been under pressure for quite a while, so it's not like there's a huge amount of flexibility. And we know the banks have really been getting hard over on the industry and so it's going to be a lean time and the strong will survive, the weak will probably go through a period of rationalization. I think we'll see fewer companies coming out the other end of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>In terms of help from the federal government, what could assist these companies in the short run? Deferred tax payments? Seems like it would take more than that.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Yes, I'm not sure the industry really wants any kind of a federal bailout. There may be individual companies that might like something. But the industry doesn't really -- from a reputation standpoint, doesn't lean towards any kind of governmental help. They know how to take care of themselves by and large. If it's offered, some may take it. But I think many would just say no thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting to look at Saudi Aramco. The stock is now below its IPO price. But pretty much Saudi Aramco was the one who cut prices to get back at Russia.</p><p>So here you have a company plummeting by its own decision making, John, because they say, oh, really, Russia, you're not going to go along with OPEC cuts, then we're going to cut prices.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Well, anyone that invested in Saudi Aramco should know that they did not invest into a free market. This -- anything that is controlled by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not a free market economy and it's going to be -- you're subject to manipulation. So getting the value back that people have surrendered over to the kingdom I think is going to be a real struggle, at least for the foreseeable future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you have concerns, John, about investing in credit in the energy space right here? I mean you were just talking about some of those drillers and those service companies that are relying on a certain price of oil that is way higher than we are right now. We could see defaults there. So what's the worry in terms of investing in credit -- or in energy?</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Well, you're going to have to be very selective and look for those companies that have a strong balance sheet, that have a history of adapting to low price -- the low price world of oil, because that's what we're into, at least for the foreseeable future, and until moods change or opinions change.</p><p>But, yes, I think you need to be very selective. Take good advice. Dig into people's books. You know, the recent Occidental deal is going to be problematic, I think, because it was predicated on a rising oil price, not a falling oil price. So Occidental and its disposal of assets, they've got a rough patch ahead of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we're looking at even the big oil companies get caught up in this, John. You were the former president of Shell Oil. You've seen lots of cycles, John, yourself. When you see Exxon Mobil down 11 percent, Chevron down 12 percent, do you see this as an overreaction?</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Yes, and I see it as a great buying opportunity for the patient investor who's in it for the long term. We went through a $10 debacle in the 1998, 1999 period and, you know, came out the other side, made a lot of money for investors over the next decade and a half. And it was really the sovereign nation of Saudi Arabia that took the industry down in 2014. And we haven't fully recovered because of the damage done by what I think is a very naive crown prince who really doesn't understand how the industry operates and his own sovereign fund in the kingdom has suffered mightily because of it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: And it still hasn't recovered to what it once was. So this is just bad management on the part of a monarchy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's great -- it's a great analysis.</p><p>John, it's wonderful to have you this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>HOFMEISTER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching.</p><p>John Hofmeister joining us. He's the former president of Shell Oil.</p><p>We're going to take a break and watch these markets. We've got a primary contest happening tomorrow.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we are going to look at Michigan, crucial Democratic primaries. Voters headed to the polls tomorrow in what's being called a mini Super Tuesday.</p><p>Plus, we've got facts on flying. Dr. Oz is here discussing how you can stay healthy while traveling in the face of coronavirus cases increasing.</p><p>Plus, inside Chick-Fil-A. A company heir joins me to talk about the recipe for success. Don't miss that.</p><p>And, of course, markets coming up right here. Dow Industrials down, limit down.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Bail reform triggers rising crime in New York City. The NYPD reporting a 20 percent increase over the first two months of the year compared to 2019.</p><p>I spoke with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" this weekend about this controversial issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bottom line, will you propose or support that judges have the discretion to let out criminals as they see fit and change this bail reform situation, which has caused crime numbers to go shooting up?</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Look, bail reform for many years was based on how much money you had, Maria. That's what cash bail is. If you're rich, you get out. If you're poor, you sit. That's an injustice, not justice. We made that change. We're going to make more changes. I understand the fear. I understand the criticism. I said that I'm working on it. And I believe we're going to get something done in the budget on April 1.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So he's making a promise here that they're going to make a change come April 1st.</p><p>Dagen, we've been talking about this now for over a year. Look at these numbers. Shootings up in the double digits. Felonies up in the double digits. I mean this is actually serious having an impact.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Look at these numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much more crime do New Yorkers have to tolerate. And as particular -- again, these are -- this is a New York City Police Department. But you've had a spike -- and this was in January as well -- in particularly things, crimes, that don't -- that you don't have to put up bail, that you don't go to -- you get written a ticket and you don't even go to jail. Robbery, a 35 percent increase. Burglary up 21 percent.</p><p>How much more of this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do the people of this state need to tolerate, because in one afternoon I was chased by two mentally ill people down a street in a residential neighborhood where one person threw -- one man threw a giant metal sign at me. And so it's not just me, it is people throughout this city.</p><p>You are not protecting the people of New York City and New York state and it's disgusting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, it's -- it's -- it is disgusting because this bail reform has allowed criminals back on the street. I mean there are stories of, you know, one guy who was arrested and then let out and then he went on to rob three more banks. You know, a punch in the nose is apparently non- violent.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes.</p><p>KELLY TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, \"THE NEW YORK POST\": Exactly. And I have to push back on Governor Cuomo there. It's not just about money. You know, he says, if you're poor, you stay in, if you're rich, you get out. No, when judges have discretion, they can keep people in who they think are violent and likely to commit more crimes. Well, that -- that's impossible, judges do not have that discretion. So it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, they can't do anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: And I also have to push back a bit. He's going to fix it with the budget? So for people who don't know, the budget is a process that's basically Cuomo, the leaders of the state assembly, the house and the senate, all Democrats, this is exactly how we got bail reform in the first place is this secret process that didn't go through regular legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Huh.</p><p>TORRANCE: It went through the budget. It should not have gone through the budget.</p><p>MARTIN: Regular proceeding. Yes, that's a good point. That's a little -- (INAUDIBLE). Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is such a good point. But He's putting that data out there as if that's going to be some kind of a resolution.</p><p>Look, we also talked about the issues that he's having with Homeland Security. New York, the only state that will not allow the feds to see the DMV data. We talked about the trusted traveler programs like Global Entry.</p><p>Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now a lot of New Yorkers are in jeopardy of losing their trusted travel programs like Global Entry.</p><p>Where are you on that, sir?</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): So we have undocumented drivers. DHS, Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol, wants access to our undocumented drivers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: I can't give them access.</p><p>They're holding the trusted traveler program hostage until -- because they want me to turn over to Customs and Border Patrol undocumented people. They're holding it hostage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>CUOMO: It's leverage. It's extortion. It's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CUOMO: So the federal government does have it, Maria, because the FBI has it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: He says the FBI has it and he says, look, to the DHS, go ask the FBI.</p><p>But, still, we've had Chad Wolf, the Department of Homeland Security secretary on this program and says that's the whole reason they want give us the access because they don't want to show who's illegal in New York.</p><p>TORRANCE: No, exactly, Maria. He -- again, misleading people, I think, right there, Maria. And I'm glad you, you know, called him on it.</p><p>No, the government needs to look at that data to -- with the global entry, to see, is this right, is this information correct? It's not that they're just holding back undocumented. They don't want to give them access to anything.</p><p>And let's keep in mind, combined with this bail reform, we have people that are undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, let back on the street. They won't let ICE come --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're putting illegal immigrants and criminals ahead of law abiding citizens, period.</p><p>MARTIN: And then they lose track of them. They lose track of those people too and don't know where they are.</p><p>TORRANCE: A 92-year-old woman was raped and murdered by someone that ICE should have taken and Cuomo wouldn't let them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>2020 showdown. Six states are set to hold primaries and caucuses tomorrow as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders each gain coveted endorsements. Just moments ago, Senator Cory Booker endorsed Joe Biden.</p><p>Todd Piro is here now with the very latest.</p><p>Todd, good morning to you.</p><p>TODD PIRO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria.</p><p>Another individual coming to the center there, Cory Booker. But an intense weekend of campaigning, trying to win votes in a handful of states, none more important than Michigan, with its 125 delegates up for grabs. Other states with contests include Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state.</p><p>Bernie Sanders laser focused on Michigan, appearing there with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and getting an endorsement from the Reverend Jesse Jackson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm feeling good about the momentum that we have. I think we're going to do well on Tuesday. And I think we're going to beat Biden.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": Beat Biden in Michigan?</p><p>SANDERS: Yes, I do. Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRO: Biden, fresh off his Super Tuesday success in the south, back at it there with a push in Mississippi over the weekend. Former VP getting key endorsements. We just mentioned Cory Booker. Over the weekend, former presidential candidate and current California Senator Kamala Harris, who went high hard after Biden in the debates, as you recall. Some pundits even predicting Harris as his VP if he gets the nomination.</p><p>But, despite his recent success at the ballot box, yet even more gaffes.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nominate a Democrat, a life-long Democrat. An Obiden Bama Democrat.</p><p>We cannot get re-elect -- we cannot win this re-election -- excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRO: Unclear if Biden's gaffes will come up when Bernie Sanders takes part in a Fox News town hall tonight in Detroit moderated by Bret Baier and Martha McCallum, 6:30 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>You know, we were talking about the endorsements off-air before. It seems that nobody's endorsing Bernie except for, you know, a few random people here and there and Biden's getting them all. It's going to be so curious to see what happens tomorrow and next Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's worth checking on how responsible the Democratic Party is to be rallying around Joe Biden right now given all of these -- I don't think you can call these gaffes anymore, by the way.</p><p>PIRO: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There is -- there is something seriously -- there's an issue here with Joe Biden. It's obvious. You know, we know that in the past he's had -- you know, he's talked about the brain aneurysm that he has, he actually has two. And I think, for the whole party to get behind him and say, yes, you know, go, I'm -- you know, he's the guy to beat Donald Trump, I think that -- it's worth saying, is this a responsible thing to do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and Bernie Sanders just had a heart attack, quite frankly.</p><p>PIRO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In the late fall. So -- and I'm about to make a joke so it's clear to everyone, but I look at both of these men and you think, as a country person, would I have either one of these gentlemen even mow the lawn in the middle of July for fear that they might faint in the yard. And the answer is, no. But this is what that party is left with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think that last clip that you played of Joe Biden is very serious when he was saying we have to re-elect Donald Trump. I mean, this is in the -- this is -- he keeps saying things that are wrong and yet the whole party -- he's -- that's -- he's their only hope, I guess.</p><p>PIRO: And to that earlier point, how organic are these endorsements? I mean are these individuals who say, I just feel this in my heart, I really want Joe, or is there something more happening behind the scenes --</p><p>MARTIN: It can't be. Yes.</p><p>PIRO: In light of these gaffes.</p><p>MARTIN: They have to.</p><p>PIRO: You know, trying -- trying to force the issue.</p><p>MARTIN: More important than ever about a good running mate nowadays, right, for those two candidates --</p><p>PIRO: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: Because, I mean, it's a clear sign that, you know, there could be some issues ahead if both those guys get in, one or the other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Does AOC want to be Bernie's vice president?</p><p>PIRO: Can't be because of the age situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PIRO: But, you know, this -- that Harris thing just makes so much sense if you're Joe Biden.</p><p>MARTIN: With Harris, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh.</p><p>PIRO: It makes absolute and total sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Todd, thank you.</p><p>PIRO: No problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Todd Piro there.</p><p>A quick break and then leaving jail. The Idaho mother of two missing children could be set free. A judge reducing Lori Vallow's bail. Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano will weigh in next.</p><p>And then Dr. Oz is here on flying safe. He's here discussing how to stay healthy while traveling amid the coronavirus outbreak. It's all coming up, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March 9th. Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We've got market mayhem underway, a global market sell off this morning. Right now, Futures trading at limit down preventing declines larger than five percent. Declines at the open could be even worse. The Dow Industrials right now down 1,255 points, all the averages down almost five percent right now.</p><p>It all started with the oil markets, oil prices are plummeting down 22 percent on the price of oil after Saudi Arabia launched a price war when Russia said that it would not agree to the production cuts proposed by OPEC last year -- last week, rather.</p><p>As a result, Russia's not going along with any production cuts. Saudi Arabia cuts prices. The price of oil down 22 percent in the global market.</p><p>Yields on treasuries are also plummeting. The 10-year Treasury dipped below four-tenths of a percent overnight and now you're looking at the yield on the 10-year at 0.418 percent, 35 percent -- 35 basis points lower on the 10-year.</p><p>The 30-year also falling below one percent for the first time in history. And as you can see, that yield right now at 0.853 percent, down 43 basis points.</p><p>A lot of the sectors that are trading down are closely tied to those markets. Airlines remain under pressure. There are reports that the White House could be offering relief to certain hard hit companies. And as you can see, the airline stocks are down across the board between four and six percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning also selling off. We have a deep self-off in Europe, the FT-100 down 416 points, the CAC Quarante down 353 points and the DAX index in Germany lower by 807 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was red across the board. China's exports tumbling 17-1/4 percent in January and February. More signs of trouble in Japan as well. The fourth quarter GDP was revised down showing its economy shrank 7.1 percent from the quarter before.</p><p>Meanwhile, rain on the West Coast Southern California bracing for heavy downpours today. Cheryl Casone with those details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. So a slow moving storm is going to bring rain there and that starts tonight. Parts of Southern California including Los Angeles and San Diego expected to pick up an inch of rain through Thursday.</p><p>This kind of is good news though, the state had its driest February in 126 years according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is your map.</p><p>Big tech is trying to save facial recognition as some states have banned government agencies from using the technology altogether. Companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM and Amazon have all called for precise regulations that don't allow mass surveillance instead of an outright ban. Facial recognition market could be worth guys, more than $14 billion by 2025.</p><p>And finally, things are looking way up for Disney and Pixar's \"Onward\". The animated film took the top spot at the weekend Box Office, earning an estimated $40 million here at home had also made 28 million overseas during its debut weekend.</p><p>Now, compared to other Pixar films, \"Onward\" actually fell short of expectations for the studio back in 2015. \"Inside Out\" opened to 98 million domestically.</p><p>But Maria, we've got to add here, this could certainly be related to the coronavirus. There are reports that a lot of movie theaters were pretty empty over the weekend. People just don't want to gather and confined spaces.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's the bottom line. And that's why you're seeing a serious impact on projected economic growth. Cheryl, thank you so much. That's happening across the board, conferences being closed as well.</p><p>The Idaho mother, meanwhile, whose two children have not been seen in months could leave jail as soon as today. A judge on Friday reduced Lori Vallow's bail from $5 million to $1 million, but also noted that Vallow so far has not indicated where her children are, despite a court order.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, why would bail be reduced this drastically? It was clearly set for that high for that reason, and we haven't seen these kids now in months.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: The only reason that I can think of is the bail includes electronic monitoring. And the government would like to be able to know her whereabouts to see if there's any effort to communicate with somebody who might know where the children are.</p><p>There's some sort of a religious or cultural cult involved with this family and some of the relatives of this woman are involved with the cult and some communication with the cult might tip off the police as to where the kids are. The kids haven't been seen since September, which is now seven months ago.</p><p>So look, the Idaho is a state -- unlike New York, we're talking about your very interesting and very telling interview with Governor Cuomo. Idaho's a state with a judge of absolute free reign. This judge could set the bail at zero or at five million.</p><p>Now, a $1 million bail normally means either a 100,000 in cash, or a 100,000 in property. I don't think she'll have much difficulty making that and I can easily predict that she'll be out sometime today.</p><p>MARTIN: Judge, you mentioned the communication with the cults. Now with Ms. Vallow and some of that communication that she supposedly had, with everything's so electronic these days, why hasn't the judicial system figured out what she's been communicating with the cult on as with respect to the kids and so forth?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's a great question. Scott, it's hard for me to believe that she is not under some kind of electronic surveillance already.</p><p>I mean, there is clearly probable cause of crime here. She -- her children are missing. There's at minimum child abuse, there's possibly desertion and abandonment, and there may be some sort of aggressive harm like murder. We don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's with all these smiles in court? I mean, she's smiling, she's laughing in court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: She either doesn't perceive the gravity of this or sometimes lawyers will say to defendants look happy, look relaxed, because you really didn't do anything wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how are you relaxed if your kids are missing for months?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I fully agree with you. So, it's an act of some sort that she's putting on which is getting under the skin of people that are observing it.</p><p>Sometimes judges would say, what the heck are you smirking about, this is definitely serious?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Other times judges will say, I don't really care about the look on your face. My job is to do justice in this courtroom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. It's great to see you, Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Thank you. You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Judge Napolitano.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, facts on flying safe. Dr. Oz is here next talking travel amid coronavirus fears.</p><p>Then, building Chick-fil-A, the heir to the fast food empire joins me, one of the heir. She's sharing her recipe to the family's success. We're back right after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus spreading turbulence across the airline industry. Health officials now telling high risk travelers to stay home. Industry trade groups are predicting losses in excess of $100 billion this year.</p><p>Joining us right now with facts for air travelers and ways to stay healthy during this outbreak, the vice chair of surgery at Columbia University and the host of \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\", Dr. Mehmet Oz is here. Great to see you Dr. Oz, thanks for being here.</p><p>So you must be really busy with all of this. Take us through the facts starting with air quality and seat location in terms of the most important things we need to know if you still need to travel in the face of all of this.</p><p>OZ: I'll give you those that a bit, but let me give you kind of a pep talk, we're a can do people. I want them to stay calm, don't panic, that's not really about what our goal is here. Our goal is to give you action steps you can take right now to keep yourself safe, more importantly keep people who are frail in the population in optimal conditions so they don't get ill. If you build a firewall with this virus, we'll do well.</p><p>So here are the actual steps. First of travel, if you're going to travel on a plane, please stay by the isle. I'd rather not by the isle, by the window it's some -- it's further away from all the crowds. The germ zone is a -- is a row in front of you and behind you. Take the air nozzle, blast it at your face. The air from outside the plane and that's been purified within the plane is 99.9 percent pure. So it's going to be the safest area you're going to be able to breathe. I just mentioned the emblematic of what you could do. You can wash your hands for example.</p><p>And by the way, when I say wash your hands for 20 seconds and wash your fingers in particular. Don't worry about your wrist; they don't make much of a difference. Don't shake hands obviously as we did not shake hands walking in here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We did the elbow bump.</p><p>OZ: And you need to because although historically, it shows your hand was free of a weapon and you weren't going to hurt somebody. These days you're actually carrying the weapon they can't see and you're going to infect them.</p><p>And hygiene is also critical in the area. This surface in front of me, the reasons coronavirus worries us is a germ on this virus from the guest before me could infect me. In fact, from a guest on Friday could have infected me because it lives on this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that will live on this desk for how many hours?</p><p>OZ: We believe for up to nine days.</p><p>MARTIN: Wow.</p><p>OZ: So it's really difficult to predict who was there so you got to clean it up. I like to spray the solutions on and once it dries it kills off the germs. It's even better than the wipes. Simple tactics like that are incredibly effective.</p><p>There have been supplements you can take that we believe might be beneficial in shortening duration, because many people won't even know they're sick when they get the virus. 80 percent of the symptoms of the people who get it are symptoms that are pretty mild.</p><p>So vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, elderberry. These are simple ideas, beta- glucan, which is from mushrooms --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what I've been doing every day is taking the Emergen-C drink. You know the packets, it's just vitamin C.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this. So before you leave, disinfect your surface.</p><p>OZ: Thank you very much. But the one thing about the wipes is you do have to let the surface get wet. If you just wipe like this, you're actually spreading germs.</p><p>So you want to leave the surface moist enough that as it dries up, you actually murder off all the virus particles that are in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it brings up mass transit. I mean, commuters on buses and trains. I mean, we don't know that those surfaces have been cleaned.</p><p>OZ: Well first, so you got to get in the (INAUDIBLE), arm length distance from the people around you. That's why prone to who are older and frail with chronic illnesses, they're the ones that we worry about. They have to be thoughtful about using mass transportation during rush hour, because you're being puzzled and bustled, you're touching too many people.</p><p>I agree holding those handles above your head is a catastrophe. So walk around with Kleenex in your hands to hold that or just during the commute wear gloves, then toss the gloves.</p><p>But what contaminates you is when your fingers touch that surface that's been able to harbor virus for days and days and days. Then you touch your face which you do a thousand times or more a day on average? Well, then you're taking virus and inoculating yourself with it, which is why this is so contagious.</p><p>I'll give you some numbers on this attritional flu. And this is really the only thing that's worse than to me about this. If I have the flu, the chance of me giving it to a person is meaningful, right? Nine people will get infected for me during that week.</p><p>But if I have coronavirus, it's 45 people get infected that week. It's so much greater in its contagiousness that if you happen to have a weakness for the virus, it'll catch up to you without you realizing it.</p><p>TORRANCE: But most people it sounds like don't have to worry, it is the elderly. You know, what does the average person really need to panic? I don't -- it doesn't sound like it.</p><p>OZ: I don't think -- again, it's not about not panicking -- you're not going to die from this virus, overwhelmingly you're safe.</p><p>However, you should do smart things to avoid you pass and give the people who are frail.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that's what I've been thinking about because my father is 83 years of age and he lives in the South and I was going to go visit him. I don't have any way to know if I have to -- I feel fine. But I could have it.</p><p>Potentially living in New York City, the most populous city in the nation, so I can't visit him until I could get tested, actually.</p><p>OZ: Testing is so far from being done for the average person, I wouldn't bother. But your dad should do basic things. Two weeks supply of the key things including over-the-counter medications, right, that's what you really need and prescription medications. Communicate using telephonic sources.</p><p>But you going down to visit him without knowing for sure that you don't have the illness and again, people sometimes are so suddenly infected, they don't have symptoms, and you're putting him at risk for no good reason.</p><p>I'm going to say this again, if you're --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you agree, she shouldn't visit her father? My dad is 87 and I was thinking the same thing but I wasn't going to not visit him for this.</p><p>OZ: I would spend a couple weeks until we really understand what's going on with this -- with the -- with people who are infected in this country because it's different than those infected in Wuhan. And most of our data is coming from the Chinese CDC.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>OZ: So if I give you mortality numbers, they're based only on people living in Wuhan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we know what's coming at us, we know that the numbers are about to spike. Let's talk about being ready for it and staying healthy ahead of it because you have some tips and suggestions to stay healthy as this comes and one of them is getting a humidifier?</p><p>OZ: The virus doesn't like humidity and it doesn't like warmth. So if you have a room that is warmer than the outside temperature and you use a humidifier to keep the moisture and for two reasons, it pushes back the virus but it keeps your mucous membranes moist as well. So (INAUDIBLE) cracks, that's how the viruses get into us.</p><p>Part of the problem with air travel is it's dry up there. And so your mucous membranes dry up basically so they can protect you from virus particles in the air, so a humidifier makes perfect sense, why not?</p><p>And you only got a month more of cold weather after that you can put it away, retire it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is what Dr. Carson said the other day when he came on the show yesterday. He said, look, in the future, when we're retrofitting new buildings, when we're talking about cruise ships, it's going to be totally different, because you need the ventilation that will take certain particles out of the air. These cruise ships don't have that right now.</p><p>OZ: They don't use that technology. Why would they have been expected to do that? The planes do have technology like them interestingly. That's why the plain air that's re-circulated from the outside is actually pretty clean. But that's going to become the standard for buildings, it's going to be standard for ships. It's going to become how we manage ourselves going forward.</p><p>And I'm going to point this out, we are the firewall. The folks at this table are going to do fine if we get the virus. One of you may already have had the virus, not even knowing it, right?</p><p>There are folks who are panicked about the stock market who are working in the stock broke who may have already been infected. And yet they don't know that, so they're panicking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it just ran through their bodies and they didn't even know it?</p><p>OZ: Yes, 80 percent of the symptoms are small. But here, the symptoms are fever, it doesn't have to be high. Fatigue, you're going to feel like you have a dry cough.</p><p>And interestingly about 40 percent of people have diarrhea type symptoms, nausea, vomiting, things like that. Those are the symptoms you want to watch out for.</p><p>But again, they could be -- you may thought you are hangover, you may think you have allergies, you may just think you have a mild sunburn or head cold for the -- for the day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that will stay in your body for how long?</p><p>OZ: Well, with the virus seems to have an incubation period of anywhere from a week to two weeks. That's part of the problem because you can be contagious and not realize it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And not know it, yes.</p><p>OZ: But I would -- after that I would definitely quarantine myself for at least 10 days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So one bit of good news here is that children so far seem to be less affected than adults, which isn't the case with the seasonal flu, right? I mean, I don't know if they're carriers, they may very well be carriers. But kids under nine or 10 are not getting this.</p><p>OZ: Well, almost for sure they're carriers. However, there has not been a known death of a child under age 10.</p><p>I'll give you the numbers real quick. Under 10, zero. From 10 to 50, it's about up two in a thousand chance of dying, which is twice the seasonal flu, not a big difference. Above 50 starts going up (INAUDIBLE) in the Chinese CDC data.</p><p>One percent of people in the 50s will die. Four percent of people in their 60s, you double it every decade after that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>OZ: So, eight percent in the 70s, 15 percent in the 80s. So by the time we get to in the 80s and two people here that might have a parents in 80s as well with chronic illnesses, that's the group we want to worry about. Everyone else, just carry on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you on \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\".</p><p>OZ: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An American fast food icon, the heart and soul of Chick-fil-A is the subject of a new book written by my next guest A Quiet Strength: The Life and Legacy of Jeannette M. Cathy illustrates the behind the scenes impact of one of the chains founders.</p><p>Joining us right now is the daughter of Chick-fil-A founders S. Truett Cathy and Chick-fil-A company Ambassador Trudy Cathy White. Trudy, it's good to have you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>TRUDY CATHY WHITE, COMPANY AMBASSADOR, CHICK-FIL-A: Oh, thank you. It's an honor to be here with you today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What an incredible success story Chick-fil-A is and it's in your family and you've seen it from the beginning. Tell us about that.</p><p>WHITE: Yes, well, you know, I realized that a lot of people know my dad Truett Cathy is the founder of Chick-fil-A, but very few people have heard my mom's story. She was a remarkable lady. She really significantly impacted my dad's life, our family's life and the business.</p><p>So I put this book out A Quiet Strength just to help people know that behind everything is always something that is unseen. And she has been the unsung hero in our family, for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How wonderful. So what was it that created such success? Tell us if you can pinpoint one or two things where you believe this is what did it?</p><p>WHITE: Sure. Well, I believe that we've always tried to honor God through our -- through our business. We feel like biblical principles are what guides us in our business practices every day. And so that is really where we claim our success is being able to honor God through everything that we have been given. We feel like we're stewards of the things that God has entrusted to us.</p><p>MARTIN: One thing I was going to ask is -- you know, when you go to Chick- fil-A and then you go to other fast food chains, it's the food tastes different. It tastes better, it tastes fresher, more pure -- you know, it just tastes better. What's behind that, just better ingredients, better preparation? I mean, it seems like a secret because a lot of these other fast food chains don't have that deliverable.</p><p>WHITE: Yes, well, it certainly called the food but I think part of it may just be the service. We have people that enjoy serving others and we are so appreciative to our local operators and our team members that genuinely say it is my pleasure to serve you.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: Well, that's the thing I've noticed is you go into a Chick-fil-A and everyone's smiling, you know, and it really isn't -- it's not maybe not (INAUDIBLE) but infectious.</p><p>You know, you go in there you're having a good time and I think that does kind of -- it's a whole experience. It's not just this is a great chicken sandwich, which of course it is.</p><p>WHITE: Yes, most definitely, a lot of people come and eat with us are not even hungry, they're just looking for a great experience like you're talking about for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We can't let you go without asking you about these chicken sandwich wars especially between Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. What do you expects going to happen here?</p><p>WHITE: You know, we're just going to stay focused on what we're trying to do. We're going to try to serve a great sandwich in a -- in a wonderful, clean experience and offer that for our customers and stay true to who we are. It's one thing my mother used to remind us. Every time we walk out the door, she'd say, remember who you are, and who's yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>WHITE: So, that's going to be important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you. Great book, Trudy Cathy, thank you so much.</p><p>WHITE: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Trudy Cathy White joining us. Back in a minute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020030902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCV-BMJ1-DXH2-6336-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 9, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Esa es la evaluaci\u00f3n que hace hoy Richard Waters en el Financial Times.    Las acusaciones fueron muchas y muy duras. Se escuch\u00f3 que la web abierta que todos conocimos est\u00e1 desapareciendo. A Jeff Bezos lo acusaron de aprovecharse de minoristas que dependen de su plataforma para vender. A Mark Zuckerberg de comprar a posibles competidores para neutralizarlos.    Pero si esas son todas las pruebas condenatorias que los congresistas extrajeron de los millones de documentos que analizaron, los cuatro CEO no tienen mucho que temer, opina Waters.    La situaci\u00f3n queda ahora m\u00e1s o menos como estaba antes de la audiencia: crece la regulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y regulatoria para que las tecnol\u00f3gicas adopten medidas correctivas pero la base legal para cuestionar seriamente el dominio de Big Tech sigue siendo d\u00e9bil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNES-42732567656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-CNF1-F07F-83XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Mercado Digital</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Spanish</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>31 Julio 2020 Viernes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Argentina</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>Espionage</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0008ZHS</classCode><className>Information Management + Technology</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>Telecommunications</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""
