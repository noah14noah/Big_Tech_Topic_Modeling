But, what does this mean for Government control on the internet.   Before it was banned by India, TikTok was one of the fastest growing social sharing apps in the world. Allowing its users to create and share 15 second videos, the platform became a teen favourite across the world. In India, the regular users of TikTok go beyond teens. We have all been regaled with grandmothers in saris dancing to classic movie numbers in the middle of the great Indian outdoors, in addition to other manifestations of talent from across the nation. However, the platform has also been used for other not so benign activities. As late as last month, there were discussions in parliament on the use of TikTok to spread fake news and \u2018malicious\u2019 content.   Even before the border clash with China that left fatalities on both sides, there had been calls to severely regulate TikTok, if not outright ban it. The main reason being, as per Chinese law, all social media platforms are bound to share data with the Chinese government, and this could have major implications not just for individual privacy, but also for national security. When India banned TikTok and 58 other apps on grounds that the activities that they indulged in were \u201cprejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\u201d it also accused these apps of \u201cstealing and surreptitiously transmitting users\u2019 data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India. The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures.\u201d   The Trump administration in the USA, which has had a pugilistic relationship with China so far, is mulling a similar course of action. For Trump, China represents a form of capitalism aimed at beggaring the USA. He has always believed that the Chinese Government has consistently bent the rules to make Chinese products more competitive in the international market, and it is this that has had an impact on American jobs. Mr Trump, not the most rational of all leaders, has had a bee in his bonnet about China from before he became President. He has been systematically imposing sanctions on Chinese imports to the USA, and his actions and the Chinese reactions have almost led the world to a trade war. After a series of reports that suggested that American sanctions against China have hurt the Americans more than the Chinese, there was some respite to the standoff, but it seems now that Mr Trump has Chinese app economy in his cross hairs\u2014with both TikTok and WeChat in the line of fire.   Last week, a Trump executive order stated that all transactions with these platforms need to cease within the next 45 days. In the order he noted that the platform\u2019s data collection allows the Chinese Communist party to access the personal and proprietary information of Americans\u2014including government employees, posing a danger to the country. He further accused the platform of censoring content that may be against the Communist Government in Beijing. Interestingly, the American President\u2019s order also said that the ban, that will come into effect in 45 days, will be against any transactions with Byte Dance, the parent company of TikTok. And, this means that to be considered \u2018safe\u2019 again TikTok needs to be sold, preferably to an American corporation. Right now, a host of companies ranging from Microsoft to Twitter are all talking to Byte Dance to see if they can buy TikTok and allow it to operate.   There are two issues here, both equally important. The first is that of large organisations\u2014including Governments\u2014to have granular access to our data, and help make predictions about the way we behave, or trigger us to behave in a particular way. And this is a worrying concern that many privacy activists have raised over the last few years. The second is the ability of the United States to order the stripping of the ownership of a company from one entity and ensuring its sale to another. This is the kind of behaviour that Imperial masters used to indulge in\u2014strip assets from local powers, and hand them over to their own people. The forced sale of TikTok definitely feels like a hark back to a past where western powers would call the shots.   While there are grave issues of the way data can be misused by the Chinese Government, this is a problem that exists with every government, or corporation, that may have control on your data. Banning TikTok, as India has done is a suitable response to that kind of a threat. However, the forced sale of a popular app from a Chinese company to an American company has grave implications not just for big tech, but all companies. National security is a term that covers a multitude of sins. Be it steel manufacturing, or telecommunications, pharmaceutical research and development, or food industries\u2014all of them impact national security. Are companies going to be threatened with sale, if their government does not see eye to eye with the American government? And, while the Chinese Government may have ruffled a bunch of feathers, what has happened to TikTok\u2014could happen to any corporation. And, this does not augur well for international trade.

At the same time, both newspapers and commercial broadcasters have seen a dramatic drop in advertising, just when the public's thirst for reliable news has never been greater.

The launch of BritBox illustrates how the BBC and ITV can work together in both their own commercial and national interest.</p><p>It is a pity that Project Kangaroo, a previous attempt to launch a UK competitor to Netflix more than a decade ago, was blocked on competition grounds.

Shouldn't we, as \"good conservatives,\" just step aside and wait for the market to self-correct?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This framing, however, ignores the wide-ranging and distorting impacts Big Tech has, not just on the market economy\u2014particularly on small business\u2014but on speech, behavior, elections and individual privacy. These are all things conservatives care about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In today's economy and culture, everything is tech. Nearly every business\u2014even the low-tech ones\u2014must now have a website and offer online ordering. To be remotely competitive, they must have database management and spend considerable sums on digital advertising. And to reach consumers where they are, this means doing business with Google and Facebook. Of the $88 billion spent on digital advertising in 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/technology/google-facebook-dominance-hurts-ad-tech-firms-speeding-consolidation.html\">over 90 percent</url> of it went to these two companies alone.</p><p>Simply \"opting out\" is no longer an option if you're a business trying to reach consumers in the digital space\u2014particularly as <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/17/why-googles-new-limits-on-third-party-cookies-are-another-attempt-to-control-the-web/\">Google bans ad competitors</url> from its search platform, Chrome, and independent ad tech firms are rapidly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketingtechnews.net/news/2018/aug/14/facebook-google-duopoly-means-ad-tech-growth-drying-fast/\">going out of business</url>.

It has also set itself up as a bottleneck, middleman and toll collector for huge swaths of the economy. But it's not just about business. The power of these corporations over our private lives is unprecedented.</p><p>Private companies now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations\">track our locations</url> while denying they do.

A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753\">deep investigation</url> into Google by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis> demonstrated not only that the search algorithm was, on at least one occasion, tweaked to favor big businesses, but that certain search term results were suppressed for searches on \"abortion\" and immigration.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\">Ninety percent</url> of the world's population uses Google, which magnifies the political and economic consequences of its corporate decisions\u2014particularly when the company misleads users about the autonomous nature of the information it presents.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, recently acknowledged its digital power over elections in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055348/facebook-trump-election-2020-leaked-memo-bosworth\">leaked internal memo</url>. \"So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?\" asked Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth. \"I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. ...He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser.\" Bosworth went on to note that the company has \"the tools available to us to change the outcome,\" but urges the company to \"never do that.\"</p><p>There is, obviously, nothing inherently wrong with a campaign successfully utilizing digital ad tools. But it's a stunning admission of power from a single company and a chilling reminder of how much control a single, private actor wields over access to political speech\u2014enough, apparently, to swing an election.</p><p>The control massive private companies have over political speech is currently very much on display, as Twitter is repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/tech/twitter-trump-fact-check/index.html\">fact-checking</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/29/trump-minneapolis-twitter-protest/\">limiting from view</url> tweets from both President Donald Trump and the White House. Snapchat has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/tech/snapchat-trump/index.html\">announced</url> it will do the same.</p><p>All of this, then, is far less a conversation about \"regulation\" than it is a very necessary acknowledgement of the incredible amounts of power wielded over our speech, elections, privacy, behavior and markets by a handful of private companies\u2014and if that requires more of an awareness from lawmakers, if not a public policy response. Yes, even conservative policy responses.</p><p>Google is currently under antitrust investigation for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-edged-out-rivals-and-built-the-worlds-dominant-ad-machine-a-visual-guide-11573142071\">bundling services</url> in the digital ad market by 50 state and territory attorneys general, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress. Congress is examining allegations that companies like Amazon and Google crush small competitors by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/17/companies-burned-by-big-tech-plead-congress-regulate-apple-amazon-facebook-google/\">stealing their intellectual property</url>.</p><p>Though some have criticized an antitrust remedy as perhaps unfairly singling out tech companies, antitrust investigators and congressional scrutiny are focused on specific acts\u2014not the targeting of specific companies without cause or merely because they are large. One need look no further than the overwhelmingly bipartisan <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00060\">vote</url> in 2018 to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for the first time. That legislation passed in the Senate by a 97 to two majority.</p><p>While some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet\">disagree</url> about the law's efficacy, the vote represented a sincere effort on the part of the Senate to protect children from online sex trafficking. It was never about singling out tech companies, per se. To suggest otherwise is disingenuous.</p><p>As Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ys4AxYoS9E&amp;t=11s\">put it</url>, \"big is not bad,\" and companies should not be singled out solely because they are successful. Rather, conservatives care about the equality of the marketplace and keeping small businesses competitive. It is incumbent upon them to ensure this is happening.</p><p>Mr. Chilson, my <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> \"Debate\" sparring partner, has in the past suggested that market inputs will solve perceived ills. But there can be no market inputs if the market is itself distorted. I agree with Mr. Chilson that innovation is vital to the American economy and must be fiercely protected\u2014which is why it is critical to ensure that innovation in one sector is not being suppressed by a handful of companies.</p><p>In other words, antitrust enforcers and Mr. Chilson share the same goal: both want to protect and foster innovation, and both recognize innovation as an important economic driver. However, antitrust enforcers rightly identify small businesses, and not monopoly platforms, as the sparks that light that engine.</p><p>The power of Big Tech over our markets, culture and politics has been growing slowly, in a way that many of us have accommodated as a necessary infiltration. But the scope of that power, and its costs to the society we have ordered, are increasingly becoming plain.</p><p>As William F. Buckley famously stated, \"I will not willingly cede more power to anyone, not to the state, not to General Motors. ...I will hoard my power like a miser, resisting every effort to drain it away from me.\" How much or how little power we as individual citizens will retain, as Big Tech grows, is one of the most important questions of our present moment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rachel Bovard is senior advisor to the Internet Accountability Project.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1599164/facebook-headquarters-california.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook headquarters in California</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook headquarters in California</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1510343</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6040-W8F1-DY68-10MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1246\"/><timeReceived>5:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2020 Newsweek Inc.

In 2015, Google disclosed that one in twenty search queries were health-related, and announced that it would be working with doctors to make sure that reliable information appeared high up in results. Such safeguarding appears to have been absent when it came to advertising.</p><p>As we report today, advertisements for supplements targeted at those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia have been allowed to appear at the top of results shown to people searching for those conditions, despite the supplements having no proven benefits. They include a \u00a338 per month product that promises to \"promote memory\" via ingredients such as avocado, and a drink costing \u00a33.50 per day that a clinical trial has shown is ineffective at tackling dementia.</p><p>As many as 850,000 British people suffer from forms of dementia and many of them are, by definition, vulnerable. None of these products themselves claims directly to be able to work miracles, and most would be breaking the law if they did. Some even explicitly say on their packaging that they are not intended to treat or prevent disease.</p><p>Yet sellers benefit by buying from Google the right to appear when queries about pills or supplements for Alzheimer's or dementia are typed into the search box. The dishonesty is invisible. Paid-for searches fall under the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, but a regulator cannot police what it cannot see.</p><p>Since </p><p>                   The Times                    </p><p>approached Google for comment, these advertisements have been removed. Yet it is not the job of traditional media to police far wealthier technology giants. Last month the Cairncross Review, which studied threats to high-quality journalism, warned that the domination of digital advertising by companies such as Facebook and Google threatened local and national newspapers. Between them, the two companies took 54 per cent of British digital advertising in 2017.</p><p>The Furman Review, commissioned last year by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, from a panel led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman, predicts that big tech's dominance of online advertising will only increase.</p><p>Short of these companies being broken up, as suggested both by Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, and by News UK, the owner of </p><p>                   The Times                   </p><p>, this seems inevitable. Being less opaque, traditional advertising could never permit such exploitative mendacity.</p><p>Online advertising, and the data targeting that facilitates it, is the cash cow that has seen companies such as Facebook and Google swell to become giants, absorbing or crushing a huge array of potential rivals. Data is harvested from users in ways that few understand, and then weaponised back at them. Both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner have warned of the impact of such practices when deployed in relatively unregulated political advertising.</p><p>The targeting of dubious pseudomedical products at vulnerable people is a facet of the same problem. Once again, new technology appears to be leading us into an ungoverned and potentially ungovernable Wild West, from which some of the richest companies in the world profit enormously while disavowing themselves of any responsibility. Once more, the need for new, effective regulation for these companies could not be more clear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52695224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR3-TMP1-F021-6546-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) announcement on Tuesday that it was fining Facebook $5 billion for mishandling users' data is only the latest in a series of regulatory actions against big tech.</p><p>The shift towards greater accountability is welcome. Technology companies have come to wield power akin to that of a state. They have huge amounts of information, much of it personal and sensitive, about their users. It is probably easier to keep an extramarital affair secret from a spouse than from a smartphone. Armed with that data, the companies know the users better than they know themselves, and so can sustain their attention and attract their clicks. They have power, too, over what they see, think and feel. President Trump railed last month that Twitter was \"biased toward Democrats\", complaining that if he were a liberal he would \"pick up five times more followers\". Twitter denies any such skew, but it is true that such platforms could easily tilt the playing field in favour of certain politicians.</p><p>Governments are therefore starting to bare their regulatory teeth. They have three main challenges. The first is to make sure that technology companies keep a close eye on users' data. The FTC has landed Facebook with the largest fine in the regulator's history for exposing millions of users' data to the political analytics company Cambridge Analytica. That followed a similar investigation by the information commissioner in this country. Mr Zuckerberg complained that Facebook would need to invest \"a significant amount\" in new tools to adhere to the settlement Facebook reached with the commission. That shows that the regulation is working.</p><p>The second challenge is to keep the market competitive. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, is the b\u00eate noire of Silicon Valley, having fined Google a total of (EURO)8.2 billion in antitrust investigations, lambasting the company for blocking its competitors from placing advertisements on other sites. Although Mr Trump has often sided with America's tech sector, complaining that EU competition investigations are acts of economic aggression, his own agencies are now following suit. The Department of Justice has announced that it is investigating Google and Apple, while the FTC looks at Facebook and Amazon. Britain's competition watchdog has launched a vital inquiry into the digital advertising market here too.</p><p>The third and most contentious challenge is policing the material that ends up online. Ursula von der Leyen, president-elect of the European Commission, has announced that she will propose laws that would force online platforms to remove some types of content. Britain has its own plans for a crackdown on \"online harms\" which, though ambitious, are startlingly vague. They range over everything from child sex abuse images and terrorist recruitment to cyberbullying and the manipulation of public opinion. Much of what the government wants to regulate is legal and the plans would give the regulator draconian powers to control what goes online. The edges will need to be rounded off. Nicky Morgan, the new culture secretary, has got her work cut out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-54775825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN9-RRH1-JCJY-G54S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, took an important step in that direction yesterday by demanding a review of the competition-distorting behaviour of the tech giants. The call to arms included tighter controls on online advertising revenue and tax dodging schemes as well as the protection of the public from online harassment.</p><p>The chancellor commissioned a report last year from a panel of economists, led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman. \"There are a lot of benefits to the digital sector,\" says Mr Furman, \"but when you have these large companies that are so dominant in so many markets, consumers do not have the choices they should have.\" If his conclusions are adopted, some blatant monopolistic practices of the tech giants could be open to robust challenge. They include a code of conduct to be policed by an independent regulator.</p><p>The digital economy has been at the heart of an extraordinary transformation of society, providing services and products at low prices. The cost of starting and scaling up a business has been cut with the help of cloud computing and digital comparison tools. Yet this is due overwhelmingly to the US giants that have squeezed the oxygen out of smaller start-ups. When growth threatens to slow, the whale swallows the minnows. Over the past decade the big five, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, have swallowed more than 400 companies that could have been rivals.</p><p>The report is an answer to a steady drumbeat of discontent. One is big tech's refusal to accept that they are publishers and curate their content. Young users, in particular, are vulnerable to unfiltered online abuse. It took years of pressure before Instagram banned graphic images of self-harm. Furthermore the tax paid by these companies is often derisory. There is a growing sense among users that their privacy is not adequately respected and that complaints are brushed off.</p><p>Last month the Cairncross Review, which investigated threats to high-quality journalism in Britain, warned that the domination of digital advertising by Google and Facebook was making it difficult for publishers and newspapers to survive. Out of a British digital advertising spend of \u00a311.55 billion in 2017, Google and Facebook took 54 per cent. The Furman Review takes up the issue. Google, it suggests, will tighten its grip on advertising as technology becomes more sophisticated. Not only publishers but consumers and advertisers will lose out to the Google business model.</p><p>Voices, including News Corp, owner of The Times, are calling for the break-up of Google, saying that its dominance \"strikes at the heart of our system of democracy\". Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential runner, has also called for the dismantling of the tech giants. The Furman report stops short of this, saying that it would make the business environment \"more uncertain and particularly risky\". Yet a consensus is emerging that tighter regulation is needed even though no one is quite sure how to get there. The chancellor, too, may come to the conclusion that these giants are too big, too predatory and willing to destroy too many public-interest publishers. If so, curbing them, or indeed breaking them up, may be the best solution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52572130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMR-VPY1-F021-633K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Yet, lacking any central authority, it has also given every malcontent a megaphone and thereby an opportunity to inflict demonstrable damage. The Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have responded to the phenomenon of \"online harms\" with a white paper proposing an independent regulator that would write a code of practice for big tech companies.</p><p>Regulating online content poses risks but there are also real safety concerns about a historically unprecedented technology. The government is right to produce a white paper to examine the issues. If there is to be regulation, it is better that it develop through scrutiny and parliamentary debate, rather than that government proceed by fiat driven by public outrage at particular infractions of online freedom.</p><p>The white paper proposes a new statutory duty of care on the part of technology companies, with regulatory powers to levy big fines and impose liability on senior members of management. And the problem it points to is undeniable. Disturbing examples of online harm are legion, and websites promoting self-harm may have contributed to deaths of young people. After Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017, her parents found material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account.</p><p>Beyond these tragic cases is a culture of enmity that social media has not invented but has given wings. Almost anyone who uses Twitter or Facebook will be aware of the ease with which the hateful sentiments of racists, xenophobes and antisemites and Islamophobes are disseminated. When a fanatic murdered scores of worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, in New Zealand, last month he broadcast his depravities in real time on Facebook. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, complains that tech companies have allowed parts of the internet to become \"a hunting ground for monsters\". It is difficult to gainsay this judgment.</p><p>Critics are not wrong to be wary, however. Free speech is the bedrock of a democratic society and, by definition, that principle is tested by its most difficult cases. Social media has brought into sharp relief the phenomenon of malevolent material that has the design (not merely the incidental outcome) of harming vulnerable and impressionable people. Yet the tech companies are not pushing this content of their own volition and it is an error to see them as malefactors. It is rather that they are deliberately uninterested in the content that online platforms spread.</p><p>A hands-off approach is not always irresponsible. Holocaust denial is the archetype of a noxious sentiment founded on bigotry and fraud and that may sway impressionable people who stumble across its facade of inquiry. There are laws against it in some European countries but none in Britain.</p><p>It would be a mistake to suppress such fakery by statute. The proper recourse is historical scholarship and the irrefutable evidence derived from genuine research. The problem arises with material that is not only foul but predictably damaging to specified categories of people. To enable, for example, the advocacy of self-harm to teenagers or the mentally ill is grossly irresponsible. There is no need for grandstanding, but there is a serious case for regulation. The government is right to examine it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52828783</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV8-XHV1-F021-633C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Everyone with an internet feed and access to a YouTube channel can be famous for a brief time, and this is a revolution that is constantly being televised. Though there is much to enjoy about the democratic potential of the internet, it is also home to some very dark chambers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People with malign motives and dreadful desires can lurk anonymously online and wait for their opportunity to strike. An investigation by </p><p>                   The Times                   </p><p> has uncovered more than 100 cases in which young people who have been streaming their lives on YouTube have been targeted by the unscrupulous and persuaded to undress or to take up sexualised poses. Children are promised payment in the valuable online currency of extra subscribers if they comply.</p><p>Clearly, the tendency of some young people to want to live out part of their life in public creates an opportunity for exploitation. It is very easy for paedophiles who visit YouTube, owned by Google, to find children online, merely by tapping in a few simple keywords. They can then communicate instantly and directly with the children who are posting there by using the comments section on the site. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat also offer a live streaming service to children.</p><p>Experts in child safety warn regularly of the danger of parents using the internet as a form of babysitting. The more conscious young people are of the possible dangers the better. Still, it ought to be possible for young people to stream incidents from their lives and not be subject, as </p><p>                   The Times                    </p><p>has discovered they are, to gruesome requests to mimic sex acts or take their clothes off.</p><p>The principal responsibility in such instances always lies with the perpetrators. They need to be identified, tracked down and prosecuted. That process would be considerably easier, however, if YouTube, the channel on which a third of children between the ages of six and ten are now broadcasting at least some of their everyday actions, were to do more to intervene. In 2017 Google dropped the requirement for a user to have 10,000 subscribers or more before being permitted to live-stream from a smartphone. Now, almost anyone can do so, which has vastly expanded the range of children live-streaming.</p><p>The Home Office has accused the big tech companies of not doing enough to tackle abuse online and that accusation seems merited in this instance. YouTube failed to remove half the live-streamed videos even though it had been alerted anonymously, by our reporter, to their presence. One commenter had been asking young girls to show their bodies in return for subscribers. That commenter had not been banned from the site. It is unfathomable why not when, according to Jonathan Krause, an expert in countering online crime, some of the comments made could constitute Category A violations, which are considered the most serious type in sentencing guidelines for child sexual abuse offences.</p><p>YouTube should have acted quicker to close channels down. Although YouTube has a minimum user age of 13 it needs to do more to verify the ages of those who are live-streaming and a lot more to regulate the freedom of anonymous people to comment. The very least we can expect is that the company should respond with greater severity when the issue is pointed out.</p><p>The internet is such a vast terrain that it is beyond the capacity of the state to take on the job of online invigilator and it would be inimical to the freedoms of the internet if it were to become too heavy handed in attempting to do so. Yet that requires greater responsibility from the providers than they are showing. The tech companies will leave governments with no other option, if they do not get serious, than to intervene. They will not be able to say they had not been warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-49928121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXP-J361-F021-609X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The critical question for them and their investors, however, is whether anything significant actually flows from it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interrogations of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's parent company Alphabet, was intense and aggressive, and centred - as one would expect from a hearing focused on antitrust issues - on claimed abuses of their market power.</p><p>The question of how the technology giants use their dominant positions in e-commerce has been an increasingly vexatious issue globally, along with the continuing global scrutiny of how much, or how little, tax they pay or should pay.</p><p>The four big platforms, with a combined market capitalisation of close to $US5 trillion (about $7 trillion), between them dominate online retailing and advertising, and the core question explored in the hearing is whether they use that dominance unfairly.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tech CEOs argued that they aren't really that dominant.</p><p>Apple says it holds only 15 per cent of the global smartphone market, Amazon claims a share of only 12 per cent of US retail sales, Facebook cited Chinese social media app TikTok to argue it faces strong competition and Google says it has less than 30 per cent of the US digital advertising market.</p><p>Members of the House anti-trust committee, however, weren't convinced, accusing the companies of abusing their vast hoards of user data to crush competitors, eliminating or acquiring them, and exploiting users by pushing them towards their own products and services and, in the case of commercial users, to unfairly compete with them.</p><p>Republicans, naturally, also accused the platforms of left-wing, or anti-conservative, content bias.</p><p>It is unclear what actions the hearing and the 12-month investigation by the committee that led up to it might result in, if any. The committee can't take action directly against the companies, although it could recommend reforms of the anti-trust laws.</p><p>But it's not the only body looking at the behaviour of the big tech companies.</p><p>'Bring fairness to Big Tech'</p><p>The US Department of Justice is considering whether Google breached anti-trust laws in the online advertising market; the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether Facebook protected its social network's dominance and killed off competitors when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp; and the Justice Department is investigating both Facebook's online advertising practices and the walled garden around Apple's app store.</p><p>The Trump administration has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to review the laws that protect the platforms from liability for the content that they host, and Donald Trump himself tweeted during the hearing that if Congress didn't \"bring fairness to Big Tech\" he would do it himself via executive orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!</p><p>??? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>July 29, 2020</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Around the world, but most particularly in Europe, there have been similar investigations - and some action, including more than $US8 billion of fines for Google - in relation to the way the platforms exploit their dominance. The European Union is drawing up new rules for data-sharing and digital marketplaces.</p><p>Here in Australia, the tech companies face either a voluntary, or involuntary, scheme to compensate media companies for the use of their content and the government - along with most of the rest of the developed world, excluding the US - wants to impose a digital services tax on their activities.</p><p>France tried to do that unilaterally, introducing a 3 per cent tax on digital revenues, but was forced to \"defer\" its implementation from April to December this year after Trump threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs on French wine and other products. There needs to be a global consensus, and US acceptance, if digital services taxes are to be imposed.</p><p>Regulators' dilemma</p><p>There is evidence that the platforms have misused customer and third-party data and acquired competitors (allegedly after actively weakening them) or used their insights to compete with their own customers in order to enhance or protect their dominance.</p><p>Against that, it is inarguable that they have also generated enormous innovation and consumer benefit.</p><p>There is a question as to whether these gatekeepers to 21st century commerce effectively charge too much for access and whether the economic detriment of their dominance outweighs those benefits, but the core of their dominance rests on their appeal to users.</p><p>The dilemma for legislators and regulators is how to preserve the benefits of the Big Tech scale and innovation while curtailing behaviour that unfairly extends that dominance and protects the companies from competitors. That may, or may not, involve some forced divestments or structural separations of some of their activities.</p><p>Patient capital</p><p>Under-explored in the debate about the remarkable rise of the big tech companies is the role that capital has played. They have had, and continue to have, a massive cost of capital advantage over traditional competitors and the nature of the capital they attract is different.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has by choice never delivered the profitability that its scale and business model could deliver, choosing instead to sacrifice profits to invest in expanding and deepening its operations and under-cutting competitors to maximise its eventual global market positions.</p><p>Investors who dump their holdings in, for instance, brick and mortar retailers when they barely miss market expectations, have been prepared to fund Amazon's strategy and capitalise its possibilities in a way they wouldn't even contemplate for a company that didn't have a dot.com in its name. That capital is not only prepared to tolerate sub-optimal profitability, but is truly patient.</p><p>It's a priceless advantage, and a very substantial one, that neither the competitors nor the legislators and regulators trying to put some boundaries around the big tech companies' quasi-monopolies can do anything about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520307656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-N081-DY19-C3GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1062\"/><timeReceived>11:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The critical question for them and their investors, however, is whether anything significant actually flows from it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interrogations of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's parent company Alphabet, was intense and aggressive, and centred - as one would expect from a hearing focused on antitrust issues - on claimed abuses of their market power.</p><p>The question of how the technology giants use their dominant positions in e-commerce has been an increasingly vexatious issue globally, along with the continuing global scrutiny of how much, or how little, tax they pay or should pay.</p><p>The four big platforms, with a combined market capitalisation of close to $US5 trillion (about $7 trillion), between them dominate online retailing and advertising, and the core question explored in the hearing is whether they use that dominance unfairly.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tech CEOs argued that they aren't really that dominant.</p><p>Apple says it holds only 15 per cent of the global smartphone market, Amazon claims a share of only 12 per cent of US retail sales, Facebook cited Chinese social media app TikTok to argue it faces strong competition and Google says it has less than 30 per cent of the US digital advertising market.</p><p>Members of the House anti-trust committee, however, weren't convinced, accusing the companies of abusing their vast hoards of user data to crush competitors, eliminating or acquiring them, and exploiting users by pushing them towards their own products and services and, in the case of commercial users, to unfairly compete with them.</p><p>Republicans, naturally, also accused the platforms of left-wing, or anti-conservative, content bias.</p><p>It is unclear what actions the hearing and the 12-month investigation by the committee that led up to it might result in, if any. The committee can't take action directly against the companies, although it could recommend reforms of the anti-trust laws.</p><p>But it's not the only body looking at the behaviour of the big tech companies.</p><p>'Bring fairness to Big Tech'</p><p>The US Department of Justice is considering whether Google breached anti-trust laws in the online advertising market; the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether Facebook protected its social network's dominance and killed off competitors when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp; and the Justice Department is investigating both Facebook's online advertising practices and the walled garden around Apple's app store.</p><p>The Trump administration has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to review the laws that protect the platforms from liability for the content that they host, and Donald Trump himself tweeted during the hearing that if Congress didn't \"bring fairness to Big Tech\" he would do it himself via executive orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.

The European Union is drawing up new rules for data-sharing and digital marketplaces.</p><p>Here in Australia, the tech companies face either a voluntary, or involuntary, scheme to compensate media companies for the use of their content and the government - along with most of the rest of the developed world, excluding the US - wants to impose a digital services tax on their activities.</p><p>France tried to do that unilaterally, introducing a 3 per cent tax on digital revenues, but was forced to \"defer\" its implementation from April to December this year after Trump threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs on French wine and other products. There needs to be a global consensus, and US acceptance, if digital services taxes are to be imposed.</p><p>Regulators' dilemma</p><p>There is evidence that the platforms have misused customer and third-party data and acquired competitors (allegedly after actively weakening them) or used their insights to compete with their own customers in order to enhance or protect their dominance.</p><p>Against that, it is inarguable that they have also generated enormous innovation and consumer benefit.</p><p>There is a question as to whether these gatekeepers to 21st century commerce effectively charge too much for access and whether the economic detriment of their dominance outweighs those benefits, but the core of their dominance rests on their appeal to users.</p><p>The dilemma for legislators and regulators is how to preserve the benefits of the Big Tech scale and innovation while curtailing behaviour that unfairly extends that dominance and protects the companies from competitors. That may, or may not, involve some forced divestments or structural separations of some of their activities.</p><p>Patient capital</p><p>Under-explored in the debate about the remarkable rise of the big tech companies is the role that capital has played. They have had, and continue to have, a massive cost of capital advantage over traditional competitors and the nature of the capital they attract is different.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has by choice never delivered the profitability that its scale and business model could deliver, choosing instead to sacrifice profits to invest in expanding and deepening its operations and under-cutting competitors to maximise its eventual global market positions.</p><p>Investors who dump their holdings in, for instance, brick and mortar retailers when they barely miss market expectations, have been prepared to fund Amazon's strategy and capitalise its possibilities in a way they wouldn't even contemplate for a company that didn't have a dot.com in its name. That capital is not only prepared to tolerate sub-optimal profitability, but is truly patient.</p><p>It's a priceless advantage, and a very substantial one, that neither the competitors nor the legislators and regulators trying to put some boundaries around the big tech companies' quasi-monopolies can do anything about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520307656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-9T41-DY19-C264-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1062\"/><timeReceived>11:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The critical question for them and their investors, however, is whether anything significant actually flows from it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interrogations of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's parent company Alphabet, was intense and aggressive, and centred - as one would expect from a hearing focused on antitrust issues - on claimed abuses of their market power.</p><p>The question of how the technology giants use their dominant positions in e-commerce has been an increasingly vexatious issue globally, along with the continuing global scrutiny of how much, or how little, tax they pay or should pay.</p><p>The four big platforms, with a combined market capitalisation of close to $US5 trillion (about $7 trillion), between them dominate online retailing and advertising, and the core question explored in the hearing is whether they use that dominance unfairly.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tech CEOs argued that they aren't really that dominant.</p><p>Apple says it holds only 15 per cent of the global smartphone market, Amazon claims a share of only 12 per cent of US retail sales, Facebook cited Chinese social media app TikTok to argue it faces strong competition and Google says it has less than 30 per cent of the US digital advertising market.</p><p>Members of the House anti-trust committee, however, weren't convinced, accusing the companies of abusing their vast hoards of user data to crush competitors, eliminating or acquiring them, and exploiting users by pushing them towards their own products and services and, in the case of commercial users, to unfairly compete with them.</p><p>Republicans, naturally, also accused the platforms of left-wing, or anti-conservative, content bias.</p><p>It is unclear what actions the hearing and the 12-month investigation by the committee that led up to it might result in, if any. The committee can't take action directly against the companies, although it could recommend reforms of the anti-trust laws.</p><p>But it's not the only body looking at the behaviour of the big tech companies.</p><p>'Bring fairness to Big Tech'</p><p>The US Department of Justice is considering whether Google breached anti-trust laws in the online advertising market; the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether Facebook protected its social network's dominance and killed off competitors when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp; and the Justice Department is investigating both Facebook's online advertising practices and the walled garden around Apple's app store.</p><p>The Trump administration has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to review the laws that protect the platforms from liability for the content that they host, and Donald Trump himself tweeted during the hearing that if Congress didn't \"bring fairness to Big Tech\" he would do it himself via executive orders.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!</p><p>??? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>July 29, 2020</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Around the world, but most particularly in Europe, there have been similar investigations - and some action, including more than $US8 billion of fines for Google - in relation to the way the platforms exploit their dominance. The European Union is drawing up new rules for data-sharing and digital marketplaces.</p><p>Here in Australia, the tech companies face either a voluntary, or involuntary, scheme to compensate media companies for the use of their content and the government - along with most of the rest of the developed world, excluding the US - wants to impose a digital services tax on their activities.</p><p>France tried to do that unilaterally, introducing a 3 per cent tax on digital revenues, but was forced to \"defer\" its implementation from April to December this year after Trump threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs on French wine and other products. There needs to be a global consensus, and US acceptance, if digital services taxes are to be imposed.</p><p>Regulators' dilemma</p><p>There is evidence that the platforms have misused customer and third-party data and acquired competitors (allegedly after actively weakening them) or used their insights to compete with their own customers in order to enhance or protect their dominance.</p><p>Against that, it is inarguable that they have also generated enormous innovation and consumer benefit.</p><p>There is a question as to whether these gatekeepers to 21st century commerce effectively charge too much for access and whether the economic detriment of their dominance outweighs those benefits, but the core of their dominance rests on their appeal to users.</p><p>The dilemma for legislators and regulators is how to preserve the benefits of the Big Tech scale and innovation while curtailing behaviour that unfairly extends that dominance and protects the companies from competitors. That may, or may not, involve some forced divestments or structural separations of some of their activities.</p><p>Patient capital</p><p>Under-explored in the debate about the remarkable rise of the big tech companies is the role that capital has played. They have had, and continue to have, a massive cost of capital advantage over traditional competitors and the nature of the capital they attract is different.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has by choice never delivered the profitability that its scale and business model could deliver, choosing instead to sacrifice profits to invest in expanding and deepening its operations and under-cutting competitors to maximise its eventual global market positions.</p><p>Investors who dump their holdings in, for instance, brick and mortar retailers when they barely miss market expectations, have been prepared to fund Amazon's strategy and capitalise its possibilities in a way they wouldn't even contemplate for a company that didn't have a dot.com in its name. That capital is not only prepared to tolerate sub-optimal profitability, but is truly patient.</p><p>It's a priceless advantage, and a very substantial one, that neither the competitors nor the legislators and regulators trying to put some boundaries around the big tech companies' quasi-monopolies can do anything about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520307656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-9T41-DY19-C26D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1062\"/><timeReceived>11:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We did happen to come around several instances of news on tech acquisitions this year, but not all of them were that relevant in terms of the benefits they could reap in the near future. As the acquisition boom continues into the new-year, let's spend some time on few of the top tech acquisitions which set on their initial journey this year and are being expected to be completed by end of the coming year. Here we go.</p><p><br/><br/>A general discussion...<br/><br/>The year saw big tech giants out on the acquisition spree with biggies like Apple (AAPL[1]), Facebook (FB[2]) and Google (GOOG[3]) brokering important deals. The biggest shocker was Facebook's buyout of WhatsApp and the Google's sale of Motorola\u00a0(MSI[4]) followed by the Nest Labs acquisition.<br/><br/>Let's take a look at the latest acquisitions that mattered in the technology world not because of the financial numbers involved but because of the new direction they gave to the acquiring lot, and the new strategies they depicted for the companies that took part in such deals.<br/><br/>The WhatsApp acquisition deal was huge<br/><br/><br/><br/>This deal was announced in early February this year and was closed with a price tag of $22 billion by Facebook, thanks to its increased value of stock in recent month. Facebookpaid $4.98 billion in cash and 178 million of its stock to WhatApp, as well as 46 million of grants in restricted stock units for WhatsApp employees that will vest over a four year period. According to a Bloomberg piece, WhatsApp which had 400 million users in December, generated less than 3 cents in revenue for each one last year. By comparison, Facebookpaid $55 per user when it acquired the company.\"<br/><br/>But Facebookpaid such a huge sum to acquire the loss making company as a part of the management strategy to build its own messaging app and WhatsApp serves this purpose. As a popular social networking site, Facebooknow has a perfect photo sharing app which is Instagram and recently it added the messaging app, WhatsApp adding its list of active users to the kitty. In fact, as recent news sources have rumoured on WhatsApp advocating the addition of the voice calling feature, if the news is confirmed from the company's end, it could offer wings to Facebookand add to its active monthly user count from all perspectives.<br/><br/>Facebook's CEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>has made it clear that WhatsApp is the path for Facebookto get its next batch of 1 billion users as only if the required numbers are achieved, would they start thinking of boosting their revenue and a business model.<br/><br/>Acquiring the music streaming company for diversification<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apple's name is well renowned in the smartphone world and recently it expressed its desire to move into the music streaming industry, and thus to create waves there it confirmed in May this year that it had bought Beats Music for a deal worth $3 billion. Beats co-founders lovine and rapper Dr. Dre joined Apple as part of the acquisition of the music streaming and audio equipment company.<br/><br/>Though Beats Music had only about 200,000 subscribers at the time of the deal, Apple's management seemed stern on this acquisition and were ready to spend their bucks on it. No more news has been sourced on this acquisition but surely we might have to keep an eye on Apple to see how this acquisition aids in entering a new domain of business and prosper just like it has already done in the smartphone and tablet arena.<br/><br/>Motorola earns a bright spot<br/><br/><br/><br/>Google which paid $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola in 2012 announced in January that it would be selling Motorola Mobility to Lenovo (LNVGY[5]). As Moto phones are already generating enough buzz in developing markets like India this deal would be an excellent one for Lenovo as it shows the determination to grow as a smartphone maker in China and the rest of the world.<br/><br/>According to IDC data, Lenovo is the fourth largest smartphone vendor in the world with a 5.2% market share. And now with Motorola under its umbrella, the sales numbers are likely to go up remarkably.<br/><br/>Google added smart-home to its radar<br/><br/><br/><br/>While letting go Motorola, Google was thinking on improving its stand in the \"Internet of things\" space and thus it completed the acquisition of Nest Labs in January this year for a whopping $3.2 billion which was paid in a cash deal.<br/><br/>In a press release on this acquisition, Google stated that Nest would continue to operate independently under its founder, <person><nameText>Tony Fadell. </nameText></person>The internet giant said that the home device maker would retain its own brand identity and that the transaction would be closed in a matter of few months.<br/><br/>It was a sort of homecoming for Nest Labs as Fadell has been an ex-employee of Apple, popularly known as the \"father of the iPod\". As Google explains Nest's mission to be the \"reinvention of unloved but important devices in the home.\" For example, Nest has been selling its Learning Thermostat and smoke detectors and the connected devices aid in controlling it by using apps remotely, like the thermostat can be regulated to raise the temperature up or down.<br/><br/>Thus Google was excited to bring great experiences to homes in more countries and fulfil their dreams through this well-thought acquisition.<br/><br/>In essence, this deal was Google's larger step into the living room, via regular devices made by Nest Labs that help to keep families safe by delivering amazing products.<br/><br/>Parting thoughts<br/><br/>It's unlikely the only acquisitions that took shape during the year, but the ones discussed above were obviously remarkable in their own sense. In the coming year, we might need to stay tuned and watch how these acquisitions take real shape when the financial playbook of the companies reach greater heights as an impact of their decision to grow inorganically this year.<br/>Originally published on GuruFocus.com, link: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/news/301881/the-top-tech-acquisitions-that-created-vibes/newstex\">http://www.gurufocus.com/news/301881/the-top-tech-acquisitions-that-created-vibes/newstex</url><br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL\">http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/FB\">http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/FB</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/GOOG\">http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/GOOG</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/MSI\">http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/MSI</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LNVGY\">http://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LNVGY</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-GURU10864214196305167653768087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GURU-7122</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DXT-54B1-JCMN-Y0NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><timeReceived>9:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GuruFocus.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 26, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The reason: to avoid European Union tariffs responding to those of the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>(The company said they would have averaged an extra $2,200 per motorcycle.) <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeted that he was ''surprised.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  So it seems American companies no longer want to suffer in silence if tariffs affect them.</p><p>  Others may be taking trade war more seriously now, too. The financial markets, which had shrugged off the threat, started to slip yesterday. And Bloomberg Opinion's Brooke Sutherland predicts that Harley's shift could be just the start. (While there's no talk yet of Jack Daniel's moving overseas, Europeans will have to pay more or switch whiskeys.)</p><p>  The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>appears torn about what happens next. A top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, denied reports about the White House planning to limit Chinese investment and tech exports. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said plans were in the works, ''not specific to China, but to all countries that are trying to steal our technology.''</p><p><person><nameText>President Xi Jinping </nameText></person>of China, on the other hand, seems to know his mind. He is said to be telling C.E.O.s that he's ready for a brutal fight.</p><p>  _</p><p>  Andreessen Horowitz catches the crypto bug</p><p>  The venture capital firm has created a $300 million fund focused exclusively on virtual currencies, becoming the first mainstream Silicon Valley investor to do so. (It hired its first female general partner, the former federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun, to help run it.)</p><p>  But the so-called A16z Crypto fund faces a struggle. Cryptocurrencies have plummeted in value this year, and critics still fiercely debate their worth. The latest doubter: Alibaba's <person><nameText>Jack Ma, </nameText></person>who has warned that Bitcoin is likely to be a bubble.</p><p>  None of that worries Chris Dixon, another Andreessen partner coleading the fund. He told our colleague Nathaniel Popper:</p><p>  ''The prices got ahead of the genuine innovation. The metric I look at is: Are there great entrepreneurs coming in and building great projects? On that metric I think the space is in a really strong place.''</p><p>  More crypto thoughts: Are bans on cryptocurrency advertising by Facebook and Google an antitrust problem?</p><p>  A tight labor market is changing how we think about robots</p><p>  There's a popular narrative about robots: They're coming for your job! But with unemployment at its lowest in years, is that right?</p><p>  In a report about robots in fast-food restaurants, the WSJ finds evidence that, far from replacing humans, they're being used to retain employees who shrink from repetitive tasks and longer opening hours.</p><p>  More from Julie Jargon and Eric Morath:</p><p>  Automation improves consistency, shaves time off tasks, and may help ease the incessant turnover that crimps productivity and staffing across the industry. Alexandra Guajardo, the morning shift leader at a Dunkin' Donuts shop in Corona, Calif. said she's likely to stick with the job longer now than she otherwise would have.</p><p>  Other industries have similar problems. Ben Casselman of the NYT finds companies using automation and even training high school students to make up for labor shortfalls. That development, he finds, could change the way economists think about how technology affects productivity.</p><p>  Why an Amex court victory could cheer tech titans</p><p>  The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that American Express didn't violate antitrust law by blocking businesses from directing consumers to credit cards with lower merchant fees. But the ruling could have an impact beyond payment networks.</p><p>  Conservative justices are making it harder for the federal government to use antitrust laws to regulate big business. The Justice Department already failed to block AT&amp;T's bid to buy Time Warner, and regulators now have another antitrust loss on their hands. Noah Feldman of Bloomberg Opinion boils the issue down:</p><p>  If the court becomes more conservative, with the confirmation of justices appointed by President Donald Trump, we are likely to see less and less successful use of antitrust law against big companies.</p><p>  The bottom line: For all the talk about an antitrust crackdown on tech giants like Google and Facebook, judges seem increasingly inclined to limit aggressive enforcement.</p><p>AT&amp;T wants to go after Google and Facebook</p><p>  The telecom giant bought HBO and the Turner cable channels to get into content. But its next ambition, as shown by its deal to buy the ad tech company AppNexus, is to become a force in advertising. By creating a market for ads across TV and video platforms, it could pit itself against the leaders in digital advertising -- Facebook and Google.</p><p>  More from Lara O'Reilly of the WSJ:</p><p>  Several Madison Avenue executives gave a thumbs-up to the deal after reports it was in the works surfaced, predicting it could offer them more choices in the digital ad market. Google took a 31.7 percent share of the $232.27 billion spent globally on digital advertising last year, according to eMarketer, while Facebook took a 17.9 percent share.</p><p>  More media M.&amp;A. news: Gray Television agreed to buy Raycom Media for $3.65 billion in a bid to become one of America's biggest owners of local TV stations.</p><p>  How hedge funds earned millions from Brexit polls</p><p>  When Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, public polls were mostly predicting a vote to remain. But a Bloomberg investigation finds that hedge funds used expensive private polling to predict the correct outcome -- and make millions from the collapse of the British pound.</p><p>  More from Cam Simpson, Gavin Finch, and Kit Chellel:</p><p>  Pollsters sold hedge funds critical, advance information, including data that would have been illegal for them to give the public. Some hedge funds gained confidence, through private exit polls, that most Britons had voted to leave the E.U., or that the vote was far closer than the public believed -- knowledge pollsters provided while voting was still underway and hours ahead of official tallies. These hedge funds were in the perfect position to earn fortunes by short-selling the British pound.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>Morgan Stanley has hired Phil Allison, most recently of the electronic trading firm KCG, to lead the automation of its bond-trading business.

It eclipsed that figure in the first half of this year, according to its IPO filing, with net profit hitting Rmb21.9bn. That growth has impressed analysts, with David Dai at Bernstein Research suggesting that Ant is likely to eventually trade at a similar 30 times earnings multiple as its peers Tencent and Visa. </p><p>Ant\u2019s transformation from a direct provider of financial services to an aggregator of a huge number of customers for other people\u2019s services began in 2017, when regulators in Beijing began to fret at the role the company was playing in the financial system. </p><p>The fees that Ant earned last year matching its users with financial firms\u2019 loan, wealth management and insurance offerings contributed 63 per cent of its revenue in the first half of the year, up from 44 per cent in 2017.\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, Martin Chorzempa at the Peterson Institute of International Economics think-tank noted that large parts of China\u2019s financial system have been reorganised around technology platforms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt's the western bankers' worst nightmare of what would happen under an open banking system,\u201d said Mr Chorzempa. \u201cEssentially, the banks lose their direct relationship with the customer and all of it is mediated by the platform.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Payments\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Ant\u2019s payment app, Alipay, launched in 2004 as a service for shoppers on Alibaba\u2019s ecommerce site. Today, it is used widely in the real world, too, with more than 80m merchants taking payments through the app every month.</p><p>But Ant\u2019s payment business, which processed Rmb118tn ($17tn) of transactions in mainland China in the year to the end of June, is increasingly under pressure from Tencent-owned WeChat. </p><p>Its share of China\u2019s third-party payments market has fallen from three-quarters in the first quarter of 2015 to about half in the first quarter of this year, according to Analysys.\u00a0</p><p>At a store in Qijiayuan market in Beijing selling soft drinks, snacks and wines, almost all shoppers scan either the Alipay or WeChat QR code to pay. \u201cMost customers use WeChat pay these days, very few use Alipay, and even fewer use cash,\u201d said the owner Ms Xiao. Neither Tencent nor Ant charge her a fee for transactions.</p><p>Ivan Platonov of research firm EqualOcean said shoppers prefer to use WeChat because they can easily toggle between messaging on the app and payments. WeChat is also the dominant channel for money transfers between friends and relatives. But Alipay\u2019s monopoly on payments for purchases on Alibaba\u2019s ecommerce platforms helps it remain the leader in online commerce payments, said Mr Platonov. </p><p>Mr Dai said that, while payments is the conduit that draws users into Ant\u2019s ecosystem of other offerings, it is unprofitable as a standalone business line. Partly that is because regulators in 2017 started reducing the amount of unused cash held in user accounts that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b472f73c-859e-11e8-96dd-fa565ec55929\"> payments\u2019 groups</url> could invest for their own benefit, an important source of interest income, from 100 per cent to zero.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The reduction in payments\u2019 share of Ant\u2019s revenue \u2014 from 55 per cent in 2017 to 36 per cent in the first half of the year \u2014 has also helped strengthen Ant\u2019s bottom line.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lending</emphasis></p><p>Consumers paying with Alipay also start borrowing from it. Alipay arranges small loans to consumers and small businesses and earns a service fee from the lender tied to the loan balance.</p><p>Last year revenue from its lending business grew 87 per cent year-on-year to Rmb42bn and it was Ant\u2019s largest revenue driver in the first half. About 500m customers took out loans through Alipay in the past 12 months.\u00a0</p><p>The balance of consumer loans it handed out stood at Rmb1.7tn as of June 30, with 98 per cent of the credit extended by its 100 partner banks or securitised by the company and sold into the market. China\u2019s total credit outstanding on bank cards and credit cards was Rmb6.5tr in the same period.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMuch of the decision making, the data, the risk analysis, the rules, the financial product \u2014 it is all designed by the tech company, not the banks,\u201d said Mr Chorzempa. \u201cThe banks provide the capital, but in a way, the banks are becoming dumb pipes\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009vying for customers and businesses on the platforms of the big tech giants,\u201d he said.</p><p>This year the coronavirus outbreak caused delinquency rates on loans to spike. While Ant is not on the hook for defaults, keeping the rate low is important for its lending partners. The company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba163b00-fd4d-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\"> earlier struggled to turn</url> its heralded credit scoring system, Sesame Credit, into a useful lending determinant and it was only mentioned a handful of times in Ant\u2019s 674-page prospectus as a \u201ctrust score\u201d useful for deposit-free hotel booking and bike rentals. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wealth management</emphasis></p><p>Ant introduced its Yu\u2019E Bao fund in 2013, allowing customers to invest the piles of cash growing in their Alipay accounts. For years its\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8cfb250-b00a-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1\"> Tianhong Asset Management</url> subsidiary invested all of the money and it ranked as the world\u2019s largest money market fund.</p><p>That is no longer the case today, with tighter regulations starting in 2017 gradually forcing Tianhong to shrink the amount each user could invest with the fund. Chloe Qu, an analyst at Morningstar, said regulators took action when they believed the Yu\u2019E Bao fund had grown so large that a wave of withdrawals could cause systemic risk to the financial system.</p><p>Ant now offers competing funds in the Yu\u2019E Bao slot and Ms Qu said most users have little idea which firm is actually managing their money. \u201cIf you can get your product in the Yu\u2019E Bao channel that\u2019s like a money making machine, people are just piling their money in,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>Ant earns a small commission on the money its more than 500m users invest with its asset management partners such as Invesco\u2019s China joint-venture and Bank of China Investment Management.

The headlines: Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Venezuela on a day of rival demonstrations. Police used pepper spray against supporters of the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, in the capital Caracas, while a huge number of pro-government demonstrators also gathered in the city. </p><p>Dozens of civilians have been evacuated from Baghouz, the last village still held by the Islamic State group in Syria. At least four trucks carrying people left the village on Saturday. Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are poised to resume their final push on the area. And R Kelly has been released from prison after the payment of more than $160,000 in overdue child support. The singer has previously spent three nights in jail after being charged in four sex abuse cases, allegations he denies. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from a House of Lords committee, which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self-harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There've been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act, we are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we're discovering in the Brexit process, we can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with the social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications Committee says the industry's responsive has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no one body has complete oversight. So, the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There's also a call for a classification framework similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about. But they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harms. Rob Young, BBC News. Now on BBC News, it's The Travel Show, with flying cars, wait for it - sausage hotels and the campaign to keep Austin, Texas weird. Coming up on this week's show: We are getting weird in the Lone Star state. Doesn't like being on TV! He just bit me! Why flying taxis and sausage hotels are the future of travel. And in the snow and against the clock, I take on the European sauna marathon. I don't quite know the sauna etiquette - I think I'm just gonna myself in there. We start this week in Austin, the state capital of Texas. Every year, it hosts South by Southwest, which has grown from a one-week showcase of the city's musical talent to a massive international festival. So in the face of all that global attention, how do you keep a little bit of local flavour alive? We sent Kate Hardie-Buckley to find out. The city of Austin claims to be the live music capital of the world with over an estimated 300 venues offering a song and dance on any given night. Austin is a phenomenal place if you play the music we play, which is what I call Texas-made honky-tonk, and it's all about the dancin' and having a good time.

There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital oversight, so the boards world, but no one body has complete oversight, so the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. </p><p>There's also a call for a classification framework, similar to that for films. The Government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harms. Rob Young, BBC News. The world's oldest living woman has been recognised by Guinness World Records. She is 116-year old Japanese woman, Kane Tanaka who was born and lives on the southern island of Kooshu. She's in a nursing home, where staff organised a party to celebrate the recognition. Tanka says the secret to her long life are family, sleep and her Shinto faith. Still in good health, her hobbies include board games and calligraphy but she also confesses to a weakness for sweets and canned coffee drinks. Now it's time for a look at the weather with Helen Willetts. Hello there. A turbulent weekend of weather, it has been windy, we have had hill snow through Saturday morning. The afternoon brings further snow showers to the hills. Rain and snow to the north. But fewer showers, more sunshine and an easing of the wind for southern areas, some good spells of sunshine. But this is waiting in the wings and this is going to give us a headache. One weather system approaching from the south and later, one from the West. Although it will feel relatively pleasant out and about in the south this afternoon, a very different complexion to the weather will take place through the night. This comes north, bumping into that cold air so potentially giving us some more hill snow. And as it joins forces with this next weather system coming in from the west which will give more significant snow, the potential is also there for it to whip up into a deep area of low pressure potentially bringing some very windy weather. But significant snow, even to lower levels we could have a couple of centimetres. Ten, 15 centimetres over the hills in the north, clearly a colder day for most of us and feeling so in that potentially very windy weather. Hello this is BBC News. The Headlines. The family of Shamima Begum have called for an urgent review of the government's decision to revoke her citizenship, after her baby son died in Syria. A man charged with murdering Jodie Chesney has been remanded in custody. The 17-year-old was stabbed to death in a park in east London last Friday. The Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay accuses Michel Barnier of trying \"to rerun old arguments\" as talks continue between the UK and EU. Increased activity at a missile site in North Korea - Satellite images of a facility near Pyongyang suggest the country may be preparing to launch a missile or a satellite. Now on BBC News it's The Travel Show ? with flying cars, sausage hotels and the campaign to keep Austin, Texas weird. Coming up on this week's show: ... We are getting weird in the Lone Star state. Doesn't like being on TV! He just bit me! Why flying taxis and sausage hotels are the future of travel. And in the snow and against the clock, I take on the European sauna marathon. I don't quite know the sauna etiquette - I think I'm just gonna -- throw myself in there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-b3e116f970c0465892420b2fddd9d123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-J3T1-JBH6-C02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

For that matter, no one knew much about social media or search engines in general.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cellphones were still simply mobile, small and expensive  telephones. There was no concept of a phone as a handheld computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Today, five companies  Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company)  have a collective worth of more than $3 trillion. Yet such transnational companies remain mostly exempt from the sort of regulations and accountability faced by most other industries.</p><p>   Major corporations understandably fear product liability  laws. Oil companies are hectored by class-action lawsuits  and headline-grabbing attorneys badgering them to pay up for supposed climate change brought on by commuters  filling up each week. Tobacco companies have paid out billions of dollars due to cigarettes\u2019 contribution to lung cancer. Pharmaceutical corporations are often forced to pay millions in fines when their prescription drugs cause dangerous side effects.</p><p>   Yet every year, nearly a half-million Americans are injured in traffic accidents due to distracted driving involving a cellphone. No one knows how many millions of people worldwide are addicted to the apps on their smartphones  a habit that can be harder to break than an opiate addiction and can leave addicted users in a similar  zombie-like condition. Yet unlike Big Pharma, Big Oil and Big Tobacco, Big Tech is rarely held responsible for the deleterious effects of its products on millions the world over.</p><p>   In most states, public boards and commissions regulate companies that provide public utilities. The theory is that such corporations use public spaces  from power poles to underground pipelines  to serve a captive public domain and provide an essential need. Radio and television  stations are likewise regulated by the federal government  on the similar assumption that the airwaves are not private property.</p><p>   Tech companies such as Google and Facebook are also utilities of sorts that provide essential services. They depend on the free use of public airwaves. Yet they are subject to little oversight; they simply make up their own rules as they go along. Antitrust laws prohibit one corporation  from unfairly devouring its competition, capturing most of its market and then price-gouging as it sees fit without fear of competition. Google has all but destroyed its search engine competitors in the same manner that Facebook has driven out competing social media.</p><p>Facebook and Google are now called a \"duopoly.\" The two companies rake in roughly half of all internet ad revenue.  Both companies sometimes censor and electronically  snoop on their customers, massaging everything from the daily news to what we should buy. Could a Silicon Valley  startup company offer an alternative to either Facebook  or Google? It would likely be bought out or crushed the moment it became large enough to gain notice.</p><p>   Why are huge tech companies seemingly exempt from the rules that older corporations must follow?</p><p>   First, their CEOs wisely cultivate the image of hipsters.  The public sees them more as aging teenagers in Tshirts,  turtlenecks and flip-flops than as updated versions of J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller or other robber barons of the past.</p><p>   Second, the tech industry\u2019s hierarchy is politically progressive.  In brilliant marketing fashion, the internet, laptops,  tablets and smartphones have meshed with the hip youth culture of music, television, the movies, universities  and fashion. Think Woodstock rather than Wall Street.</p><p>   Corporate spokesmen at companies such as Twitter and YouTube brag about their social awareness, especially on issues such as radical environmentalism, identity politics and feminism. Given that the regulatory deep state is mostly a liberal enterprise, the tech industry is seen as an ally of federal bureaucrats and regulators. Think more of Hollywood, the media and universities than Exxon, General  Motors, Koch Industries and Philip Morris.</p><p>   Third, the tech industry boasts that it is green and clean. Plastic cords and screens almost magically produce podcasts, videos, email, social media pages and the internet.  Few in the public worry about how lithium-ion batteries  are made, or where and how their ingredients are mined. Pods and pads do not emit smoke. They require no gas, grease and oil. Smartphones and laptops apparently were spontaneously generated out of the clean air of the cool San Francisco Bay area and will dissolve back into it when they wear out.</p><p>   Finally, high tech is an American specialty and a huge earner of foreign exchange. Politicians are understandably  afraid of turning a golden goose into a sick hen. Without taxable trillion-dollar revenues from Facebook, Google and Apple, a dysfunctional, cash-strapped California  would likely go broke.</p><p>   The result is that high tech has become is a brilliant chameleon  invisible in plain sight.</p><p>  (Author Victor Davis Hanson, a historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is a recipient of the 2007 National Humanities Medal.

For that matter, no one knew much about social media or search engines in general.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cellphones were still simply mobile, small and expensive telephones. There was no concept of a phone as a handheld computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, five companies \\x97 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google's parent company) \\x97 have a collective worth of more than $3 trillion. Yet such transnational companies remain mostly exempt from the sort of regulations and accountability faced by most other industries.</p><p>Major corporations understandably fear product liability laws. Oil companies are hectored by class-action lawsuits and headline-grabbing attorneys badgering them to pay up for supposed climate change brought on by commuters filling up each week. Tobacco companies have paid out billions of dollars due to cigarettes' contribution to lung cancer. Pharmaceutical corporations are often forced to pay millions in fines when their prescription drugs cause dangerous side effects.</p><p>Yet every year, nearly a half-million Americans are injured in traffic accidents due to distracted driving involving a cellphone. No one knows how many millions of people worldwide are addicted to the apps on their smartphones \\x97 a habit that can be harder to break than an opiate addiction and can leave addicted users in a similar zombie-like condition. Yet unlike Big Pharma, Big Oil and Big Tobacco, Big Tech is rarely held responsible for the deleterious effects of its products on millions the world over.</p><p>In most states, public boards and commissions regulate companies that provide public utilities. The theory is that such corporations use public spaces \\x97 from power poles to underground pipelines \\x97 to serve a captive public domain and provide an essential need. Radio and television stations are likewise regulated by the federal government on the similar assumption that the airwaves are not private property.</p><p>Tech companies such as Google and Facebook are also utilities of sorts that provide essential services. They depend on the free use of public airwaves. Yet they are subject to little oversight; they simply make up their own rules as they go along. Antitrust laws prohibit one corporation from unfairly devouring its competition, capturing most of its market and then price-gouging as it sees fit without fear of competition. Google has all but destroyed its search engine competitors in the same manner that Facebook has driven out competing social media.</p><p>Facebook and Google are now called a \"duopoly.\" The two companies rake in roughly half of all internet ad revenue. Both companies sometimes censor and electronically snoop on their customers, massaging everything from the daily news to what we should buy. Could a Silicon Valley startup company offer an alternative to either Facebook or Google? It would likely be bought out or crushed the moment it became large enough to gain notice.</p><p>Why are huge tech companies seemingly exempt from the rules that older corporations must follow?</p><p>First, their CEOs wisely cultivate the image of hipsters.</p><p>Second, the tech industry's hierarchy is politically progressive. In brilliant marketing fashion, the internet, laptops, tablets and smartphones have meshed with the hip youth culture.</p><p>Corporate spokesmen at companies such as Twitter and YouTube brag about their social awareness, especially on issues such as radical environmentalism, identity politics and feminism. Given that the regulatory deep state is mostly a liberal enterprise, the tech industry is seen as an ally of federal bureaucrats and regulators. Think more of Hollywood, the media and universities than Exxon, General Motors, Koch Industries and Philip Morris.</p><p>Third, the tech industry boasts that it is green and clean. Plastic cords and screens almost magically produce podcasts, videos, email, social media pages and the internet. Few in the public worry about how lithium-ion batteries are made, or where and how their ingredients are mined. Pods and pads do not emit smoke. They require no gas, grease and oil. Smartphones and laptops apparently were spontaneously generated out of the clean air of the cool San Francisco Bay area and will dissolve back into it when they wear out.</p><p>Finally, high tech is an American specialty and a huge earner of foreign exchange. Politicians are understandably afraid of turning a golden goose into a sick hen. Without taxable trillion-dollar revenues from Facebook, Google and Apple, a dysfunctional, cash-strapped California would likely go broke.</p><p>The result is that high tech has become is a brilliant chameleon \\x97 invisible in plain sight.</p><p>\\x97 Victor Davis Hanson (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:author@victorhanson.com\">author@victorhanson.com</email>) is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and the author, most recently, of \"The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Default No Yes 1</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRVJNL-29157907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRVJNL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFX-XBW1-DY30-14NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146817</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Providence Publications, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Providence Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 21, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp;

We shouldn't. Libra will almost exactly replicate all the problems generated by Facebook's social network. Those problems can in turn be traced to the central paradox of Big Tech: The technological innovation that is supposed to liberate us from government ends up subjugating us to a handful of corporations.</p><p><br/>The key insight underlying Libra is that the transfer of money from person to person is similar to the transfer of information. \"Moving money around globally,\" Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/\">declares in the white paper</url> laying out the company's vision for its new cryptocurrency, \"should be as easy and cost-effective as-and even more safe and secure than-sending a text message or sharing a photo.\" Money is information: When I send money to you, I'm telling the financial system that wealth holdings assigned to me should now be recorded as assigned to you. Financial networks are information networks, just as social networks are. And yet while the internet has revolutionized social networks, financial networks have not caught up. They remain hard to use and expensive, especially for international transactions-whereas, once you own the hardware and obtain an internet connection, social communications are essentially free. In Facebook's vision, the financial network will be modeled on the social network, and eventually the two networks will be merged into a single network, through which we will seamlessly convey to one another money as well as cat photos and political diatribes.<br/>In the name of eliminating inefficiency and injustice in the financial system around the globe, Facebook's new cryptocurrency threatens to replay what's become a familiar story-of tech companies blithely reshaping the world around them, and significantly increasing their power over people's lives, while being accountable to no one.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/facebooks-privacy-promise-comes-15-years-too-late/588808/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What Facebook could have been</url>]<br/>Libra will be a brand-new currency, in spirit the same thing as a dollar or euro. People will obtain Libras by handing over national currency to organizations such as Calibra, the subsidiary that Facebook is creating to handle Libra transactions. Calibra will in turn transfer this money to the Libra Reserve-a group of accounts held by financial custodians around the world. The money that goes into the reserve will be held there or used to buy other currency or low-risk government bonds. Meanwhile, people with Libras can transfer them over the internet, using them to buy things or make gifts. You can exchange your Libras back into a national currency if you need it, with the money coming out of the reserve.<br/>While Facebook advertises Libra as a cryptocurrency, and Libra uses some of the same technology as bitcoin, Libra is actually quite different from bitcoin. There is no bitcoin reserve. If you want to exchange your bitcoin for dollars, you need to find someone willing to buy it. This is the source of bitcoin's volatility: If people decide bitcoins are worth nothing, then no one will buy your bitcoin, and it is worth nothing. If people decide that Libras are worth nothing, they can trade them in for cash from the reserve. And because of this, people won't decide Libras are worth nothing. The problem of volatility is solved.<br/>But this solution comes at a price. And to understand how high this price is, we need some background. Bitcoin was promoted as a decentralized currency. No corporation, government, or other organization ran it. Its protocol guaranteed that a certain number of bitcoins would be produced at a predetermined rate, and this was supposed to guarantee that bitcoins would have a value stable enough for day-to-day transacting. The model was gold-a precious metal whose value remains relatively stable because of the economics of mining. When the market price of gold rises, miners dig deeper, producing more gold, which causes the price to fall. When the price of gold falls, miners stop mining, producing less gold, which causes the price to rise. The bitcoin protocol created a digital version of this process, with the important difference that bitcoins can be sent over the web, unlike gold bars or nuggets. And this meant that, unlike gold, bitcoin was supposed to be a usable currency for people who distrusted government management of national currencies. People could transact and save without worrying that the government would overborrow and then use inflation to wipe away debt. For libertarians philosophically opposed to government management of currency, bitcoin offered a technological solution to the government's historic monopoly.<br/>But in its raw state, bitcoin was too hard to use-and this gave rise to intermediary firms that supplied \"wallets,\" platforms that were accessible to ordinary people. And the important process of confirming transactions (\"mining\" in bitcoin parlance) also turned out to be too complicated for ordinary people-giving rise to sophisticated and wealthy entities that performed this process. Once these large players were in place, they became an oligarchy that dominated the bitcoin world. When the bitcoin protocol needed to be changed from time to time in order to address inevitable problems, the oligarchy made the decisions and profited from them.<br/>We've seen this story before. The early internet itself, along with some relatively simple applications such as email and chat rooms, created a decentralized system of communication over which no central authority-no government, no corporation-exercised much power. But ordinary people did not like the chaos of the early internet. They wanted a more structured environment, and this gave rise to the big social networks, above all Facebook. Once that structure was in place, the system was no longer decentralized. Facebook kept claiming that it was, but made policy choices-about how information was displayed, about the use of data-that harmed a great many people. We now see that Facebook regulates speech and privacy for millions of people, domains normally left to government. What started out as a libertarian utopia is now a highly regulated environment, albeit one regulated by a corporation rather than by our government.<br/>Facebook obviously knows this history. It knows that a fully decentralized Libra would not be usable. But it also knows that the natural solution-a centralized currency controlled by Facebook-would not be trusted. The white paper solves this problem by seizing both horns of the dilemma, claiming that Libra is both decentralized and centralized. Libra is supposedly decentralized because it is based on blockchain, the technology used by bitcoin, which ensures that records are kept by multiple users rather than by one, and in this way enhances security and transparency. Facebook itself will not operate Libra. But Libra is also centralized via the creation of a governance body. That body is the Libra Association, to be located in Switzerland. This body is supposed to prevent the emergence of a bitcoinlike oligarchy to rule over Libra.<br/>But it's hardly clear that, in practice, the Libra Association will act any differently from the oligarchy that dominates the bitcoin world. The white paper provides a few details about how the Libra Association will work. It currently has 28 members, with that number expected to rise to 100. (To get the system started, the members put money in the Libra Reserve, which will enable the creation and circulation of an initial pot of Libras.) Major policy decisions will be made by a two-thirds vote. A small number of nonprofits are given slots, but the majority of members are large profit-making corporations, including PayPal, Facebook/Calibra, Uber, Visa, Mastercard, the telecommunications firm Vodafone, and various venture-capital powerhouses. Ordinary people who buy and use Libras have no votes.<br/>Thus, the Libra system is a somewhat more civilized and open oligarchy than bitcoin's, but it's an oligarchy just the same. How the Libra Association will use its power is anyone's guess. The narrow money-transfer function that Facebook lays out in the white paper is just one possibility-the narrowest and least threatening one. Facebook might sincerely believe that the association will manage the Libra as a kind of glorified Western Union. But Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597221954/facebook-previously-failed-to-keep-privacy-promises-ex-ftc-adviser-says\">has broken its promises before</url>. And even if the social-networking giant envisions the Libra Association as a benevolent, judicious overseer that does only what's necessary to preserve the stability of this new financial medium, the structure of the association allows a far more aggressive type of business.<br/>The Libra Association will, after all, be overwhelmingly controlled by for-profit companies, not by charities. These companies want to make money. The structure of the organization gives them a direct financial interest in the management of Libra because their investment in the reserve entitles them to dividends, which in turn depend on the assets that the reserve holds. If those assets appreciate, the members make profits.<br/>Again, the assets in the Libra Reserve will consist of national currencies and government bonds-at least at the outset. Every time you or I buy a Libra for, say, $1, a portion of that dollar will pay for a government bond whose interest goes to the Libra Association members, not to us. This will prove lucrative for association members if millions of people end up using Libra.<br/>Then again, government bonds pay low interest, and national currencies pay none at all. If the Libra Association members want to increase their returns on their investment, all they need to do is change the composition of assets in the Libra Reserve-a policy shift that they could make by a two-thirds vote. They could then, for example, exchange some of the currency and low-risk debt for somewhat higher-risk debt-by making loans, or by buying loans from banks and other loan originators. And with sufficient diversification, a more aggressive portfolio can be accumulated with relative safety. This is how banks work, and banks, of course, make a lot of money, especially when they are big.<br/>And Libra will be big. Facebook has 2.4 billion users, and if, as Facebook promises, they can costlessly, seamlessly jump from their Facebook accounts to their Calibra wallets to spend money, many of them will do so. Visa has issued more than 2 billion credit cards and is used by more than 40 million merchants. Vodafone has 444 million customers. Uber has 91 million riders. With such a huge user base-many of whom are already the helpless playthings of Facebook's algorithms-the Libra reserve will grow rapidly.<br/>As Libra becomes a juggernaut, expect other huge companies to sign up for membership and then integrate Libra into their operations, delivering millions or billions more users. Currency, like communication, exhibits strong network effects-meaning that it becomes more valuable as more people use it. So the strategy Facebook used so effectively to build its social network-lure in customers with zero-pricing and then make money off them without their realizing it-will work just as well for Libra. Here, though, customers will enrich Facebook and its partners through interest payments on the reserve rather than exploitation of their data-though that might happen, too.<br/>If the Libra Association takes this path, and the Libra Reserve gets big enough, its policies will have macroeconomic impacts throughout the world. The reserve will, at a minimum, hold government debt, and buying the debt of one government rather than another has macroeconomic consequences. If the Libra Reserve lends or buys risky assets, it will affect the global money supply, just like a central bank. Facebook's white paper       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://libra.org/en-US/about-currency-reserve/#the_reserve\">promises</url> that the Libra Reserve will not exercise monetary policy: \"Since Libra will be global, the association decided not to develop its own monetary policy but to inherit the policies of the central banks represented in the basket.\" But deciding not to develop its own monetary policy today doesn't prevent the Libra Association from deciding to develop its own monetary policy in the future. It's clear enough that Facebook knows that Libra will have the capacity to conduct monetary policy; otherwise, there would be no reason to promise that it won't.<br/>But how the Libra Association will use its power is anyone's guess. The white paper is long on happy talk and short on details. The point is that, along a plausible future path, it will gain immense power, and it's not beholden to the public, unlike the central banks that manage national currencies. For all the glitzy futurism of cryptocurrencies, Libra is a step backwards in social and political terms, the way bitcoin tried to throw us back into the age of the gold standard. Until central banks were created in the 19th and early-20th centuries, dead-tree versions of the Libra Association were plentiful. They included family dynasties such as the Medicis and the Rothschilds, and massive private banks. Driven by profit and able to operate across national borders, they accumulated massive political power without feeling loyalty to any particular nation-until governments finally reined them in.<br/>Of course, Libra could fail, or become nothing more than a niche product like Venmo. And it could certainly do some good by reducing the cost of transferring money. But government regulators need to approach Libra with a great deal of skepticism, given Facebook's track record of moving fast and breaking things.<br/>The company has already shown that a successful tech platform can scale up quickly to a once-unimaginable size. An international banklike organization with potentially trillions of dollars in assets and, through its members, ties to billions of users around the world will have a massive influence over people's economic affairs and far too much political power to be effectively regulated by governments-just like Facebook's social network.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-donttrustlibrafacebooksnewcryptocurrency592450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF0-HTB1-DYY9-J2DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

But the backlash to Big Tech and its massive power didn't really gather force until the news broke in the spring of 2018 about Cambridge Analytica's stealthy acquisition of the personal data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>Now America's love affair with Big Tech is clearly over, and we're finally starting to re-evaluate the terms of the relationship. But it remains to be seen whether we will merely patch things up or try to start over on completely new terms. This is not a small question. At stake is whether we continue to let giant tech companies, along with many other Fortune 500 firms, function as the de facto owners and organizers of the 21st century's most valuable underdeveloped resource-our personal information and the connections we make with it-or if we act to reassert control over what should rightfully be ours. To get to that answer, we need to look afresh at what today's data barons actually do.</p><p>The reach of Big Tech and concerns about its power stretch far beyond America's borders. The industry commands territories bigger than the population of nation-states. Facebookistan has 2.3 billion users. Googlestan has more than a billion users of each of seven services (Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, Search, YouTube, and the Google Play Store). Microsoftistan boasts 700 million running Windows 10. And other platforms are also extending their reach: Amazon, which is the starting point for more than half of all online shopping searches in the United States, is now partnering with carmakers to install Alexa in their dashboards; Pok\u00e9mon Go, a Google offshoot, has demonstrated that online gaming can move crowds in real life to \"sponsored locations\"; and iRobot has upgraded its Roomba robot cleaners with mapping capabilities in order to vacuum up their owners' home floor plans.</p><p>As the tech platforms expand into the far corners of the world and every aspect of our lives, public policy and public understanding have trouble keeping up, but several new books provide important insights. In the delightfully titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Zucked</emphasis>, the venture capitalist Roger McNamee recounts his role in the early development of Facebook and his disillusionment with the company. Tarleton Gillespie's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Custodians of the Internet</emphasis> takes us inside the decision-making at tech firms about what communications they allow and what they block. And Shoshana Zuboff's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis>-the most important book I have ever read on the intersection of technology, politics, and society-offers a radical reinterpretation of the changes the tech industry has wrought.</p><p>As a recently woke Silicon Valley capitalist, McNamee has become a traitor to his class, or at least to the young man he once mentored, Mark Zuckerberg, who, at least according to McNamee, has a lot to thank him for. Years before Facebook went public, McNamee urged Zuckerberg not to sell it to Yahoo for a reported $1 billion, and then later suggested he hire Google ad whiz Sheryl Sandberg as his chief operating officer to help him figure out how to make money. But while the enterprise certainly did well, it did not do the good that McNamee expected. \"It turns out that connecting 2.2 billion people on a single network does not naturally produce happiness for all.\" The environment that Facebook created has encouraged people to form \"into clusters or tribes,\" which has led to polarization in the United States and mob violence, even genocide, in other societies.</p><p>In early 2016, McNamee grew concerned about the spread of divisive political content on Facebook driving wedges between Hillary Clinton's and Bernie Sanders's supporters, and then watched the unexpected success of the \"Leave\" campaign in the Brexit vote. Convinced that Facebook's News Feed algorithm was amplifying fear and anger and that bad actors were gaming the system, McNamee tried to sound an alarm with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. But he was fobbed off on one of Zuck's lieutenants, who treated his warnings as a \"public relations problem.\" So he decided to go public with his criticisms, teaming up with former Google ethicist Tristan Harris to create a new organization, the Center for Humane Technology, and to educate lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><p>As McNamee writes, Facebook is, among other things, \"a massive artificial intelligence that influences every aspect of user activity, whether political or otherwise. Even the smallest decisions at Facebook reverberate through the public square.\" One man stands at the center of those reverberating decisions, but how does that decision-making process work, and what rules does it follow?</p><p>The rule-making at Facebook and other platforms about allowable content is the subject of Gillespie's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Custodians of the Internet</emphasis>. Gillespie's custodians are the moderators at social networks, search engines, blogging services, photo- and video-sharing sites, opinion hubs, dating apps, collaborative knowledge tools, recommendation and ratings sites, goods exchanges, fundraising platforms, and video-gaming worlds-in other words, the platforms that consume much of our collective time online. \"All platforms moderate,\" Gillespie writes, even though they downplay how much they interfere. The process of moderation, he shows, is \"a prism for understanding what platforms <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis>, and the ways they subtly torque public life.\"</p><p>As Gillespie notes, the hyperscale of today's online platforms makes individualized content moderation an impossible task, and even with a combination of automated detection using artificial intelligence, community flagging of objectionable content, and editorial review, plenty of objectionable stuff makes it online. To take a relatively benign example, the best \"nudity detection algorithm,\" he observes, claims to spot nude pictures with a 94 percent accuracy rate and a false-positive rate of just 5 percent. With more than a billion active monthly users of YouTube and 350 million photos uploaded every day to Facebook alone, that means plenty of naked pictures make it onto these sites. \"Platforms dream of electric shepherds,\" Gillespie wryly notes. \"But it is not clear that the human labor necessary to support such automated tools can ever go away.\"</p><p>The result, which he explicates with great precision throughout the book, is a new industry of content moderation, with a small elite of policymakers atop the major platforms writing the rules for a burgeoning and largely invisible archipelago of digital sweatshops. That's where hundreds of thousands of so-called \"janitors\"-click-workers making a few dollars an hour in Third World countries, or little more than poverty wages here in America-spend their days dealing with a never-ending flow of traumatizing content.</p><p>Moderators inevitably make contestable judgments. Here, for example, are some of the contradictions in Facebook's policies that Gillespie cites:</p><p>Hate speech is prohibited, but only for protected categories of people (specific races, religions, sexualities, nationalities), and \"migrants\" constitute only a quasi-protected category, so although dehumanizing statements about them should be removed, cursing at them, calling them thieves, and urging them to leave the country do not amount to hate speech. Holocaust denial is allowed, but geo-blocked from countries that outlaw it-not all fourteen countries with laws prohibiting Holocaust denial, just the four that have pursued the issue with Facebook explicitly.</p><p>The custodians of online platforms face an inescapable dilemma: If they don't curate content enough, they risk losing users. And if they curate too much, they risk stifling their own growth and losing favor on Wall Street. Curating is not a role that Big Tech's leaders wanted, as Gillespie points out. They promised an open, participatory culture, but as the promises have soured, the companies are \"grappling with how best to be stewards of public culture, a responsibility that was not evident to them at the start.\"</p><p>Like McNamee, Gillespie frames the trouble with tech as a paradise lost, as though platform makers were just innocent victims of their own success. Who could have known how hard it would be to police sites with billions of users? Who could have imagined that fine-tuning the user experience to show people content they find most engaging would lead to filter bubbles, increased societal strife, and the spread of conspiracy theories? This narrative is overly friendly to Big Tech as it faces its moment of democratic reckoning. Furthermore, it misses the central truths about the forces we are dealing with. To understand those forces, we must turn to Zuboff's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis>.</p><p>For Zuboff, companies like Facebook and Google are not friendly providers of free services such as search engines or social connectivity that just happen to be struggling with the unintended consequences of massive growth. They are the 21st century's robber barons. Only instead of plundering the natural environment, they are plundering us. More or less by accident, they discovered a source of fabulous riches and now, by design, they have created a whole new kind of capitalism, rooted in their ability to track, digest, and with increasing precision, predict and even behaviorally modify everything that we do.</p><p>Our posts, blogs, tweets, and other actions online are what Zuboff calls \"the first text.\" That first text provides us with unprecedented opportunities for connection and knowledge. But that first text also supplies the basis for a second, shadow text. \"Everything that we contribute to the first text, no matter how trivial or fleeting, becomes a target for surplus extraction.\"</p><p>Once you understand the titans of tech as surveillance capitalists bent on capturing as much unguarded human experience as possible, many of their previously curious business decisions become more legible. Google's 2006 purchase of YouTube for $1.65 billion before it had any revenue, its massive expenditures mapping the world for Google Street View, Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram and $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp, Verizon's $4.4 billion purchase of AOL, Microsoft's pivot to providing free cloud services rather than selling licensed software-all of these choices and others too numerous to mention make sense when you think of them not as risky speculation but as the shrewd colonization of raw materials and the protection of supply lines. Maps create empire, Zuboff reminds us, citing the cartographer John B. Harley.</p><p>And the plunder is intensifying, driven by an economic logic now understood by many industries if not the general public. As a senior engineer at a major tech company heavily investing in the so-called Internet of Things told Zuboff:</p><p>\"Imagine you have a hammer. That's machine learning. It helped you climb a grueling mountain to reach the summit. That's machine learning's dominance of online data. On the mountaintop you find a vast pile of nails, cheaper than anything previously imaginable. That's the new smart sensor tech. An unbroken vista of virgin board stretches before you as far as you can see. That's the whole dumb world. Then you learn that any time you plant a nail in a board with your machine learning hammer, you can extract value from that formerly dumb plank. That's data monetization. What do you do? You start hammering like crazy and you never stop, unless somebody makes you stop. But there is nobody up here to make us stop. This is why the Internet of everything' is inevitable.\"</p><p>Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, took off when the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, faced an existential crisis as the first dot-corn boom imploded in early 2000. As graduate students who discovered the value of using web linking patterns to deliver authoritative answers to search questions, they had built a dominant search engine. But they didn't know how to monetize all the traffic Google was drawing, and they were philosophically critical of advertising and its corrupting effects. \"But as the evidence mounted that ads could save the company from crisis,\" Zuboff writes, \"their attitudes shifted. Saving the company also meant saving themselves from being just another couple of very smart guys who couldn't figure out how to make real money, insignificant players in the intensely material and competitive culture of Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>They were also under immense pressure from their venture capitalist backers, one of whom, Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, later revealed that Google's first source of income, selling licenses to the search engine to larger companies, wasn't going all that well. \"Cash was going out of the window at a feral rate,\" Zuboff quotes him as saying. Once Page and Brin agreed to start mining user data to better match ads to their interests, the company's fortune was made.</p><p>As Google learned how much value it stood to unlock from user data, it advanced on two fronts simultaneously, moving from crawling the web to crawling the physical world, while carefully deflecting attention from its real agenda and asserting that the death of privacy was a technological inevitability. Thus, as Zuboff notes, Google chairman Eric Schmidt, upon being asked on CNBC in 2009 why Google retains our search histories indefinitely, replied, \"The reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time,\" as if this was an engineering necessity. \"In truth,\" she writes, \"search engines do not retain, but surveillance capitalism does. Schmidt's statement is a classic of misdirection.\" Had we been able to see these encroachments not as privacy violations alone but as acts of digital dispossession, perhaps the rise of surveillance capitalism would have faced some real roadblocks.</p><p>Instead, its growth was greased by Democratic politicians like Barack Obama, who turned his administration into a Google annex and who, Zuboff writes, \"used his proximity to Schmidt to cement his own identity as the innovation candidate poised to disrupt business as usual in Washington.\" Senator Ron Wyden was primarily responsible for writing Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, a safe-harbor provision that was designed to encourage early platforms such as CompuServe and Prodigy to take active steps to moderate content without holding them legally liable for all that they enabled users to publish. \"What Wyden and his colleagues could not have anticipated, and still do not grasp,\" Zuboff charges, \"is that the logic [of the early internet service provider platforms] no longer holds. ... They no longer merely host content but aggressively, secretly, and unilaterally extract value from that content.\"</p><p>We may individually want to escape this new enclosure movement, but Zuboff is right. We are caught in a Faustian bargain. Being connected is essential for participating in life, but the internet has been commandeered by commerce, and \"commerce is now subordinated to surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>The solutions on offer, she adds, are not anywhere close to addressing the problem at hand. Calls to break up Google or Facebook might simply establish more surveillance capitalist firms, and \"demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand.\" Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation offers hope for a different future, but Zuboff's eagle eye catches Facebook's Zuckerberg characteristically promising to operate according to GDPR's spirit while quietly moving 1.5 billion Facebook users who used to be clients of its Ireland subsidiary back to the mothership in the United States, in order to avoid the law's reach.</p><p>In the last third of her book, Zuboff wrestles with the philosophical implications of a society run by distant technocrats with \"God-like\" knowledge of humanity's desires and actions, delving into the intellectual roots of such thinking in the works of Harvard behaviorist B.F. Skinner. She theorizes that surveillance capitalists are not digital totalitarians but a new form of overlord, \"instrumentarians\" indifferent to the day-to-day effects of their platforms as long as the raw materials flow into their analytical maws unmolested. This section could have been a whole second book, and readers may find some of her argument repetitive. But these are quibbles against a masterwork of synthesis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</emphasis> is not an obituary for democracy. Zuboff has provided the latticework on which to hang useful new initiatives. \"We have yet to invent the politics and new forms of collaborative action ... that effectively assert the people's right to a human future,\" she writes. But now that she has named the system, described it, analyzed it, and helped us understand it, we may begin to change it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMPROS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMPROS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW5-5J91-JC8V-41BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The American Prospect, Inc.</copyright><publicationName><br/>The American Prospect</publicationName><volume>VOLUME 30</volume><issueNumber>NUMBER 2</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>2019 Spring</dateText><date month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"/><date month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"/></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We need to catch up with reality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-352f96cad34811ea9038af089b63ac21</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H3-P6R1-DYX1-H00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><timeReceived>11:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We're intending to  put unprecedented pressure on Iran. Their currency is going through the  floor, much of that in the past 90 days. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump appears to be threatening any country that does  business with Iran by blowing up the Iran deal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In the spring, we lost the support we had, which was  hard to achieve from Russia and China, and obviously the E.U. </p><p> BOLTON:  Why do you want to do business with the world's largest financier  of international terrorism? Really, the central bank of international  terrorism. Do your shareholders feel good that you are doing business with  a terrorist regime, that's the sort of thing I think everybody needs to  ask. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  And the pressure is now on. President  Trump warning European countries -- companies, you do business with Iran,  you will not be doing business with the United States.</p><p> Now look at this. German carmaker Daimler did changed its expansion plans  in Iran. So who is next to fall in line? We've got the names coming up. And  you will not believe which European country is now stepping up. </p><p> And Iran's President Hassan Rouhani saying Iran cannot negotiate with U.S.  while under sanctions. Accusing the U.S. of, quote, \"psychological  warfare.\" We debate that. </p><p> And coming up too, the latest on conservatives getting assaulted in public. </p><p> And also this, Tesla stock halted in trading today after billionaire,  speaking of Elon Musk, he tweeted out that he may take Tesla's private. It  was a tweet heard around the world. We've got the latest on that, and also  Disney earnings and more.</p><p> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p> All right. Let's get right to your money. Look at this. The Dow finishing  up 126 points to 25,628. It's sleepy August, the Dow continues to go up.  The S&amp;P climbing to less than 1 percent from a new record. Tesla and Amazon  on the move. More on your money in just a second.</p><p> But first, President Trump sanctions on Iran went into effect today, and  businesses from Berlin, Paris, Rome to London now feeling pressure to back  off from doing business in Iran. </p><p> And Germany is the country now stepping up and reportedly moving to stop  the transfer of nearly $400 million in cash out of Germany to the Iranian  regime. Iran wants its money. They want that 400 million now. To avoid that  money being detained under looming sanctions.</p><p> While U.S. sanctions were also causing German auto giant Daimler, the maker  of Mercedes, to abandon their expansion plans in Iran. Look at this. The  maker of Peugeot cars, also the French oil company Total, and Germany's  Siemens have also backed off. </p><p> A U.S. official now says nearly 100 international firms have announced they  intend to leave Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also calling out to  European companies saying it is time to make a choice. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  What is it about the ayatollah  that you like? Why do you stand with him and against the people he is  oppressing? Why do you want to give a man more money who's taken the money  you've already given him to build the war machine to dismember the Mideast.</p><p> Do you think he is kidding when he says death to Israel? To the Europeans,  you need to get with the Iranian people, and get behind Trump to break this  regime's back before it is too late.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now, we welcome to the show, former U.S. Army  Special Forces, and Security Studies Group president, Jim Hanson. Great to  see you, Jim. So, the threat of being cut off from the U.S. financial  system is it enough for European companies to say you know what, we're not  going to help Iran with its major exports of Islamic revolution, right? </p><p> JIM HANSON, PRESIDENT, SECURITY STUDIES GROUP:  I don't think it's a tough  question from a business perspective when you look at the size of the  economy in Iran and the size of the economy in the United States. So that's  an easy case to make. </p><p> You add on top of that, the fact that Iran is the most malevolent force in  the region, they sponsor terror all over the place and they're oppressing  their own people, stealing their wealth. I don't think it's something that  any decent country should be able to countenance. And right now, they seem  to be stepping in line and that's good. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Jim, it looks like we're in a hinge point right now.  And interesting development. Europe was thought to be saying to Iran we  will still work with you on a nuclear deal. </p><p> But now this, Germany, we know that Germany is Europe's economic engine.  The fact that, Jim, it's reportedly moving to stop Iran from getting $400  million in cash out of Germany is significant because Germany's central  bank often partnered with Iran to circumvent U.S. sanctions. </p><p> HANSON:  And now you've got a 100 percent clear message coming out of the  U.S. administration. President Trump said, do business with them, don't do  be with us. John Bolton said, don't buy their oil, stop buying playing with  the mullahs. It's crystal clear. And it's fair. </p><p> You know, the mullahs have stolen when Obama sent all that cash over on  planes, the Iranian people thought maybe they may get a little bit of win  fall from that. Instead it all was stolen by the mullahs or sent to Hamas  and Hezbollah and other terror groups.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And--</p><p> HANSON:  So it's time to change that around and use the money for good. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And Jim, it seems like the Iranian people are saying to Europe,  stand with us, and not those oppressing us. They seems to be saying to the  Democrats and liberal left here in the United States, you, liberal left and  Democrats, stand with the people in the streets of Iran and not those  oppressing us. </p><p> We have President Hassan Rouhani he is now saying Iran cannot talk to the  U.S. while under sanctions. Let's a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator):  What's the meaning  of negotiations when you impose sanctions at the same time? It's like  someone pulling a knife, stab a rival or an enemy in the arms, while at the  same time claiming we should be talking and negotiating. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Your reaction, Jim? </p><p> HANSON:  Come on, Rouhani is a thug, and the bottom line is we don't have a  whole lot to talk to him about. You are absolutely right saying that all  decent people should be standing with the citizens of Iran, the people who  want decent governing. They want to stop being, you have their money stolen  and used for terrorism as opposed to giving them a decent standard of  living.</p><p> So I think now that people are actually looking at that and saying, well,  why would we stand? You know, the Obama administration decided that the  Iranians were a partner for peace. They were wrong, now that reality has  set back in, we can go ahead and flip that on its head and the mullahs need  to suffer, not the people of Iran. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Jim, we also have Trump national security advisor John Bolton  explaining what it would take for a deal with Iran. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  The policy is not regime change, but we definitely want to put  maximum pressure on the government. </p><p> We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for  international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle  East, and their ballistic missile nuclear related programs. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Here's a bit of a disconnect. The White House is  saying it will go after and shut down Iran's oil exports but then it says  it's not about regime change. Can you spell that for us? </p><p> HANSON:  I think the correct policy is the one that John Bolton just  outlined, we want the mullahs to change their malevolent ways. If they  don't do that, who knows what the next step is, you know, it could be that  they are replaced either by the people of Iran or by the simple fact that  they end up bankrupt and unable to maintain their corrupt regime.</p><p> So, I don't think it's a question of the U.S. saying we think everyone  there should change the regime. That's the Iranian people's choice. We just  support their right to a decent government. And that's the right way for  the U.S. to operate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Jim Hanson, president of Security Studies Group. Great to see  you, Jim. Thanks for coming in.</p><p> HANSON:  Good to be with you, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to job. Job gains in the manufacturing sector, in the  last 12 months, the most since 1995. </p><p> And look at this. As the president is moving to retrain our work force and  get better education, we have former education secretary under President  Obama, he is Arne Duncan, he criticize President Trump. Take a listen to  what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ARNE DUNCAN, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:  I'm not sure  President Trump wants to have the best educated workforce. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why is that? </p><p> DUNCAN:  I think it doesn't play to his authoritarian tendencies. He don't  want highly educated people challenging his thinking. He is trying to call  the press the enemy of the people. He is trying to suppress trust in  institutions. Having thoughtful people who think on themselves -- think by  themselves think critically. I'm not sure if that's in his self interest. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, we welcome to the show for her reaction from the Fiscal  Times star columnist, Liz Peek. Great to see you. Your reaction to that? </p><p> LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES:  I think that's an appalling statement.  And I have to say if any group could be accused of not wanting to educate  the people, it's Democrats who basically are all in with the teacher's  union oppose every kind of reform, come out as Hillary Clinton did and the  ACP did against charter schools which in some cities like our own in  Baltimore and other places is the only ticket for kids who are living in  ghettos.</p><p> I mean, this is really -- and actually I'm really shocked by Arne Duncan  because he was a school reformer if you remember in Chicago. Obama had  hired him to be his education chief, and it wasn't until lead up to the  2012 election, when the teacher's union say, hey, you stop with these  reforms or we're not going to back you, then he backed off. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And he said, Arne Duncan said that President Trump wants to  keep the American population uneducated and ignorant because he's  authoritarian. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PEEK:  That is an appalling -- yes, that's an appalling statement. And  look, what is Trump actually doing? He's brought in Betsy DeVos, who is  trying to further other avenues to education for kids that really need a  leg up and haven't been able to get it through our public education system. </p><p> And more importantly, and I think very enthusiastically going after  apprenticeships, which is all to do with educating the workforce and  getting the people in a position where they can get jobs and make a living.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  And learn a trade.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's turn to this tweet that was heard around the world.  Billionaire Elon Musk rocking the markets today, he basically said he wants  to take Tesla private. </p><p> The shares are halted at about 367 a share, they did resumed trading. Musk  saying he, again, wants to take this company, Tesla private. Now Tesla  shares also jumping on a report that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund  bought a $2 billion minority stake in Tesla just below 5 percent.</p><p> Here is Musk's tweet. \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at four -- 420  bucks. Funding secured.\" </p><p> Later company issued a blog post saying no final decision has been made on  this. Musk clarifying in another tweet. \"Investor support is confirmed. The  only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on shareholder  vote.\" </p><p> Look at the stock, surging more than 10 percent after the trading resume,  closing out the day at 379 and change. </p><p> Liz, quite a development. Tesla going private. </p><p> PEEK:  I mean, it's really kind of unheard of for a CEO to tweet a $70  billion transaction, but then a lot of things that this fellow does are  pretty unusual including having to apologize on the latest on earnings call  for bad manners. </p><p> I have to say, reading the blog post in which he enumerates the reasons for  maybe wanting to go private, you kind of end up thinking he is a little bit  of a brat, right? In other words, what's really bothering him, the  scrutiny, the criticism.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Sure.</p><p> PEEK:  The fact that you have enormous shorts out there. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> PEEK:  And I'm sure he is delighting tonight in fact that those shorts took  a huge hit. I've read the number, it's a pretty big number that they lost  because the stock going up 10 percent. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I don't -- you know, I can't recall having cover corporate  accounting, and corporate accounting, I'm not saying this is a scandal, I  just covered corporate accounting at the Wall Street Journal. I can't  recall a company making such a significant statement that moves the market  in such a material way by tweet. </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to wonder if the SEC is going to be taking a look. </p><p> PEEK:  Well, Harvey Pitt has already come out and said, you know, perhaps  this really wasn't legal. I suspect that because now--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Harvey Pitt ran the FCC. </p><p> PEEK:  Yes, former FCC head. I think it has now been judged that you can  make public announcements via Twitter or Facebook, but this is sort of  outrageous it seems to me in that the financing has not been lined up.  Apparently if someone CNBC or someone went out and talked to all the banks,  nobody is saying that they are behind what was it, $70 billion transaction. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Wait a minute. If they did -- if he only had, well, it's a  significant stake at the Saudi Arabia wealth fund.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PEEK:  Well, it's $2 million.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, yes, but it's a good presence to have in there  (Inaudible) other banks in. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PEEK:  Sure. But--</p><p> MACDONALD:  But if there is no other bank funding there then he is going  to--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  Who knows, right? </p><p> MACDONALD:  -- he's in trouble, right?</p><p> PEEK:  We'll see. I mean, you know, I read some of the discourse that came  out after the earnings call, which was very bullish, if you remember. But  then, a couple days later, as is their want they held up 10 Q. The  financial report until after that earnings call.</p><p> And in that financial report there were some pretty troubling things about  the balance sheet, which is really at issue here for this company. They're  going to be -- they're saying they are going to be spending $2.5 billion a  year. Some analysts think that is simply not enough to cover their expected  capital and expenditures and interest payment. So I think there really are  some questions to Tesla's solvency. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. I mean, the debt swamp the shareholder equities.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes. And by the way, going private in some ways would be a good  thing for Tesla. No question. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. I tell you something. When you factor in Musk ownership  stake at around 90 percent, and the shorts at around 27, half of the  company is either owned by the shorts or Musk. I mean, holy Toledo, what a  story this is. </p><p> PEEK:  It is a big story. No question.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Liz, great to see you. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p> PEEK:  Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to your money. We really want to check what's going  on with the markets closing in green. The Dow up 126 points. Walt Disney  reporting a bit of disappointing third quarter. Studio revenue though, grew  20 percent year-over-year, with strong box office sales there.</p><p> Let's get right to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the NYSE with the  latest. Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Immediately following the  numbers on Disney we saw Disney selling off, it missed on the estimates.  And while it did well enough in the movie studio, they have higher  programming cost, and the trend from ESPN continues losing subscribers  there. Watch Disney tomorrow in the trade. </p><p> In the meantime, the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P moved higher. The Dow up  127 points. And the S&amp;P 500 about half a percent away from its all-time  high. </p><p> It is worth noting that as for highs, notable highs, Disney hit a multiyear  high as did Pfizer and Merck. And guess what. Apple hit an all-time high  today as well. I know it pulled back but they are breaking out a little bit  testing the top. Back to you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Thank you, Nicole. We're going to stay on the story  about billionaire Elon Musk, confirming his intention to go private via  tweet. Is this a brave new world for all investors that CEOs could tweet  out information that rocks the markets and change the value of their 401Ks?  We're staying on that story for you throughout the hour. </p><p> Also tonight, a video now going viral. Ivy League millennials trying to  explain what their understanding of the First Amendment is. It did not go  well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any come to mind freedom is under the First Amendment. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Freedom of-- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So at an average 60k a year in tuition what are professors  teaching their kids. We're going to play the full exchange, coming up. </p><p> Also tonight, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to try  to grab more government control of the internet. Judge Andrew Napolitano  says watch out, it's an attack in your First Amendment rights. He's here to  talk about it. </p><p> But first, voting now underway in five states. Bernie Sanders jumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed. He's looking to implement  a bunch of socialist policies in that state. We've got the details and the  debate, coming up. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Voting underway in five states today. Primaries in Kansas,  Michigan, Missouri and Washington. And we have a special House election in  Ohio's 12th district. This as socialist Bernie Sanders is stumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed.</p><p> He's looking to implement socialist policies like, state level single payer  healthcare, free college tuition, end the state's anti-union laws it's  called right to work.</p><p> Let's bring in Wall Street Journal editorial board member, look who's here,  Bill McGurn. You know, Bill, here's the thing with the socialist. I mean,  Alexandria Cortez won 16,000 of the vote.</p><p> WILLIAM MCGURN, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Bernie Sanders 13 million, But then they want to change the  entire U.S. economic system when they don't have a mandate or a majority. </p><p> MCGURN:  Right. And also let's remember, there is a lot of enthusiasm with  Bernie, but there was a lot of enthusiasm in 2016, and he lost to Hillary  Clinton. Which who by all accounts was not the best candidate and so far  the most charismatic. </p><p> So there's -- you know, he may not be quite as popular. He may have a very  intense and dedicated following but it may not be a message that resonates  with a larger audience. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I mean, they only have a fraction of the vote. Bernie Sanders  is 4 percent of the entire population. Cortez 16 -- Cynthia Nixon and  Cortez and Sanders, here's the thing with them, Bill. Do they know that the  Democrat socialist web site says the government will take control of the  energy and steel sectors and turn consumer goods companies like Kimberly- Clark or a Colgate Palmolive into co-op. </p><p> MCGURN:  Right. Right. Look,--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Do they know that that's the cause--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCGURN:  You know the expression if you think things are expensive now,  wait until they are fray?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  That's kind of what we're getting. Look, Bernie Sanders his own  family, his wife manage to college, he talk about free tuition and branded  into the ground.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  It's just it doesn't work. It's an odd argument to be making for  socialism now, when the economy is perking up, and I think people feel it.  I think people feel it in terms of not being trapped in their jobs. </p><p> I have a daughter just starting work out of college. You know, I feel  there's more opportunity. I think people really feel it. So it's an odd for  me to hear this message now. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I hear you. And you're paying a heck of a lot of tuition. </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes. Well, when I stop -- when I stop.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  You still feel that way, that's the point. You know, switching  gears. Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate David Garcia, proposed a  border policy, that is tailor-made for illegal immigrants to pour in over  the border. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID GARCIA (D) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  I want to take just a  second and imagine. Just imagine, just imagine, no wall. No wall in  southern Arizona.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Your reaction.</p><p> MCGURN:  Yes. Lennonism. I mean, John Lennonism, right, in acting? I think  it's kind of silly. Look, I'm more on the pro-immigration side of them, I  have three daughters who are immigrants to this country, but I want a legal  system. </p><p> And I thought that President Trump might be vulnerable a little bit and not  having to deal with the DREAMers. But since the Democrats have moved to the  abolish ICE--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  He gives it a deal. But he had a deal and Democrats-- </p><p> MCGURN:  Right, but I think that might have been used against him. But when  people say abolishing ICE and so forth, it doesn't sound like a policy, it  just sounds ridiculous. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. You know, quickly, the Ohio district vote tonight, people  are saying this could be a referendum of the midterms.</p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is that really true? </p><p> MCGURN:  Well, I mean, I think each race has to be fought individually, but  I think what's interesting about this race, is that I think its suburban  district. And so, what they're worried about for Republicans in suburban  districts, maybe Republican women, softer vote for the president. So it  could be a referendum that way in terms of the swing district. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, but that one a sliver of the voting population. </p><p> MCGURN:  Right. Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So it's really not an overall-- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCGURN:  No. But there are a lot of -- a lot of these swing districts are  up for grabs.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> MCGURN:  And the question is whether they go. The interesting thing is the  Republican have a pretty decent candidate there, he's backed by both Donald  Trump and Governor Kasich. </p><p> MACDONALD:  That's interesting.</p><p> MCGURN:  That has to be the only thing the two men agree on.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, exactly. We love having you on, Bill McGurn. </p><p> MCGURN:  Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  A video now going viral, Ivy League millennials trying to talk  about the First Amendment. Coming up, see if anyone was able to explain  what it is and what's that over pay college tuition is going towards,  that's a middle class family is at stake. </p><p> But first, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to push  for a dramatic and aggressive new plan for the government to -- for the  government to control what you see on the internet. </p><p> Next, Judge Andrew Napolitano he is going to say, this is an attack on  yours First Amendment right, after this. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Welcome back. Coming this September, Senate intelligence  will call in executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet, that's the  parent of Google, to testify. Now that's coming on September 5th about  foreign influence and more happening on their web site.</p><p> This as YouTube, Apple and Facebook did take down contents from info wars  and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy now  demanding tech companies go even further. Murphy is now taking heat and he  is getting heat for sounding like he wants to ban even more sites as well. </p><p> Quote, \"Info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies used site  like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do  more than take down one web site. The survival of our democracy depends on  it\" </p><p> And former Trump economic advisor Gary Cohen is now saying that the banks  were more responsible in 2008 during the crisis than Facebook is today. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, look who's here, Judge  Andrew Napolitano. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Their remedy for hate  speech is more speech, it's not suppression of speech and it's not the  regulation of speech. </p><p> You may disagree with what Alex Jones said, but he has every right to say  it. Now having said that, these platforms are private, Google and Alphabet  and Facebook and Instagram, they're not owned by the government, the First  Amendment does not regulate them, they can kickoff anybody they want. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Are they going to kick off Louis Farrakhan? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know if they can do it. Are they going to kick off  Rand Paul and the libertarian web sites that I go to? So here is the  dilemma. Allowing the private entities to kickoff political opinions with  which they disagree when the sanities are the three or four platforms that  everybody uses in the country versus the government regulating the enemies  or the entities -- I misspoken but that's already in -- regulating these  platforms, and telling them who they have to put on and what you have to do  to get-- </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. So that's the issue. I mean, your point  is well taken. They are private entities. They're allowed to ban whoever  they want. Alex Jones has been called pretty odious for what he believes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's got the right to believe.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  People want to listen to it they can listen to it. The problem  is the barriers to entry, the economic barriers to entry are so great. In a  perfect world people that got banned and people that didn't like the people  that were banned would go to another platform, but there is no other  Facebook at least as far as I know. There's not--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Like big way -- OK. Senate Democrats, look at this, they're now  circulating plans for what they want as basically, being called a crackdown  of the internet. Force social media to verify the geographic location of  all of you in every -- and where you post. Also mandatory identity  verification, also let government researcher access user data, and make  social media legally liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and  disclosure of facts, your private facts. Your take on this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO Well, they should be liable for the negligent or intentional  disclosure of private facts, but they are bulletin board, they shouldn't be  liable for what people post on their bulletin board, the people who post it  should be liable. </p><p> And there are -- there are entities in the United States that will help you  find them if y have to sue them. But this thou shall register with us  before you can use us is outrageous. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's all the government needs -- </p><p> MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... to be able to get into your iPhone online because we posted  something on Facebook. </p><p> MACDONALD: That's First Amendment right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course, it's also the Fourth Amendment, the right to  privacy.</p><p> MACDONALD: There you go. OK, switching gears. Boy, I love it when you come  at me like that. Switching gears, look at this, Campus Reform asks  millennials at Columbia University to name the five freedoms guaranteed by  First Amendment. </p><p> Now, you wonder where the $60,000 a year in tuition goes, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got $20 right here, if you can name all five. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No way I am naming all five. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any come to mind, freedoms under the First Amendment? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The right to a jury by your peers. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am done. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. I'm sorry.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It involves what we're doing right now, all of us.  Assembled? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom of assembly, oh, like to do protests and stuff? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD: The judge is astonished. He's stunned here. You're shaking your  head.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I did this morning with Stuart Varney. I did not know  this was Columbia University, an Ivy League school. And they don't know the  First Amendment says. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of  speech or interfering with the free exercise of religion or right or  interfering with the right peaceably to assemble and seek redress of  grievances from the government.</p><p> MACDONALD: And petition the government. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: And petition the government. There is also one that the Supreme  Court said is there, which is not there in print. </p><p> MACDONALD: Religion. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: The opposite of speech, silence. </p><p> MACDONALD: Oh, silence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The government can't force speech. I wouldn't expect them to  know that, unless they studied constitutional law. But they should know. It  is an Ivy League school, they should know basically what their freedoms  are. </p><p> MACDONALD: It's astonishing. And you are rightfully shaking your head in  disgust. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD: That's free money down the rat hole and burning. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: I was, but that mentality that the students betrayed...</p><p> MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... is being portrayed by Senator Coons and others that want to  interfere with speech by having the government regulate it.</p><p> MACDONALD: Well, can you come...</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm sure which is more dangerous.</p><p> MACDONALD: Well, this sounds like another segment for you to come on. We'll  have you on again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There you go. </p><p> MACDONALD: Great to see you, Judge. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All the best.</p><p> MACDONALD: We're staying on this story for you because it is a shocker.  Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted out his intention to take Tesla private. That  shot the stock up 11 percent. So can a company do that? Coming up, we have  new details from letter he sent his workers. </p><p> But first, after a weekend of Antifa protests, a group are causing  conservatives -- Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a restaurant in  Philly yesterday, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones, he is fired  up. He is here to react, stay there.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (CROWD PROTESTORS)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD: A group of liberal protesters allegedly aligned with Antifa are  costing conservatives Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a Philadelphia  restaurant they were eating out yesterday. Now as soon as activists heard  that the two were there, they mobilized within an hour, chanting, yelling  vulgarity, blowing whistles in their faces, even throwing water. Police had  to step in for safety reasons. Let's take it up with conservative  commentator, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones. Great to see  you, Lawrence. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p> LAWRENCE JONES, CAMPUS REFORM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Hey, Mac.  Well, I mean,  Liz, it is getting to a point where we really shouldn't be surprised. I  mean, this is a movement that has been out of control since UC Berkeley.  Yet, they are often put in positions where they are not arrested for their  radical behavior, they assault people. And then, us, conservatives and  libertarians are just supposed to sit back as they are a full blown  anarchist. When is enough is enough? </p><p> MACDONALD: OK, the Obamas said when we they go low, we go high. Then we  have Maxine Waters telling people to get in their faces. And now, this,  Lawrence, black and Hispanic police officers protected Charlie Kirk and  Candace Owens, but the liberals who showed up, they screamed F the racist  police, all police are racists. They called Candice Owens and the police  there race traitors. Your reaction?</p><p> JONES: Yeah. And I would like to know that the majority of people that are  talking about race traitors, and calling the cops racists, these are white,  you know, anarchists, members of Antifa. And so, this just shows you that  the left, Liz, this is all a political strategy for them. And I'm not sure  average American people are going to take this much longer. I don't care if  you like Candace or Charlie, they have a right to express whatever opinion  they want. </p><p> MACDONALD: You know, what's so poisonous is what is going on with liberal  left. Is the idea that you disagree with them, that is OK, and they are  allowed to call anybody a Nazi or a white supremacist? They called Candace  Owens a white supremacist. They were saying the same of the police officers  there, who keep them safe everyday. </p><p> JONES: Well, Liz, it's not just name-calling, people can say what they want  to say, but they start throwing, you know, fruit, and water. Honestly, a  lot of them, because I don't know how I would have responded, Liz, if  someone would have assaulted me just because of my political ideology. </p><p> MACDONALD: Has it happened to you, Lawrence? </p><p> JONES: No, but I'm 6'5\" and I'm from Texas. And we don't tolerate that. So  I can't imagine anybody ever trying to do that with me, Liz, to be honest  with you. </p><p> MACDONALD: Well, you come on the show and tell us if it happens, Lawrence  Jones. We love having you on. Thank you for your insights. </p><p> JONES: Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD: All right. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he jolted financial markets with  a tweet, saying he is considering taking Tesla private, some ballpark that  deal a potential 70 billion bucks. We want to get to the guy with the  information in this scoop. He breaks news all day long. He is Fox Business'  Charlie Gasparino, Charlie, wow, what a tweet. </p><p> CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS: Yeah. And it was bizarre what  happened before the tweet, what happened after the tweet. I mean, let's put  this in a little bit of context. Tesla is a very heavily shorted stock. You  know, it is fair to say that Elon Musk is at war with the shorts right now.  He has been lashing out at reporters, certain short sellers, claiming  conspiracy to drive down shares. It kind of stopped some of hemorrhaging of  the stock of late, they had better-than-expected -- recently better-than- expected quarter. And then, this is what happened today. </p><p> Stock was basically was heading you know somewhat down in the early  trading, if you take a look at the chart. Then a story leaked in Financial  Times that said -- that saw the sovereign wealth fund was going to buy  about 3 to 5 percent of Twitter shares. Stocks went up -- excuse me, Tesla  shares. And then -- and then, not long after, minutes later, comes this  tweet he is considering going public, in his disclosure -- he disclosed it  in a press release, he didn't disclose it on the PR Newswire. He disclosed  this on his own Twitter page. And stock, as you can see, took off. </p><p> So a lot of it is pretty unconventional stuff. There is a question whether  Elon Musk violated disclosure rules on his disclosure, through the tweet,  probably not. The other -- because he generally discloses stuff on Twitter.  And I think the company has said that, you know, pay attention to his  tweets if you want company news. So, that, they're probably OK on that. I  think what they might get some issues is on the -- just how this thing  leaked out about Saudi Wealth Fund. I mean, was that news which is  obviously peculiar to the stock, who leaked that and why. </p><p> And then, the other question is, Liz, I would say this -- I would say this,  I would say this. What he actually tweeted out, I am considering doing  this, I have funding secured, is all that accurate right now?</p><p> MACDONALD: Yeah, that's the point, Charlie, because you have such great  sources, what if he only has Saudi Arabia stake and no bank saying yeah,  we'll fund it. By the way, Charlie, you make a good point about him and  that pitted battle with the shorts. Who knows if he is just tweeting out to  take out the shorts and create more dead shorts, right?</p><p> GASPARINO: I mean, listen, the shorts are clearly -- I spoke with some of  them today, they are clearly saying that.  You know, Jim Chanos, who is a  legendary short seller (ph), basically a very fundamental oriented short  seller. He looks at numbers. He doesn't like tweet out rumors and  speculations. He short -- the shorts got killed today. There is no doubt  about that.</p><p> I think the real question is, and I am not casting aspersions on this, I'm  not saying this is not true, but if he did not have the financing secure  for taking it private -- because this is a big chunk of change...</p><p> MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p> GASPARINO: We are talking 70 to 80 billion, it depends on your estimates. I  have heard 80 billion being -- that would be, by far, I think the largest  LBO in history of LBOs, right?</p><p> MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p> GASPARINO: I mean, it might get the numbers -- it might get the numbers  right. </p><p> MACDONALD: Well, it sounds right. </p><p> GASPARINO: I mean, just check my numbers on this, but this is huge. If he  doesn't have the financing secured for this and he tweeted he did, well,  that's a problem. </p><p> MACDONALD: That means he was taking out shorts. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GASPARINO: It means he is not -- he is releasing stuff for the investing  public that is not accurate.</p><p> MACDONALD: That's right.</p><p> GASPARINO: That's the problem. </p><p> MACDONALD: Good to see you, Charlie. Great stuff there. Come back on soon.</p><p> GASPARINO: OK. </p><p> MACDONALD: We love having you on. Now, look at this story, a new high  sensitivity blood test may be able to pick up whether or not you are going  to have a heart attack, faster -- and faster and more accurately  potentially than the existing test. Dr. Siegel is here on that and what it  means for you. </p><p> But we're going to take on Alexandria Cortez again, we've got new stuff,  new debate, what is she saying today? You won't believe what she said  today. My panel takes its on next, stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: ... of the last, there has  been there reluctance to say, oh, don't moralize the issues. And I push  back on that, because -- like, we are in a time of right and wrong. </p><p> The issues of today are all moral, right to healthcare is a moral issue,  the idea that we have largest population of homeless people since Great  Depression in New York City, is a moral issue. The fact that there are  three empty luxury apartments for every one person experiencing  homelessness is a moral issue. The fact that kids are going into trailers  in back of their schools to get an education, because we won't guild  schools is a moral issue. All of these things are moral decisions.</p><p> We need to take this moment, and we have to -- we really do need to claim  the moral high ground. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD: You've got that right. She is making important point, Alexandria  Cortez about the problems out there and how a lot of them are moral issues.  But then, she is saying basically, I am going to take a moral high ground.  So, here is the problem. Will all of her policy ideas be morally right?  Let's take it up with the political panel, Republican strategist Ford  O'Connell, and Democrat strategist Raj Goyle. So, everything she is going  to do is going to be moral? Ford, is that -- is that what is happening?</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Oh, yes. And that's absolutely the  case, because that's the only way you can sell Medicare for all, free jobs,  free housing, free college education, because these policies, as history  teaches you, ignore modern history, basic math, and rise of oppressive  regimes. When we talk about socialism, E-Mac, you and I hear Venezuela, the  USSR, very bad folks. Well, today's millenials basically hear is what she  is talking about, which is Canada, Switzerland, affordable housing,  affordable college. It's the difference between what we know and what  millenials hear. And that's why it is gaining traction.</p><p> MACDONALD: Cortez is also complaining, Raj, about prosperity. But socialism  didn't make this country prosperous, it was capitalism. And on the  Democratic socialists' website, it says that the government will control  energy and the steel sectors, and also the consumer good sector. That's  what the Democratic socialists want.</p><p> RAJ GOYLE, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Yeah, well, I have to say it is just a  little bit ironic for somebody from the Republican Party to suddenly say  that morality does not have a role...</p><p> MACDONALD: All right. Well, what about what I'm talking about? </p><p> GOYLE: The reality is that actually these issues that she is talking about,  I think I agree with Ford on notion that the younger people in America, the  people who are hurting a lot of Trump base, the same base that actually  voted for Bernie Sanders, when he almost won the Democratic primary...</p><p> MACDONALD: Are you going to answer my question about what I just said about  government controlling the whole sectors of the economy. </p><p> GOYLE: Yeah. Look, everybody is a capitalist. We know that. She said that.  And it is a nice...</p><p> MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p> GOYLE: She is. She absolutely is.</p><p> MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p> GOYLE: Here is the actual issue. </p><p> MACDONALD: Why do you think -- hang on. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD: OK, Ford, stay there. Wait a second. Ford, Ford, why do we think  she is a capitalist?</p><p> O'CONNELL: We don't think that she is a capitalist. And frankly, she is  actually dragging rest of Democratic Party down with her. Look at what she  said about unemployment. The reason why unemployment is low is because  people working two or three jobs. Within five minutes later, Elizabeth  Warren said it is actually because they are working four or five jobs. The  bottom-line is she not a capitalist. What they are looking for is they are  looking to retake power, they're looking to play on people's emotions. And  they're willing to do anything...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD: Hold on a second.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD: One second, one second, one second.</p><p> GOYLE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p> MACDONALD: The point that she is making are good ones. </p><p> GOYLE: Absolutely. </p><p> MACDONALD: There are people suffering out there. </p><p> GOYLE: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p> MACDONALD: Hang on. We're talking about the solutions that work. And the  solutions there have failed in countries around the world. </p><p> GOYLE: The people in this country -- look, I represent a very red district  in the reddest part of the red estate state in this country. I knock on  15,000 doors. My former constituents, now a Trump district, would have  agreed with notion that we need change. And that's why Donald Trump got  elected. He was a change candidate. But the issues, and the reason that I  agree with Ford is that the Republican Party is in absolute meltdown right  now. The only person who has lost a major national election in this cycle  because was he an extremist (ph) is Roy Moore in Alabama. </p><p> O'CONNELL: He was also pedophile, to be honest. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GOYLE: ... who is nominated and the leader of the Republican Party  supported him. Why in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, Liz, is the Republican  Party not even competing because...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'CONNELL: ... in 2005. It is absolutely ridiculous to say we lost the  Virginia race because somehow we could actually compete. Yeah, we could win  now and then in Virginia. In Alabama, guess what, we needed a senate seat  and he didn't back...</p><p> MACDONALD: He put one away.</p><p> O'CONNELL: He backed my former client, Luther Strange, who actually lost. </p><p> MACDONALD: Just hang on a second, we used a harsh term that we can't use on  this network, pedophile, OK? </p><p> O'CONNELL: Sorry about that, my apologies.</p><p> MACDONALD: That's OK. Understood.  Well, we got one more minute to go. I  don't understand why you're saying she is a capitalist because she is not a  capitalist. </p><p> GOYLE: Look, I get -- I get what the objective here is, which is we need a  liberal punching back because...</p><p> MACDONALD: No, no, you are not. I'm sorry.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD: Excuse me, Raj, Raj, you are not answering -- you're not  answering the question of why you claimed she is a capitalist. We got to  have to leave it there. Ford and Raj, thank you so much. I really  appreciate it.</p><p> O'CONNELL: Ty, E-Mac.</p><p> GOYLE: Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD: Now, we have a healthcare game-changer, carmaker GM working out  a deal with a local hospital group, instead of dealing with insurers. GM  saying it's a good thing. We got it coming up. Doc Siegel on that after the  break.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD: Well, look at this healthcare game-changer. Carmaker GM  designing to offer a healthcare plan for workers. To break it down, Doc  Siegel is here. Well, this is a big deal, Doc.</p><p> MARC SIEGEL, FOX BUSINESS: I like this. </p><p> MACDONALD: Why?</p><p> SIEGEL: You know why, it cuts out the middleman, it cuts down costs. The  average is going to be $300 to $900 in premiums less. They are starting it  out with 24,000 employees, but we know General Motors has 180,000  employees. And guess what they're using, Liz, the Henry Ford Healthcare  System in Detroit. How ironic, General Motors going to Henry Ford Hospital.  It's a very good hospital. They're going to be able to get next-day  service. They're going to have access to 3,000 healthcare providers. You're  going to get surgery. It's going to be all in one place. And you know what,  prescription drug prices will be less because again, pharmacy benefit  managers step in and take a profit for negotiating a deal. General Motors  has the power behind it that they can negotiate directly with healthcare  providers, lower costs and lower prices. </p><p> MACDONALD: OK, so, GM is handling it. How are they going to protect them  bottom-line by doing it this way.</p><p> SIEGEL: I think they're going to do that because it is going to cut out  waste. So the bottom-line will be -- will be better, though actually not  waste money. So, again, the money doesn't get chewed up by GM. It gets  chewed up the middleman.</p><p> MACDONALD: You like this. It sounds you really like this.</p><p> SIEGEL: Well, Boeing is doing it. And Intel is doing it. And 11 percent of  all employers are doing it. Everybody knows that the money in the  healthcare system is not lost with the doctor or the patient or even the  employer. It's lost with the insurance companies and with the pharmacy  benefit managers.</p><p> MACDONALD: Wow, what a story. Can you come back on and we'll talk more  about it?</p><p> SIEGEL: I'm very excited about this. It is a private way to cut down  healthcare cost.</p><p> MACDONALD: Doc Siegel, we love having you on.</p><p> SIEGEL: Good to see you.</p><p> MACDONALD: Come back soon. We're going to have more after the break, stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD: Welcome back. Breaking news, the Trump White House set to impose  a second set of tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese imports starting  August 23rd. That's just two weeks away. We're going to stay on that story  for you.</p><p> Well, thank you so much for having us in your homes. Thank you for  watching. Adam Shapiro here now with \"MAKING MONEY.\" Take it away, Adam.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

EVENING EDIT starts right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We're intending to put unprecedented pressure on Iran. Their currency is going through the floor, much of that in the past 90 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump appears to be threatening any country that does business with Iran by blowing up the Iran deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the spring, we lost the support we had, which was hard to achieve from Russia and China, and obviously the E.U.</p><p>BOLTON: Why do you want to do business with the world's largest financier of international terrorism? Really, the central bank of international terrorism. Do your shareholders feel good that you are doing business with a terrorist regime, that's the sort of thing I think everybody needs to ask.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST: And the pressure is now on. President Trump warning European countries -- companies, you do business with Iran, you will not be doing business with the United States.</p><p>Now look at this. German carmaker Daimler did changed its expansion plans in Iran. So who is next to fall in line? We've got the names coming up. And you will not believe which European country is now stepping up.</p><p>And Iran's President Hassan Rouhani saying Iran cannot negotiate with U.S. while under sanctions. Accusing the U.S. of, quote, \"psychological warfare.\" We debate that.</p><p>And coming up too, the latest on conservatives getting assaulted in public.</p><p>And also this, Tesla stock halted in trading today after billionaire, speaking of Elon Musk, he tweeted out that he may take Tesla's private. It was a tweet heard around the world. We've got the latest on that, and also Disney earnings and more.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now.</p><p>All right. Let's get right to your money. Look at this. The Dow finishing up 126 points to 25,628. It's sleepy August, the Dow continues to go up. The S&amp;P climbing to less than 1 percent from a new record. Tesla and Amazon on the move. More on your money in just a second.</p><p>But first, President Trump sanctions on Iran went into effect today, and businesses from Berlin, Paris, Rome to London now feeling pressure to back off from doing business in Iran.</p><p>And Germany is the country now stepping up and reportedly moving to stop the transfer of nearly $400 million in cash out of Germany to the Iranian regime. Iran wants its money. They want that 400 million now. To avoid that money being detained under looming sanctions.</p><p>While U.S. sanctions were also causing German auto giant Daimler, the maker of Mercedes, to abandon their expansion plans in Iran. Look at this. The maker of Peugeot cars, also the French oil company Total, and Germany's Siemens have also backed off.</p><p>A U.S. official now says nearly 100 international firms have announced they intend to leave Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also calling out to European companies saying it is time to make a choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: What is it about the ayatollah that you like? Why do you stand with him and against the people he is oppressing? Why do you want to give a man more money who's taken the money you've already given him to build the war machine to dismember the Mideast.</p><p>Do you think he is kidding when he says death to Israel? To the Europeans, you need to get with the Iranian people, and get behind Trump to break this regime's back before it is too late.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Joining me now, we welcome to the show, former U.S. Army Special Forces, and Security Studies Group president, Jim Hanson. Great to see you, Jim. So, the threat of being cut off from the U.S. financial system is it enough for European companies to say you know what, we're not going to help Iran with its major exports of Islamic revolution, right?</p><p>JIM HANSON, PRESIDENT, SECURITY STUDIES GROUP: I don't think it's a tough question from a business perspective when you look at the size of the economy in Iran and the size of the economy in the United States. So that's an easy case to make.</p><p>You add on top of that, the fact that Iran is the most malevolent force in the region, they sponsor terror all over the place and they're oppressing their own people, stealing their wealth. I don't think it's something that any decent country should be able to countenance. And right now, they seem to be stepping in line and that's good.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Jim, it looks like we're in a hinge point right now. And interesting development. Europe was thought to be saying to Iran we will still work with you on a nuclear deal.</p><p>But now this, Germany, we know that Germany is Europe's economic engine. The fact that, Jim, it's reportedly moving to stop Iran from getting $400 million in cash out of Germany is significant because Germany's central bank often partnered with Iran to circumvent U.S. sanctions.</p><p>HANSON: And now you've got a 100 percent clear message coming out of the U.S. administration. President Trump said, do business with them, don't do be with us. John Bolton said, don't buy their oil, stop buying playing with the mullahs. It's crystal clear. And it's fair.</p><p>You know, the mullahs have stolen when Obama sent all that cash over on planes, the Iranian people thought maybe they may get a little bit of win fall from that. Instead it all was stolen by the mullahs or sent to Hamas and Hezbollah and other terror groups.</p><p>MACDONALD: And--</p><p>HANSON: So it's time to change that around and use the money for good.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Jim, it seems like the Iranian people are saying to Europe, stand with us, and not those oppressing us. They seems to be saying to the Democrats and liberal left here in the United States, you, liberal left and Democrats, stand with the people in the streets of Iran and not those oppressing us.</p><p>We have President Hassan Rouhani he is now saying Iran cannot talk to the U.S. while under sanctions. Let's a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): What's the meaning of negotiations when you impose sanctions at the same time? It's like someone pulling a knife, stab a rival or an enemy in the arms, while at the same time claiming we should be talking and negotiating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Your reaction, Jim?</p><p>HANSON: Come on, Rouhani is a thug, and the bottom line is we don't have a whole lot to talk to him about. You are absolutely right saying that all decent people should be standing with the citizens of Iran, the people who want decent governing. They want to stop being, you have their money stolen and used for terrorism as opposed to giving them a decent standard of living.</p><p>So I think now that people are actually looking at that and saying, well, why would we stand? You know, the Obama administration decided that the Iranians were a partner for peace. They were wrong, now that reality has set back in, we can go ahead and flip that on its head and the mullahs need to suffer, not the people of Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jim, we also have Trump national security advisor John Bolton explaining what it would take for a deal with Iran. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: The policy is not regime change, but we definitely want to put maximum pressure on the government.</p><p>We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle East, and their ballistic missile nuclear related programs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Here's a bit of a disconnect. The White House is saying it will go after and shut down Iran's oil exports but then it says it's not about regime change. Can you spell that for us?</p><p>HANSON: I think the correct policy is the one that John Bolton just outlined, we want the mullahs to change their malevolent ways. If they don't do that, who knows what the next step is, you know, it could be that they are replaced either by the people of Iran or by the simple fact that they end up bankrupt and unable to maintain their corrupt regime.</p><p>So, I don't think it's a question of the U.S. saying we think everyone there should change the regime. That's the Iranian people's choice. We just support their right to a decent government. And that's the right way for the U.S. to operate.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jim Hanson, president of Security Studies Group. Great to see you, Jim. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>HANSON: Good to be with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to job. Job gains in the manufacturing sector, in the last 12 months, the most since 1995.</p><p>And look at this. As the president is moving to retrain our work force and get better education, we have former education secretary under President Obama, he is Arne Duncan, he criticize President Trump. Take a listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNE DUNCAN, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: I'm not sure President Trump wants to have the best educated workforce.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why is that?</p><p>DUNCAN: I think it doesn't play to his authoritarian tendencies. He don't want highly educated people challenging his thinking. He is trying to call the press the enemy of the people. He is trying to suppress trust in institutions. Having thoughtful people who think on themselves -- think by themselves think critically. I'm not sure if that's in his self interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, we welcome to the show for her reaction from the Fiscal Times star columnist, Liz Peek. Great to see you. Your reaction to that?</p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES: I think that's an appalling statement. And I have to say if any group could be accused of not wanting to educate the people, it's Democrats who basically are all in with the teacher's union oppose every kind of reform, come out as Hillary Clinton did and the ACP did against charter schools which in some cities like our own in Baltimore and other places is the only ticket for kids who are living in ghettos.</p><p>I mean, this is really -- and actually I'm really shocked by Arne Duncan because he was a school reformer if you remember in Chicago. Obama had hired him to be his education chief, and it wasn't until lead up to the 2012 election, when the teacher's union say, hey, you stop with these reforms or we're not going to back you, then he backed off.</p><p>MACDONALD: And he said, Arne Duncan said that President Trump wants to keep the American population uneducated and ignorant because he's authoritarian.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: That is an appalling -- yes, that's an appalling statement. And look, what is Trump actually doing? He's brought in Betsy DeVos, who is trying to further other avenues to education for kids that really need a leg up and haven't been able to get it through our public education system.</p><p>And more importantly, and I think very enthusiastically going after apprenticeships, which is all to do with educating the workforce and getting the people in a position where they can get jobs and make a living.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: And learn a trade.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's turn to this tweet that was heard around the world. Billionaire Elon Musk rocking the markets today, he basically said he wants to take Tesla private.</p><p>The shares are halted at about 367 a share, they did resumed trading. Musk saying he, again, wants to take this company, Tesla private. Now Tesla shares also jumping on a report that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund bought a $2 billion minority stake in Tesla just below 5 percent.</p><p>Here is Musk's tweet. \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at four -- 420 bucks. Funding secured.\"</p><p>Later company issued a blog post saying no final decision has been made on this. Musk clarifying in another tweet. \"Investor support is confirmed. The only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on shareholder vote.\"</p><p>Look at the stock, surging more than 10 percent after the trading resume, closing out the day at 379 and change.</p><p>Liz, quite a development. Tesla going private.</p><p>PEEK: I mean, it's really kind of unheard of for a CEO to tweet a $70 billion transaction, but then a lot of things that this fellow does are pretty unusual including having to apologize on the latest on earnings call for bad manners.</p><p>I have to say, reading the blog post in which he enumerates the reasons for maybe wanting to go private, you kind of end up thinking he is a little bit of a brat, right? In other words, what's really bothering him, the scrutiny, the criticism.</p><p>MACDONALD: Sure.</p><p>PEEK: The fact that you have enormous shorts out there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: And I'm sure he is delighting tonight in fact that those shorts took a huge hit. I've read the number, it's a pretty big number that they lost because the stock going up 10 percent.</p><p>MACDONALD: I don't -- you know, I can't recall having cover corporate accounting, and corporate accounting, I'm not saying this is a scandal, I just covered corporate accounting at the Wall Street Journal. I can't recall a company making such a significant statement that moves the market in such a material way by tweet.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: You got to wonder if the SEC is going to be taking a look.</p><p>PEEK: Well, Harvey Pitt has already come out and said, you know, perhaps this really wasn't legal. I suspect that because now--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Harvey Pitt ran the FCC.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, former FCC head. I think it has now been judged that you can make public announcements via Twitter or Facebook, but this is sort of outrageous it seems to me in that the financing has not been lined up. Apparently if someone CNBC or someone went out and talked to all the banks, nobody is saying that they are behind what was it, $70 billion transaction.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wait a minute. If they did -- if he only had, well, it's a significant stake at the Saudi Arabia wealth fund.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Well, it's $2 million.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, yes, but it's a good presence to have in there (Inaudible) other banks in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Sure. But--</p><p>MACDONALD: But if there is no other bank funding there then he is going to--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Who knows, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: -- he's in trouble, right?</p><p>PEEK: We'll see. I mean, you know, I read some of the discourse that came out after the earnings call, which was very bullish, if you remember. But then, a couple days later, as is their want they held up 10 Q. The financial report until after that earnings call.</p><p>And in that financial report there were some pretty troubling things about the balance sheet, which is really at issue here for this company. They're going to be -- they're saying they are going to be spending $2.5 billion a year. Some analysts think that is simply not enough to cover their expected capital and expenditures and interest payment. So I think there really are some questions to Tesla's solvency.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. I mean, the debt swamp the shareholder equities.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. And by the way, going private in some ways would be a good thing for Tesla. No question.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. I tell you something. When you factor in Musk ownership stake at around 90 percent, and the shorts at around 27, half of the company is either owned by the shorts or Musk. I mean, holy Toledo, what a story this is.</p><p>PEEK: It is a big story. No question.</p><p>MACDONALD: Liz, great to see you. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p>PEEK: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to your money. We really want to check what's going on with the markets closing in green. The Dow up 126 points. Walt Disney reporting a bit of disappointing third quarter. Studio revenue though, grew 20 percent year-over-year, with strong box office sales there.</p><p>Let's get right to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the NYSE with the latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Immediately following the numbers on Disney we saw Disney selling off, it missed on the estimates. And while it did well enough in the movie studio, they have higher programming cost, and the trend from ESPN continues losing subscribers there. Watch Disney tomorrow in the trade.</p><p>In the meantime, the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P moved higher. The Dow up 127 points. And the S&amp;P 500 about half a percent away from its all-time high.</p><p>It is worth noting that as for highs, notable highs, Disney hit a multiyear high as did Pfizer and Merck. And guess what. Apple hit an all-time high today as well. I know it pulled back but they are breaking out a little bit testing the top. Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Thank you, Nicole. We're going to stay on the story about billionaire Elon Musk, confirming his intention to go private via tweet. Is this a brave new world for all investors that CEOs could tweet out information that rocks the markets and change the value of their 401Ks? We're staying on that story for you throughout the hour.</p><p>Also tonight, a video now going viral. Ivy League millennials trying to explain what their understanding of the First Amendment is. It did not go well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any come to mind freedom is under the First Amendment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom of--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: So at an average 60k a year in tuition what are professors teaching their kids. We're going to play the full exchange, coming up.</p><p>Also tonight, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to try to grab more government control of the internet. Judge Andrew Napolitano says watch out, it's an attack in your First Amendment rights. He's here to talk about it.</p><p>But first, voting now underway in five states. Bernie Sanders jumping for a Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed. He's looking to implement a bunch of socialist policies in that state. We've got the details and the debate, coming up. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Voting underway in five states today. Primaries in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington. And we have a special House election in Ohio's 12th district. This as socialist Bernie Sanders is stumping for a Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed.</p><p>He's looking to implement socialist policies like, state level single payer healthcare, free college tuition, end the state's anti-union laws it's called right to work.</p><p>Let's bring in Wall Street Journal editorial board member, look who's here, Bill McGurn. You know, Bill, here's the thing with the socialist. I mean, Alexandria Cortez won 16,000 of the vote.</p><p>WILLIAM MCGURN, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Bernie Sanders 13 million, But then they want to change the entire U.S. economic system when they don't have a mandate or a majority.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. And also let's remember, there is a lot of enthusiasm with Bernie, but there was a lot of enthusiasm in 2016, and he lost to Hillary Clinton. Which who by all accounts was not the best candidate and so far the most charismatic.</p><p>So there's -- you know, he may not be quite as popular. He may have a very intense and dedicated following but it may not be a message that resonates with a larger audience.</p><p>MACDONALD: I mean, they only have a fraction of the vote. Bernie Sanders is 4 percent of the entire population. Cortez 16 -- Cynthia Nixon and Cortez and Sanders, here's the thing with them, Bill. Do they know that the Democrat socialist web site says the government will take control of the energy and steel sectors and turn consumer goods companies like Kimberly- Clark or a Colgate Palmolive into co-op.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. Right. Look,--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Do they know that that's the cause--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN: You know the expression if you think things are expensive now, wait until they are fray?</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>MCGURN: That's kind of what we're getting. Look, Bernie Sanders his own family, his wife manage to college, he talk about free tuition and branded into the ground.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>MCGURN: It's just it doesn't work. It's an odd argument to be making for socialism now, when the economy is perking up, and I think people feel it. I think people feel it in terms of not being trapped in their jobs.</p><p>I have a daughter just starting work out of college. You know, I feel there's more opportunity. I think people really feel it. So it's an odd for me to hear this message now.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, I hear you. And you're paying a heck of a lot of tuition.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. Well, when I stop -- when I stop.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: You still feel that way, that's the point. You know, switching gears. Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate David Garcia, proposed a border policy, that is tailor-made for illegal immigrants to pour in over the border. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GARCIA (D) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA: I want to take just a second and imagine. Just imagine, just imagine, no wall. No wall in southern Arizona.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Your reaction.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. Lennonism. I mean, John Lennonism, right, in acting? I think it's kind of silly. Look, I'm more on the pro-immigration side of them, I have three daughters who are immigrants to this country, but I want a legal system.</p><p>And I thought that President Trump might be vulnerable a little bit and not having to deal with the DREAMers. But since the Democrats have moved to the abolish ICE--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: He gives it a deal. But he had a deal and Democrats--</p><p>MCGURN: Right, but I think that might have been used against him. But when people say abolishing ICE and so forth, it doesn't sound like a policy, it just sounds ridiculous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. You know, quickly, the Ohio district vote tonight, people are saying this could be a referendum of the midterms.</p><p>MCGURN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is that really true?</p><p>MCGURN: Well, I mean, I think each race has to be fought individually, but I think what's interesting about this race, is that I think its suburban district. And so, what they're worried about for Republicans in suburban districts, maybe Republican women, softer vote for the president. So it could be a referendum that way in terms of the swing district.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Right, but that one a sliver of the voting population.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: So it's really not an overall--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN: No. But there are a lot of -- a lot of these swing districts are up for grabs.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>MCGURN: And the question is whether they go. The interesting thing is the Republican have a pretty decent candidate there, he's backed by both Donald Trump and Governor Kasich.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's interesting.</p><p>MCGURN: That has to be the only thing the two men agree on.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right, exactly. We love having you on, Bill McGurn.</p><p>MCGURN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: A video now going viral, Ivy League millennials trying to talk about the First Amendment. Coming up, see if anyone was able to explain what it is and what's that over pay college tuition is going towards, that's a middle class family is at stake.</p><p>But first, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to push for a dramatic and aggressive new plan for the government to -- for the government to control what you see on the internet.</p><p>Next, Judge Andrew Napolitano he is going to say, this is an attack on yours First Amendment right, after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Welcome back. Coming this September, Senate intelligence will call in executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet, that's the parent of Google, to testify. Now that's coming on September 5th about foreign influence and more happening on their web site.</p><p>This as YouTube, Apple and Facebook did take down contents from info wars and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy now demanding tech companies go even further. Murphy is now taking heat and he is getting heat for sounding like he wants to ban even more sites as well.</p><p>Quote, \"Info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies used site like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one web site. The survival of our democracy depends on it\"</p><p>And former Trump economic advisor Gary Cohen is now saying that the banks were more responsible in 2008 during the crisis than Facebook is today.</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, look who's here, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Their remedy for hate speech is more speech, it's not suppression of speech and it's not the regulation of speech.</p><p>You may disagree with what Alex Jones said, but he has every right to say it. Now having said that, these platforms are private, Google and Alphabet and Facebook and Instagram, they're not owned by the government, the First Amendment does not regulate them, they can kickoff anybody they want.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are they going to kick off Louis Farrakhan?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't know if they can do it. Are they going to kick off Rand Paul and the libertarian web sites that I go to? So here is the dilemma. Allowing the private entities to kickoff political opinions with which they disagree when the sanities are the three or four platforms that everybody uses in the country versus the government regulating the enemies or the entities -- I misspoken but that's already in -- regulating these platforms, and telling them who they have to put on and what you have to do to get--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's the point. So that's the issue. I mean, your point is well taken. They are private entities. They're allowed to ban whoever they want. Alex Jones has been called pretty odious for what he believes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He's got the right to believe.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: People want to listen to it they can listen to it. The problem is the barriers to entry, the economic barriers to entry are so great. In a perfect world people that got banned and people that didn't like the people that were banned would go to another platform, but there is no other Facebook at least as far as I know. There's not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Like big way -- OK. Senate Democrats, look at this, they're now circulating plans for what they want as basically, being called a crackdown of the internet. Force social media to verify the geographic location of all of you in every -- and where you post. Also mandatory identity verification, also let government researcher access user data, and make social media legally liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and disclosure of facts, your private facts. Your take on this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO Well, they should be liable for the negligent or intentional disclosure of private facts, but they are bulletin board, they shouldn't be liable for what people post on their bulletin board, the people who post it should be liable.</p><p>And there are -- there are entities in the United States that will help you find them if y have to sue them. But this thou shall register with us before you can use us is outrageous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's all the government needs --</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... to be able to get into your iPhone online because we posted something on Facebook.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's First Amendment right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course, it's also the Fourth Amendment, the right to privacy.</p><p>MACDONALD: There you go. OK, switching gears. Boy, I love it when you come at me like that. Switching gears, look at this, Campus Reform asks millennials at Columbia University to name the five freedoms guaranteed by First Amendment.</p><p>Now, you wonder where the $60,000 a year in tuition goes, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got $20 right here, if you can name all five.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No way I am naming all five.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any come to mind, freedoms under the First Amendment?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The right to a jury by your peers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am done.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. I'm sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It involves what we're doing right now, all of us. Assembled?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom of assembly, oh, like to do protests and stuff?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The judge is astonished. He's stunned here. You're shaking your head.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I did this morning with Stuart Varney. I did not know this was Columbia University, an Ivy League school. And they don't know the First Amendment says. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or interfering with the free exercise of religion or right or interfering with the right peaceably to assemble and seek redress of grievances from the government.</p><p>MACDONALD: And petition the government.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And petition the government. There is also one that the Supreme Court said is there, which is not there in print.</p><p>MACDONALD: Religion.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The opposite of speech, silence.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, silence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The government can't force speech. I wouldn't expect them to know that, unless they studied constitutional law. But they should know. It is an Ivy League school, they should know basically what their freedoms are.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's astonishing. And you are rightfully shaking your head in disgust.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's free money down the rat hole and burning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I was, but that mentality that the students betrayed...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... is being portrayed by Senator Coons and others that want to interfere with speech by having the government regulate it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, can you come...</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm sure which is more dangerous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, this sounds like another segment for you to come on. We'll have you on again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There you go.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Judge. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All the best.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're staying on this story for you because it is a shocker. Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted out his intention to take Tesla private. That shot the stock up 11 percent. So can a company do that? Coming up, we have new details from letter he sent his workers.</p><p>But first, after a weekend of Antifa protests, a group are causing conservatives -- Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a restaurant in Philly yesterday, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones, he is fired up. He is here to react, stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTORS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: A group of liberal protesters allegedly aligned with Antifa are costing conservatives Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a Philadelphia restaurant they were eating out yesterday. Now as soon as activists heard that the two were there, they mobilized within an hour, chanting, yelling vulgarity, blowing whistles in their faces, even throwing water. Police had to step in for safety reasons. Let's take it up with conservative commentator, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones. Great to see you, Lawrence. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CAMPUS REFORM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Hey, Mac. Well, I mean, Liz, it is getting to a point where we really shouldn't be surprised. I mean, this is a movement that has been out of control since UC Berkeley. Yet, they are often put in positions where they are not arrested for their radical behavior, they assault people. And then, us, conservatives and libertarians are just supposed to sit back as they are a full blown anarchist. When is enough is enough?</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, the Obamas said when we they go low, we go high. Then we have Maxine Waters telling people to get in their faces. And now, this, Lawrence, black and Hispanic police officers protected Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens, but the liberals who showed up, they screamed F the racist police, all police are racists. They called Candice Owens and the police there race traitors. Your reaction?</p><p>JONES: Yeah. And I would like to know that the majority of people that are talking about race traitors, and calling the cops racists, these are white, you know, anarchists, members of Antifa. And so, this just shows you that the left, Liz, this is all a political strategy for them. And I'm not sure average American people are going to take this much longer. I don't care if you like Candace or Charlie, they have a right to express whatever opinion they want.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, what's so poisonous is what is going on with liberal left. Is the idea that you disagree with them, that is OK, and they are allowed to call anybody a Nazi or a white supremacist? They called Candace Owens a white supremacist. They were saying the same of the police officers there, who keep them safe everyday.</p><p>JONES: Well, Liz, it's not just name-calling, people can say what they want to say, but they start throwing, you know, fruit, and water. Honestly, a lot of them, because I don't know how I would have responded, Liz, if someone would have assaulted me just because of my political ideology.</p><p>MACDONALD: Has it happened to you, Lawrence?</p><p>JONES: No, but I'm 6'5\" and I'm from Texas. And we don't tolerate that. So I can't imagine anybody ever trying to do that with me, Liz, to be honest with you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you come on the show and tell us if it happens, Lawrence Jones. We love having you on. Thank you for your insights.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he jolted financial markets with a tweet, saying he is considering taking Tesla private, some ballpark that deal a potential 70 billion bucks. We want to get to the guy with the information in this scoop. He breaks news all day long. He is Fox Business' Charlie Gasparino, Charlie, wow, what a tweet.</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS: Yeah. And it was bizarre what happened before the tweet, what happened after the tweet. I mean, let's put this in a little bit of context. Tesla is a very heavily shorted stock. You know, it is fair to say that Elon Musk is at war with the shorts right now. He has been lashing out at reporters, certain short sellers, claiming conspiracy to drive down shares. It kind of stopped some of hemorrhaging of the stock of late, they had better-than-expected -- recently better-than- expected quarter. And then, this is what happened today.</p><p>Stock was basically was heading you know somewhat down in the early trading, if you take a look at the chart. Then a story leaked in Financial Times that said -- that saw the sovereign wealth fund was going to buy about 3 to 5 percent of Twitter shares. Stocks went up -- excuse me, Tesla shares. And then -- and then, not long after, minutes later, comes this tweet he is considering going public, in his disclosure -- he disclosed it in a press release, he didn't disclose it on the PR Newswire. He disclosed this on his own Twitter page. And stock, as you can see, took off.</p><p>So a lot of it is pretty unconventional stuff. There is a question whether Elon Musk violated disclosure rules on his disclosure, through the tweet, probably not. The other -- because he generally discloses stuff on Twitter. And I think the company has said that, you know, pay attention to his tweets if you want company news. So, that, they're probably OK on that. I think what they might get some issues is on the -- just how this thing leaked out about Saudi Wealth Fund. I mean, was that news which is obviously peculiar to the stock, who leaked that and why.</p><p>And then, the other question is, Liz, I would say this -- I would say this, I would say this. What he actually tweeted out, I am considering doing this, I have funding secured, is all that accurate right now?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, that's the point, Charlie, because you have such great sources, what if he only has Saudi Arabia stake and no bank saying yeah, we'll fund it. By the way, Charlie, you make a good point about him and that pitted battle with the shorts. Who knows if he is just tweeting out to take out the shorts and create more dead shorts, right?</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, listen, the shorts are clearly -- I spoke with some of them today, they are clearly saying that. You know, Jim Chanos, who is a legendary short seller (ph), basically a very fundamental oriented short seller. He looks at numbers. He doesn't like tweet out rumors and speculations. He short -- the shorts got killed today. There is no doubt about that.</p><p>I think the real question is, and I am not casting aspersions on this, I'm not saying this is not true, but if he did not have the financing secure for taking it private -- because this is a big chunk of change...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: We are talking 70 to 80 billion, it depends on your estimates. I have heard 80 billion being -- that would be, by far, I think the largest LBO in history of LBOs, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, it might get the numbers -- it might get the numbers right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it sounds right.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, just check my numbers on this, but this is huge. If he doesn't have the financing secured for this and he tweeted he did, well, that's a problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: That means he was taking out shorts.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: It means he is not -- he is releasing stuff for the investing public that is not accurate.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's the problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Charlie. Great stuff there. Come back on soon.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK.</p><p>MACDONALD: We love having you on. Now, look at this story, a new high sensitivity blood test may be able to pick up whether or not you are going to have a heart attack, faster -- and faster and more accurately potentially than the existing test. Dr. Siegel is here on that and what it means for you.</p><p>But we're going to take on Alexandria Cortez again, we've got new stuff, new debate, what is she saying today? You won't believe what she said today. My panel takes its on next, stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: ... of the last, there has been there reluctance to say, oh, don't moralize the issues. And I push back on that, because -- like, we are in a time of right and wrong.</p><p>The issues of today are all moral, right to healthcare is a moral issue, the idea that we have largest population of homeless people since Great Depression in New York City, is a moral issue. The fact that there are three empty luxury apartments for every one person experiencing homelessness is a moral issue. The fact that kids are going into trailers in back of their schools to get an education, because we won't guild schools is a moral issue. All of these things are moral decisions.</p><p>We need to take this moment, and we have to -- we really do need to claim the moral high ground.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You've got that right. She is making important point, Alexandria Cortez about the problems out there and how a lot of them are moral issues. But then, she is saying basically, I am going to take a moral high ground. So, here is the problem. Will all of her policy ideas be morally right? Let's take it up with the political panel, Republican strategist Ford O'Connell, and Democrat strategist Raj Goyle. So, everything she is going to do is going to be moral? Ford, is that -- is that what is happening?</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Oh, yes. And that's absolutely the case, because that's the only way you can sell Medicare for all, free jobs, free housing, free college education, because these policies, as history teaches you, ignore modern history, basic math, and rise of oppressive regimes. When we talk about socialism, E-Mac, you and I hear Venezuela, the USSR, very bad folks. Well, today's millenials basically hear is what she is talking about, which is Canada, Switzerland, affordable housing, affordable college. It's the difference between what we know and what millenials hear. And that's why it is gaining traction.</p><p>MACDONALD: Cortez is also complaining, Raj, about prosperity. But socialism didn't make this country prosperous, it was capitalism. And on the Democratic socialists' website, it says that the government will control energy and the steel sectors, and also the consumer good sector. That's what the Democratic socialists want.</p><p>RAJ GOYLE, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Yeah, well, I have to say it is just a little bit ironic for somebody from the Republican Party to suddenly say that morality does not have a role...</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Well, what about what I'm talking about?</p><p>GOYLE: The reality is that actually these issues that she is talking about, I think I agree with Ford on notion that the younger people in America, the people who are hurting a lot of Trump base, the same base that actually voted for Bernie Sanders, when he almost won the Democratic primary...</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you going to answer my question about what I just said about government controlling the whole sectors of the economy.</p><p>GOYLE: Yeah. Look, everybody is a capitalist. We know that. She said that. And it is a nice...</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist.</p><p>GOYLE: She is. She absolutely is.</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist.</p><p>GOYLE: Here is the actual issue.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why do you think -- hang on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Ford, stay there. Wait a second. Ford, Ford, why do we think she is a capitalist?</p><p>O'CONNELL: We don't think that she is a capitalist. And frankly, she is actually dragging rest of Democratic Party down with her. Look at what she said about unemployment. The reason why unemployment is low is because people working two or three jobs. Within five minutes later, Elizabeth Warren said it is actually because they are working four or five jobs. The bottom-line is she not a capitalist. What they are looking for is they are looking to retake power, they're looking to play on people's emotions. And they're willing to do anything...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Hold on a second.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: One second, one second, one second.</p><p>GOYLE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>MACDONALD: The point that she is making are good ones.</p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: There are people suffering out there.</p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: Hang on. We're talking about the solutions that work. And the solutions there have failed in countries around the world.</p><p>GOYLE: The people in this country -- look, I represent a very red district in the reddest part of the red estate state in this country. I knock on 15,000 doors. My former constituents, now a Trump district, would have agreed with notion that we need change. And that's why Donald Trump got elected. He was a change candidate. But the issues, and the reason that I agree with Ford is that the Republican Party is in absolute meltdown right now. The only person who has lost a major national election in this cycle because was he an extremist (ph) is Roy Moore in Alabama.</p><p>O'CONNELL: He was also pedophile, to be honest.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOYLE: ... who is nominated and the leader of the Republican Party supported him. Why in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, Liz, is the Republican Party not even competing because...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL: ... in 2005. It is absolutely ridiculous to say we lost the Virginia race because somehow we could actually compete. Yeah, we could win now and then in Virginia. In Alabama, guess what, we needed a senate seat and he didn't back...</p><p>MACDONALD: He put one away.</p><p>O'CONNELL: He backed my former client, Luther Strange, who actually lost.</p><p>MACDONALD: Just hang on a second, we used a harsh term that we can't use on this network, pedophile, OK?</p><p>O'CONNELL: Sorry about that, my apologies.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's OK. Understood. Well, we got one more minute to go. I don't understand why you're saying she is a capitalist because she is not a capitalist.</p><p>GOYLE: Look, I get -- I get what the objective here is, which is we need a liberal punching back because...</p><p>MACDONALD: No, no, you are not. I'm sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Excuse me, Raj, Raj, you are not answering -- you're not answering the question of why you claimed she is a capitalist. We got to have to leave it there. Ford and Raj, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.</p><p>O'CONNELL: Ty, E-Mac.</p><p>GOYLE: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, we have a healthcare game-changer, carmaker GM working out a deal with a local hospital group, instead of dealing with insurers. GM saying it's a good thing. We got it coming up. Doc Siegel on that after the break.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, look at this healthcare game-changer. Carmaker GM designing to offer a healthcare plan for workers. To break it down, Doc Siegel is here. Well, this is a big deal, Doc.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX BUSINESS: I like this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why?</p><p>SIEGEL: You know why, it cuts out the middleman, it cuts down costs. The average is going to be $300 to $900 in premiums less. They are starting it out with 24,000 employees, but we know General Motors has 180,000 employees. And guess what they're using, Liz, the Henry Ford Healthcare System in Detroit. How ironic, General Motors going to Henry Ford Hospital. It's a very good hospital. They're going to be able to get next-day service. They're going to have access to 3,000 healthcare providers. You're going to get surgery. It's going to be all in one place. And you know what, prescription drug prices will be less because again, pharmacy benefit managers step in and take a profit for negotiating a deal. General Motors has the power behind it that they can negotiate directly with healthcare providers, lower costs and lower prices.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, so, GM is handling it. How are they going to protect them bottom-line by doing it this way.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think they're going to do that because it is going to cut out waste. So the bottom-line will be -- will be better, though actually not waste money. So, again, the money doesn't get chewed up by GM. It gets chewed up the middleman.</p><p>MACDONALD: You like this. It sounds you really like this.</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, Boeing is doing it. And Intel is doing it. And 11 percent of all employers are doing it. Everybody knows that the money in the healthcare system is not lost with the doctor or the patient or even the employer. It's lost with the insurance companies and with the pharmacy benefit managers.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow, what a story. Can you come back on and we'll talk more about it?</p><p>SIEGEL: I'm very excited about this. It is a private way to cut down healthcare cost.</p><p>MACDONALD: Doc Siegel, we love having you on.</p><p>SIEGEL: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Come back soon. We're going to have more after the break, stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Breaking news, the Trump White House set to impose a second set of tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese imports starting August 23rd. That's just two weeks away. We're going to stay on that story for you.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for having us in your homes. Thank you for watching. Adam Shapiro here now with \"MAKING MONEY.\" Take it away, Adam.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018080701cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSKRWD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T09-86D1-JB20-G4C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Evening Edit (formerly Risk &amp;

EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We're intending to  put unprecedented pressure on Iran. Their currency is going through the  floor, much of that in the past 90 days. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump appears to be threatening any country that does  business with Iran by blowing up the Iran deal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In the spring, we lost the support we had, which was  hard to achieve from Russia and China, and obviously the E.U. </p><p>BOLTON:  Why do you want to do business with the world's largest financier  of international terrorism? Really, the central bank of international  terrorism. Do your shareholders feel good that you are doing business with  a terrorist regime, that's the sort of thing I think everybody needs to  ask. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  And the pressure is now on. President  Trump warning European countries -- companies, you do business with Iran,  you will not be doing business with the United States.</p><p>Now look at this. German carmaker Daimler did changed its expansion plans  in Iran. So who is next to fall in line? We've got the names coming up. And  you will not believe which European country is now stepping up. </p><p>And Iran's President Hassan Rouhani saying Iran cannot negotiate with U.S.  while under sanctions. Accusing the U.S. of, quote, \"psychological  warfare.\" We debate that. </p><p>And coming up too, the latest on conservatives getting assaulted in public. </p><p>And also this, Tesla stock halted in trading today after billionaire,  speaking of Elon Musk, he tweeted out that he may take Tesla's private. It  was a tweet heard around the world. We've got the latest on that, and also  Disney earnings and more.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>All right. Let's get right to your money. Look at this. The Dow finishing  up 126 points to 25,628. It's sleepy August, the Dow continues to go up.  The S&amp;P climbing to less than 1 percent from a new record. Tesla and Amazon  on the move. More on your money in just a second.</p><p>But first, President Trump sanctions on Iran went into effect today, and  businesses from Berlin, Paris, Rome to London now feeling pressure to back  off from doing business in Iran. </p><p>And Germany is the country now stepping up and reportedly moving to stop  the transfer of nearly $400 million in cash out of Germany to the Iranian  regime. Iran wants its money. They want that 400 million now. To avoid that  money being detained under looming sanctions.</p><p>While U.S. sanctions were also causing German auto giant Daimler, the maker  of Mercedes, to abandon their expansion plans in Iran. Look at this. The  maker of Peugeot cars, also the French oil company Total, and Germany's  Siemens have also backed off. </p><p>A U.S. official now says nearly 100 international firms have announced they  intend to leave Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also calling out to  European companies saying it is time to make a choice. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  What is it about the ayatollah  that you like? Why do you stand with him and against the people he is  oppressing? Why do you want to give a man more money who's taken the money  you've already given him to build the war machine to dismember the Mideast.</p><p>Do you think he is kidding when he says death to Israel? To the Europeans,  you need to get with the Iranian people, and get behind Trump to break this  regime's back before it is too late.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, we welcome to the show, former U.S. Army  Special Forces, and Security Studies Group president, Jim Hanson. Great to  see you, Jim. So, the threat of being cut off from the U.S. financial  system is it enough for European companies to say you know what, we're not  going to help Iran with its major exports of Islamic revolution, right? </p><p>JIM HANSON, PRESIDENT, SECURITY STUDIES GROUP:  I don't think it's a tough  question from a business perspective when you look at the size of the  economy in Iran and the size of the economy in the United States. So that's  an easy case to make. </p><p>You add on top of that, the fact that Iran is the most malevolent force in  the region, they sponsor terror all over the place and they're oppressing  their own people, stealing their wealth. I don't think it's something that  any decent country should be able to countenance. And right now, they seem  to be stepping in line and that's good. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Jim, it looks like we're in a hinge point right now.  And interesting development. Europe was thought to be saying to Iran we  will still work with you on a nuclear deal. </p><p>But now this, Germany, we know that Germany is Europe's economic engine.  The fact that, Jim, it's reportedly moving to stop Iran from getting $400  million in cash out of Germany is significant because Germany's central  bank often partnered with Iran to circumvent U.S. sanctions. </p><p>HANSON:  And now you've got a 100 percent clear message coming out of the  U.S. administration. President Trump said, do business with them, don't do  be with us. John Bolton said, don't buy their oil, stop buying playing with  the mullahs. It's crystal clear. And it's fair. </p><p>You know, the mullahs have stolen when Obama sent all that cash over on  planes, the Iranian people thought maybe they may get a little bit of win  fall from that. Instead it all was stolen by the mullahs or sent to Hamas  and Hezbollah and other terror groups.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And--</p><p>HANSON:  So it's time to change that around and use the money for good. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And Jim, it seems like the Iranian people are saying to Europe,  stand with us, and not those oppressing us. They seems to be saying to the  Democrats and liberal left here in the United States, you, liberal left and  Democrats, stand with the people in the streets of Iran and not those  oppressing us. </p><p>We have President Hassan Rouhani he is now saying Iran cannot talk to the  U.S. while under sanctions. Let's a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator):  What's the meaning  of negotiations when you impose sanctions at the same time? It's like  someone pulling a knife, stab a rival or an enemy in the arms, while at the  same time claiming we should be talking and negotiating. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction, Jim? </p><p>HANSON:  Come on, Rouhani is a thug, and the bottom line is we don't have a  whole lot to talk to him about. You are absolutely right saying that all  decent people should be standing with the citizens of Iran, the people who  want decent governing. They want to stop being, you have their money stolen  and used for terrorism as opposed to giving them a decent standard of  living.</p><p>So I think now that people are actually looking at that and saying, well,  why would we stand? You know, the Obama administration decided that the  Iranians were a partner for peace. They were wrong, now that reality has  set back in, we can go ahead and flip that on its head and the mullahs need  to suffer, not the people of Iran. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jim, we also have Trump national security advisor John Bolton  explaining what it would take for a deal with Iran. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  The policy is not regime change, but we definitely want to put  maximum pressure on the government. </p><p>We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for  international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle  East, and their ballistic missile nuclear related programs. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Here's a bit of a disconnect. The White House is  saying it will go after and shut down Iran's oil exports but then it says  it's not about regime change. Can you spell that for us? </p><p>HANSON:  I think the correct policy is the one that John Bolton just  outlined, we want the mullahs to change their malevolent ways. If they  don't do that, who knows what the next step is, you know, it could be that  they are replaced either by the people of Iran or by the simple fact that  they end up bankrupt and unable to maintain their corrupt regime.</p><p>So, I don't think it's a question of the U.S. saying we think everyone  there should change the regime. That's the Iranian people's choice. We just  support their right to a decent government. And that's the right way for  the U.S. to operate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jim Hanson, president of Security Studies Group. Great to see  you, Jim. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>HANSON:  Good to be with you, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to job. Job gains in the manufacturing sector, in the  last 12 months, the most since 1995. </p><p>And look at this. As the president is moving to retrain our work force and  get better education, we have former education secretary under President  Obama, he is Arne Duncan, he criticize President Trump. Take a listen to  what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ARNE DUNCAN, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:  I'm not sure  President Trump wants to have the best educated workforce. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why is that? </p><p>DUNCAN:  I think it doesn't play to his authoritarian tendencies. He don't  want highly educated people challenging his thinking. He is trying to call  the press the enemy of the people. He is trying to suppress trust in  institutions. Having thoughtful people who think on themselves -- think by  themselves think critically. I'm not sure if that's in his self interest. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, we welcome to the show for her reaction from the Fiscal  Times star columnist, Liz Peek. Great to see you. Your reaction to that? </p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES:  I think that's an appalling statement.  And I have to say if any group could be accused of not wanting to educate  the people, it's Democrats who basically are all in with the teacher's  union oppose every kind of reform, come out as Hillary Clinton did and the  ACP did against charter schools which in some cities like our own in  Baltimore and other places is the only ticket for kids who are living in  ghettos.</p><p>I mean, this is really -- and actually I'm really shocked by Arne Duncan  because he was a school reformer if you remember in Chicago. Obama had  hired him to be his education chief, and it wasn't until lead up to the  2012 election, when the teacher's union say, hey, you stop with these  reforms or we're not going to back you, then he backed off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And he said, Arne Duncan said that President Trump wants to  keep the American population uneducated and ignorant because he's  authoritarian. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  That is an appalling -- yes, that's an appalling statement. And  look, what is Trump actually doing? He's brought in Betsy DeVos, who is  trying to further other avenues to education for kids that really need a  leg up and haven't been able to get it through our public education system. </p><p>And more importantly, and I think very enthusiastically going after  apprenticeships, which is all to do with educating the workforce and  getting the people in a position where they can get jobs and make a living.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  And learn a trade.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's turn to this tweet that was heard around the world.  Billionaire Elon Musk rocking the markets today, he basically said he wants  to take Tesla private. </p><p>The shares are halted at about 367 a share, they did resumed trading. Musk  saying he, again, wants to take this company, Tesla private. Now Tesla  shares also jumping on a report that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund  bought a $2 billion minority stake in Tesla just below 5 percent.</p><p>Here is Musk's tweet. \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at four -- 420  bucks. Funding secured.\" </p><p>Later company issued a blog post saying no final decision has been made on  this. Musk clarifying in another tweet. \"Investor support is confirmed. The  only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on shareholder  vote.\" </p><p>Look at the stock, surging more than 10 percent after the trading resume,  closing out the day at 379 and change. </p><p>Liz, quite a development. Tesla going private. </p><p>PEEK:  I mean, it's really kind of unheard of for a CEO to tweet a $70  billion transaction, but then a lot of things that this fellow does are  pretty unusual including having to apologize on the latest on earnings call  for bad manners. </p><p>I have to say, reading the blog post in which he enumerates the reasons for  maybe wanting to go private, you kind of end up thinking he is a little bit  of a brat, right? In other words, what's really bothering him, the  scrutiny, the criticism.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure.</p><p>PEEK:  The fact that you have enormous shorts out there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  And I'm sure he is delighting tonight in fact that those shorts took  a huge hit. I've read the number, it's a pretty big number that they lost  because the stock going up 10 percent. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I don't -- you know, I can't recall having cover corporate  accounting, and corporate accounting, I'm not saying this is a scandal, I  just covered corporate accounting at the Wall Street Journal. I can't  recall a company making such a significant statement that moves the market  in such a material way by tweet. </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to wonder if the SEC is going to be taking a look. </p><p>PEEK:  Well, Harvey Pitt has already come out and said, you know, perhaps  this really wasn't legal. I suspect that because now--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Harvey Pitt ran the FCC. </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, former FCC head. I think it has now been judged that you can  make public announcements via Twitter or Facebook, but this is sort of  outrageous it seems to me in that the financing has not been lined up.  Apparently if someone CNBC or someone went out and talked to all the banks,  nobody is saying that they are behind what was it, $70 billion transaction. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wait a minute. If they did -- if he only had, well, it's a  significant stake at the Saudi Arabia wealth fund.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  Well, it's $2 million.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, yes, but it's a good presence to have in there  (Inaudible) other banks in. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  Sure. But--</p><p>MACDONALD:  But if there is no other bank funding there then he is going  to--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  Who knows, right? </p><p>MACDONALD:  -- he's in trouble, right?</p><p>PEEK:  We'll see. I mean, you know, I read some of the discourse that came  out after the earnings call, which was very bullish, if you remember. But  then, a couple days later, as is their want they held up 10 Q. The  financial report until after that earnings call.</p><p>And in that financial report there were some pretty troubling things about  the balance sheet, which is really at issue here for this company. They're  going to be -- they're saying they are going to be spending $2.5 billion a  year. Some analysts think that is simply not enough to cover their expected  capital and expenditures and interest payment. So I think there really are  some questions to Tesla's solvency. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. I mean, the debt swamp the shareholder equities.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes. And by the way, going private in some ways would be a good  thing for Tesla. No question. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. I tell you something. When you factor in Musk ownership  stake at around 90 percent, and the shorts at around 27, half of the  company is either owned by the shorts or Musk. I mean, holy Toledo, what a  story this is. </p><p>PEEK:  It is a big story. No question.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Liz, great to see you. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p>PEEK:  Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to your money. We really want to check what's going  on with the markets closing in green. The Dow up 126 points. Walt Disney  reporting a bit of disappointing third quarter. Studio revenue though, grew  20 percent year-over-year, with strong box office sales there.</p><p>Let's get right to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the NYSE with the  latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Immediately following the  numbers on Disney we saw Disney selling off, it missed on the estimates.  And while it did well enough in the movie studio, they have higher  programming cost, and the trend from ESPN continues losing subscribers  there. Watch Disney tomorrow in the trade. </p><p>In the meantime, the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P moved higher. The Dow up  127 points. And the S&amp;P 500 about half a percent away from its all-time  high. </p><p>It is worth noting that as for highs, notable highs, Disney hit a multiyear  high as did Pfizer and Merck. And guess what. Apple hit an all-time high  today as well. I know it pulled back but they are breaking out a little bit  testing the top. Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Thank you, Nicole. We're going to stay on the story  about billionaire Elon Musk, confirming his intention to go private via  tweet. Is this a brave new world for all investors that CEOs could tweet  out information that rocks the markets and change the value of their 401Ks?  We're staying on that story for you throughout the hour. </p><p>Also tonight, a video now going viral. Ivy League millennials trying to  explain what their understanding of the First Amendment is. It did not go  well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any come to mind freedom is under the First Amendment. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Freedom of-- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So at an average 60k a year in tuition what are professors  teaching their kids. We're going to play the full exchange, coming up. </p><p>Also tonight, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to try  to grab more government control of the internet. Judge Andrew Napolitano  says watch out, it's an attack in your First Amendment rights. He's here to  talk about it. </p><p>But first, voting now underway in five states. Bernie Sanders jumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed. He's looking to implement  a bunch of socialist policies in that state. We've got the details and the  debate, coming up. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Voting underway in five states today. Primaries in Kansas,  Michigan, Missouri and Washington. And we have a special House election in  Ohio's 12th district. This as socialist Bernie Sanders is stumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed.</p><p>He's looking to implement socialist policies like, state level single payer  healthcare, free college tuition, end the state's anti-union laws it's  called right to work.</p><p>Let's bring in Wall Street Journal editorial board member, look who's here,  Bill McGurn. You know, Bill, here's the thing with the socialist. I mean,  Alexandria Cortez won 16,000 of the vote.</p><p>WILLIAM MCGURN, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Bernie Sanders 13 million, But then they want to change the  entire U.S. economic system when they don't have a mandate or a majority. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. And also let's remember, there is a lot of enthusiasm with  Bernie, but there was a lot of enthusiasm in 2016, and he lost to Hillary  Clinton. Which who by all accounts was not the best candidate and so far  the most charismatic. </p><p>So there's -- you know, he may not be quite as popular. He may have a very  intense and dedicated following but it may not be a message that resonates  with a larger audience. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, they only have a fraction of the vote. Bernie Sanders  is 4 percent of the entire population. Cortez 16 -- Cynthia Nixon and  Cortez and Sanders, here's the thing with them, Bill. Do they know that the  Democrat socialist web site says the government will take control of the  energy and steel sectors and turn consumer goods companies like Kimberly- Clark or a Colgate Palmolive into co-op. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. Right. Look,--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Do they know that that's the cause--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCGURN:  You know the expression if you think things are expensive now,  wait until they are fray?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  That's kind of what we're getting. Look, Bernie Sanders his own  family, his wife manage to college, he talk about free tuition and branded  into the ground.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It's just it doesn't work. It's an odd argument to be making for  socialism now, when the economy is perking up, and I think people feel it.  I think people feel it in terms of not being trapped in their jobs. </p><p>I have a daughter just starting work out of college. You know, I feel  there's more opportunity. I think people really feel it. So it's an odd for  me to hear this message now. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I hear you. And you're paying a heck of a lot of tuition. </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes. Well, when I stop -- when I stop.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  You still feel that way, that's the point. You know, switching  gears. Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate David Garcia, proposed a  border policy, that is tailor-made for illegal immigrants to pour in over  the border. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GARCIA (D) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  I want to take just a  second and imagine. Just imagine, just imagine, no wall. No wall in  southern Arizona.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction.</p><p>MCGURN:  Yes. Lennonism. I mean, John Lennonism, right, in acting? I think  it's kind of silly. Look, I'm more on the pro-immigration side of them, I  have three daughters who are immigrants to this country, but I want a legal  system. </p><p>And I thought that President Trump might be vulnerable a little bit and not  having to deal with the DREAMers. But since the Democrats have moved to the  abolish ICE--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  He gives it a deal. But he had a deal and Democrats-- </p><p>MCGURN:  Right, but I think that might have been used against him. But when  people say abolishing ICE and so forth, it doesn't sound like a policy, it  just sounds ridiculous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You know, quickly, the Ohio district vote tonight, people  are saying this could be a referendum of the midterms.</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is that really true? </p><p>MCGURN:  Well, I mean, I think each race has to be fought individually, but  I think what's interesting about this race, is that I think its suburban  district. And so, what they're worried about for Republicans in suburban  districts, maybe Republican women, softer vote for the president. So it  could be a referendum that way in terms of the swing district. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, but that one a sliver of the voting population. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So it's really not an overall-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN:  No. But there are a lot of -- a lot of these swing districts are  up for grabs.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>MCGURN:  And the question is whether they go. The interesting thing is the  Republican have a pretty decent candidate there, he's backed by both Donald  Trump and Governor Kasich. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's interesting.</p><p>MCGURN:  That has to be the only thing the two men agree on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, exactly. We love having you on, Bill McGurn. </p><p>MCGURN:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  A video now going viral, Ivy League millennials trying to talk  about the First Amendment. Coming up, see if anyone was able to explain  what it is and what's that over pay college tuition is going towards,  that's a middle class family is at stake. </p><p>But first, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to push  for a dramatic and aggressive new plan for the government to -- for the  government to control what you see on the internet. </p><p>Next, Judge Andrew Napolitano he is going to say, this is an attack on  yours First Amendment right, after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Welcome back. Coming this September, Senate intelligence  will call in executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet, that's the  parent of Google, to testify. Now that's coming on September 5th about  foreign influence and more happening on their web site.</p><p>This as YouTube, Apple and Facebook did take down contents from info wars  and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy now  demanding tech companies go even further. Murphy is now taking heat and he  is getting heat for sounding like he wants to ban even more sites as well. </p><p>Quote, \"Info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies used site  like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do  more than take down one web site. The survival of our democracy depends on  it\" </p><p>And former Trump economic advisor Gary Cohen is now saying that the banks  were more responsible in 2008 during the crisis than Facebook is today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, look who's here, Judge  Andrew Napolitano. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Their remedy for hate  speech is more speech, it's not suppression of speech and it's not the  regulation of speech. </p><p>You may disagree with what Alex Jones said, but he has every right to say  it. Now having said that, these platforms are private, Google and Alphabet  and Facebook and Instagram, they're not owned by the government, the First  Amendment does not regulate them, they can kickoff anybody they want. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are they going to kick off Louis Farrakhan? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know if they can do it. Are they going to kick off  Rand Paul and the libertarian web sites that I go to? So here is the  dilemma. Allowing the private entities to kickoff political opinions with  which they disagree when the sanities are the three or four platforms that  everybody uses in the country versus the government regulating the enemies  or the entities -- I misspoken but that's already in -- regulating these  platforms, and telling them who they have to put on and what you have to do  to get-- </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. So that's the issue. I mean, your point  is well taken. They are private entities. They're allowed to ban whoever  they want. Alex Jones has been called pretty odious for what he believes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's got the right to believe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  People want to listen to it they can listen to it. The problem  is the barriers to entry, the economic barriers to entry are so great. In a  perfect world people that got banned and people that didn't like the people  that were banned would go to another platform, but there is no other  Facebook at least as far as I know. There's not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like big way -- OK. Senate Democrats, look at this, they're now  circulating plans for what they want as basically, being called a crackdown  of the internet. Force social media to verify the geographic location of  all of you in every -- and where you post. Also mandatory identity  verification, also let government researcher access user data, and make  social media legally liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and  disclosure of facts, your private facts. Your take on this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO Well, they should be liable for the negligent or intentional  disclosure of private facts, but they are bulletin board, they shouldn't be  liable for what people post on their bulletin board, the people who post it  should be liable. </p><p>And there are -- there are entities in the United States that will help you  find them if y have to sue them. But this thou shall register with us  before you can use us is outrageous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's all the government needs -- </p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... to be able to get into your iPhone online because we posted  something on Facebook. </p><p>MACDONALD: That's First Amendment right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course, it's also the Fourth Amendment, the right to  privacy.</p><p>MACDONALD: There you go. OK, switching gears. Boy, I love it when you come  at me like that. Switching gears, look at this, Campus Reform asks  millennials at Columbia University to name the five freedoms guaranteed by  First Amendment. </p><p>Now, you wonder where the $60,000 a year in tuition goes, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got $20 right here, if you can name all five. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No way I am naming all five. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any come to mind, freedoms under the First Amendment? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The right to a jury by your peers. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am done. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. I'm sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It involves what we're doing right now, all of us.  Assembled? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom of assembly, oh, like to do protests and stuff? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The judge is astonished. He's stunned here. You're shaking your  head.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I did this morning with Stuart Varney. I did not know  this was Columbia University, an Ivy League school. And they don't know the  First Amendment says. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of  speech or interfering with the free exercise of religion or right or  interfering with the right peaceably to assemble and seek redress of  grievances from the government.</p><p>MACDONALD: And petition the government. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: And petition the government. There is also one that the Supreme  Court said is there, which is not there in print. </p><p>MACDONALD: Religion. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: The opposite of speech, silence. </p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, silence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The government can't force speech. I wouldn't expect them to  know that, unless they studied constitutional law. But they should know. It  is an Ivy League school, they should know basically what their freedoms  are. </p><p>MACDONALD: It's astonishing. And you are rightfully shaking your head in  disgust. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's free money down the rat hole and burning. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: I was, but that mentality that the students betrayed...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... is being portrayed by Senator Coons and others that want to  interfere with speech by having the government regulate it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, can you come...</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm sure which is more dangerous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, this sounds like another segment for you to come on. We'll  have you on again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There you go. </p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Judge. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All the best.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're staying on this story for you because it is a shocker.  Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted out his intention to take Tesla private. That  shot the stock up 11 percent. So can a company do that? Coming up, we have  new details from letter he sent his workers. </p><p>But first, after a weekend of Antifa protests, a group are causing  conservatives -- Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a restaurant in  Philly yesterday, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones, he is fired  up. He is here to react, stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTORS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: A group of liberal protesters allegedly aligned with Antifa are  costing conservatives Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a Philadelphia  restaurant they were eating out yesterday. Now as soon as activists heard  that the two were there, they mobilized within an hour, chanting, yelling  vulgarity, blowing whistles in their faces, even throwing water. Police had  to step in for safety reasons. Let's take it up with conservative  commentator, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones. Great to see  you, Lawrence. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CAMPUS REFORM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Hey, Mac.  Well, I mean,  Liz, it is getting to a point where we really shouldn't be surprised. I  mean, this is a movement that has been out of control since UC Berkeley.  Yet, they are often put in positions where they are not arrested for their  radical behavior, they assault people. And then, us, conservatives and  libertarians are just supposed to sit back as they are a full blown  anarchist. When is enough is enough? </p><p>MACDONALD: OK, the Obamas said when we they go low, we go high. Then we  have Maxine Waters telling people to get in their faces. And now, this,  Lawrence, black and Hispanic police officers protected Charlie Kirk and  Candace Owens, but the liberals who showed up, they screamed F the racist  police, all police are racists. They called Candice Owens and the police  there race traitors. Your reaction?</p><p>JONES: Yeah. And I would like to know that the majority of people that are  talking about race traitors, and calling the cops racists, these are white,  you know, anarchists, members of Antifa. And so, this just shows you that  the left, Liz, this is all a political strategy for them. And I'm not sure  average American people are going to take this much longer. I don't care if  you like Candace or Charlie, they have a right to express whatever opinion  they want. </p><p>MACDONALD: You know, what's so poisonous is what is going on with liberal  left. Is the idea that you disagree with them, that is OK, and they are  allowed to call anybody a Nazi or a white supremacist? They called Candace  Owens a white supremacist. They were saying the same of the police officers  there, who keep them safe everyday. </p><p>JONES: Well, Liz, it's not just name-calling, people can say what they want  to say, but they start throwing, you know, fruit, and water. Honestly, a  lot of them, because I don't know how I would have responded, Liz, if  someone would have assaulted me just because of my political ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD: Has it happened to you, Lawrence? </p><p>JONES: No, but I'm 6'5\" and I'm from Texas. And we don't tolerate that. So  I can't imagine anybody ever trying to do that with me, Liz, to be honest  with you. </p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you come on the show and tell us if it happens, Lawrence  Jones. We love having you on. Thank you for your insights. </p><p>JONES: Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he jolted financial markets with  a tweet, saying he is considering taking Tesla private, some ballpark that  deal a potential 70 billion bucks. We want to get to the guy with the  information in this scoop. He breaks news all day long. He is Fox Business'  Charlie Gasparino, Charlie, wow, what a tweet. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS: Yeah. And it was bizarre what  happened before the tweet, what happened after the tweet. I mean, let's put  this in a little bit of context. Tesla is a very heavily shorted stock. You  know, it is fair to say that Elon Musk is at war with the shorts right now.  He has been lashing out at reporters, certain short sellers, claiming  conspiracy to drive down shares. It kind of stopped some of hemorrhaging of  the stock of late, they had better-than-expected -- recently better-than- expected quarter. And then, this is what happened today. </p><p>Stock was basically was heading you know somewhat down in the early  trading, if you take a look at the chart. Then a story leaked in Financial  Times that said -- that saw the sovereign wealth fund was going to buy  about 3 to 5 percent of Twitter shares. Stocks went up -- excuse me, Tesla  shares. And then -- and then, not long after, minutes later, comes this  tweet he is considering going public, in his disclosure -- he disclosed it  in a press release, he didn't disclose it on the PR Newswire. He disclosed  this on his own Twitter page. And stock, as you can see, took off. </p><p>So a lot of it is pretty unconventional stuff. There is a question whether  Elon Musk violated disclosure rules on his disclosure, through the tweet,  probably not. The other -- because he generally discloses stuff on Twitter.  And I think the company has said that, you know, pay attention to his  tweets if you want company news. So, that, they're probably OK on that. I  think what they might get some issues is on the -- just how this thing  leaked out about Saudi Wealth Fund. I mean, was that news which is  obviously peculiar to the stock, who leaked that and why. </p><p>And then, the other question is, Liz, I would say this -- I would say this,  I would say this. What he actually tweeted out, I am considering doing  this, I have funding secured, is all that accurate right now?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, that's the point, Charlie, because you have such great  sources, what if he only has Saudi Arabia stake and no bank saying yeah,  we'll fund it. By the way, Charlie, you make a good point about him and  that pitted battle with the shorts. Who knows if he is just tweeting out to  take out the shorts and create more dead shorts, right?</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, listen, the shorts are clearly -- I spoke with some of  them today, they are clearly saying that.  You know, Jim Chanos, who is a  legendary short seller (ph), basically a very fundamental oriented short  seller. He looks at numbers. He doesn't like tweet out rumors and  speculations. He short -- the shorts got killed today. There is no doubt  about that.</p><p>I think the real question is, and I am not casting aspersions on this, I'm  not saying this is not true, but if he did not have the financing secure  for taking it private -- because this is a big chunk of change...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: We are talking 70 to 80 billion, it depends on your estimates. I  have heard 80 billion being -- that would be, by far, I think the largest  LBO in history of LBOs, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, it might get the numbers -- it might get the numbers  right. </p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it sounds right. </p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, just check my numbers on this, but this is huge. If he  doesn't have the financing secured for this and he tweeted he did, well,  that's a problem. </p><p>MACDONALD: That means he was taking out shorts. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: It means he is not -- he is releasing stuff for the investing  public that is not accurate.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's the problem. </p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Charlie. Great stuff there. Come back on soon.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. </p><p>MACDONALD: We love having you on. Now, look at this story, a new high  sensitivity blood test may be able to pick up whether or not you are going  to have a heart attack, faster -- and faster and more accurately  potentially than the existing test. Dr. Siegel is here on that and what it  means for you. </p><p>But we're going to take on Alexandria Cortez again, we've got new stuff,  new debate, what is she saying today? You won't believe what she said  today. My panel takes its on next, stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: ... of the last, there has  been there reluctance to say, oh, don't moralize the issues. And I push  back on that, because -- like, we are in a time of right and wrong. </p><p>The issues of today are all moral, right to healthcare is a moral issue,  the idea that we have largest population of homeless people since Great  Depression in New York City, is a moral issue. The fact that there are  three empty luxury apartments for every one person experiencing  homelessness is a moral issue. The fact that kids are going into trailers  in back of their schools to get an education, because we won't guild  schools is a moral issue. All of these things are moral decisions.</p><p>We need to take this moment, and we have to -- we really do need to claim  the moral high ground. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You've got that right. She is making important point, Alexandria  Cortez about the problems out there and how a lot of them are moral issues.  But then, she is saying basically, I am going to take a moral high ground.  So, here is the problem. Will all of her policy ideas be morally right?  Let's take it up with the political panel, Republican strategist Ford  O'Connell, and Democrat strategist Raj Goyle. So, everything she is going  to do is going to be moral? Ford, is that -- is that what is happening?</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Oh, yes. And that's absolutely the  case, because that's the only way you can sell Medicare for all, free jobs,  free housing, free college education, because these policies, as history  teaches you, ignore modern history, basic math, and rise of oppressive  regimes. When we talk about socialism, E-Mac, you and I hear Venezuela, the  USSR, very bad folks. Well, today's millenials basically hear is what she  is talking about, which is Canada, Switzerland, affordable housing,  affordable college. It's the difference between what we know and what  millenials hear. And that's why it is gaining traction.</p><p>MACDONALD: Cortez is also complaining, Raj, about prosperity. But socialism  didn't make this country prosperous, it was capitalism. And on the  Democratic socialists' website, it says that the government will control  energy and the steel sectors, and also the consumer good sector. That's  what the Democratic socialists want.</p><p>RAJ GOYLE, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Yeah, well, I have to say it is just a  little bit ironic for somebody from the Republican Party to suddenly say  that morality does not have a role...</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Well, what about what I'm talking about? </p><p>GOYLE: The reality is that actually these issues that she is talking about,  I think I agree with Ford on notion that the younger people in America, the  people who are hurting a lot of Trump base, the same base that actually  voted for Bernie Sanders, when he almost won the Democratic primary...</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you going to answer my question about what I just said about  government controlling the whole sectors of the economy. </p><p>GOYLE: Yeah. Look, everybody is a capitalist. We know that. She said that.  And it is a nice...</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: She is. She absolutely is.</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: Here is the actual issue. </p><p>MACDONALD: Why do you think -- hang on. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Ford, stay there. Wait a second. Ford, Ford, why do we think  she is a capitalist?</p><p>O'CONNELL: We don't think that she is a capitalist. And frankly, she is  actually dragging rest of Democratic Party down with her. Look at what she  said about unemployment. The reason why unemployment is low is because  people working two or three jobs. Within five minutes later, Elizabeth  Warren said it is actually because they are working four or five jobs. The  bottom-line is she not a capitalist. What they are looking for is they are  looking to retake power, they're looking to play on people's emotions. And  they're willing to do anything...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Hold on a second.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: One second, one second, one second.</p><p>GOYLE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>MACDONALD: The point that she is making are good ones. </p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely. </p><p>MACDONALD: There are people suffering out there. </p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: Hang on. We're talking about the solutions that work. And the  solutions there have failed in countries around the world. </p><p>GOYLE: The people in this country -- look, I represent a very red district  in the reddest part of the red estate state in this country. I knock on  15,000 doors. My former constituents, now a Trump district, would have  agreed with notion that we need change. And that's why Donald Trump got  elected. He was a change candidate. But the issues, and the reason that I  agree with Ford is that the Republican Party is in absolute meltdown right  now. The only person who has lost a major national election in this cycle  because was he an extremist (ph) is Roy Moore in Alabama. </p><p>O'CONNELL: He was also pedophile, to be honest. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOYLE: ... who is nominated and the leader of the Republican Party  supported him. Why in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, Liz, is the Republican  Party not even competing because...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL: ... in 2005. It is absolutely ridiculous to say we lost the  Virginia race because somehow we could actually compete. Yeah, we could win  now and then in Virginia. In Alabama, guess what, we needed a senate seat  and he didn't back...</p><p>MACDONALD: He put one away.</p><p>O'CONNELL: He backed my former client, Luther Strange, who actually lost. </p><p>MACDONALD: Just hang on a second, we used a harsh term that we can't use on  this network, pedophile, OK? </p><p>O'CONNELL: Sorry about that, my apologies.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's OK. Understood.  Well, we got one more minute to go. I  don't understand why you're saying she is a capitalist because she is not a  capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: Look, I get -- I get what the objective here is, which is we need a  liberal punching back because...</p><p>MACDONALD: No, no, you are not. I'm sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Excuse me, Raj, Raj, you are not answering -- you're not  answering the question of why you claimed she is a capitalist. We got to  have to leave it there. Ford and Raj, thank you so much. I really  appreciate it.</p><p>O'CONNELL: Ty, E-Mac.</p><p>GOYLE: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, we have a healthcare game-changer, carmaker GM working out  a deal with a local hospital group, instead of dealing with insurers. GM  saying it's a good thing. We got it coming up. Doc Siegel on that after the  break.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, look at this healthcare game-changer. Carmaker GM  designing to offer a healthcare plan for workers. To break it down, Doc  Siegel is here. Well, this is a big deal, Doc.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX BUSINESS: I like this. </p><p>MACDONALD: Why?</p><p>SIEGEL: You know why, it cuts out the middleman, it cuts down costs. The  average is going to be $300 to $900 in premiums less. They are starting it  out with 24,000 employees, but we know General Motors has 180,000  employees. And guess what they're using, Liz, the Henry Ford Healthcare  System in Detroit. How ironic, General Motors going to Henry Ford Hospital.  It's a very good hospital. They're going to be able to get next-day  service. They're going to have access to 3,000 healthcare providers. You're  going to get surgery. It's going to be all in one place. And you know what,  prescription drug prices will be less because again, pharmacy benefit  managers step in and take a profit for negotiating a deal. General Motors  has the power behind it that they can negotiate directly with healthcare  providers, lower costs and lower prices. </p><p>MACDONALD: OK, so, GM is handling it. How are they going to protect them  bottom-line by doing it this way.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think they're going to do that because it is going to cut out  waste. So the bottom-line will be -- will be better, though actually not  waste money. So, again, the money doesn't get chewed up by GM. It gets  chewed up the middleman.</p><p>MACDONALD: You like this. It sounds you really like this.</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, Boeing is doing it. And Intel is doing it. And 11 percent of  all employers are doing it. Everybody knows that the money in the  healthcare system is not lost with the doctor or the patient or even the  employer. It's lost with the insurance companies and with the pharmacy  benefit managers.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow, what a story. Can you come back on and we'll talk more  about it?</p><p>SIEGEL: I'm very excited about this. It is a private way to cut down  healthcare cost.</p><p>MACDONALD: Doc Siegel, we love having you on.</p><p>SIEGEL: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Come back soon. We're going to have more after the break, stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Breaking news, the Trump White House set to impose  a second set of tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese imports starting  August 23rd. That's just two weeks away. We're going to stay on that story  for you.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for having us in your homes. Thank you for  watching.

EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We're intending to  put unprecedented pressure on Iran. Their currency is going through the  floor, much of that in the past 90 days. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Trump appears to be threatening any country that does  business with Iran by blowing up the Iran deal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In the spring, we lost the support we had, which was  hard to achieve from Russia and China, and obviously the E.U. </p><p>BOLTON:  Why do you want to do business with the world's largest financier  of international terrorism? Really, the central bank of international  terrorism. Do your shareholders feel good that you are doing business with  a terrorist regime, that's the sort of thing I think everybody needs to  ask. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX NEWS HOST:  And the pressure is now on. President  Trump warning European countries -- companies, you do business with Iran,  you will not be doing business with the United States.</p><p>Now look at this. German carmaker Daimler did changed its expansion plans  in Iran. So who is next to fall in line? We've got the names coming up. And  you will not believe which European country is now stepping up. </p><p>And Iran's President Hassan Rouhani saying Iran cannot negotiate with U.S.  while under sanctions. Accusing the U.S. of, quote, \"psychological  warfare.\" We debate that. </p><p>And coming up too, the latest on conservatives getting assaulted in public. </p><p>And also this, Tesla stock halted in trading today after billionaire,  speaking of Elon Musk, he tweeted out that he may take Tesla's private. It  was a tweet heard around the world. We've got the latest on that, and also  Disney earnings and more.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>All right. Let's get right to your money. Look at this. The Dow finishing  up 126 points to 25,628. It's sleepy August, the Dow continues to go up.  The S&amp;P climbing to less than 1 percent from a new record. Tesla and Amazon  on the move. More on your money in just a second.</p><p>But first, President Trump sanctions on Iran went into effect today, and  businesses from Berlin, Paris, Rome to London now feeling pressure to back  off from doing business in Iran. </p><p>And Germany is the country now stepping up and reportedly moving to stop  the transfer of nearly $400 million in cash out of Germany to the Iranian  regime. Iran wants its money. They want that 400 million now. To avoid that  money being detained under looming sanctions.</p><p>While U.S. sanctions were also causing German auto giant Daimler, the maker  of Mercedes, to abandon their expansion plans in Iran. Look at this. The  maker of Peugeot cars, also the French oil company Total, and Germany's  Siemens have also backed off. </p><p>A U.S. official now says nearly 100 international firms have announced they  intend to leave Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also calling out to  European companies saying it is time to make a choice. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  What is it about the ayatollah  that you like? Why do you stand with him and against the people he is  oppressing? Why do you want to give a man more money who's taken the money  you've already given him to build the war machine to dismember the Mideast.</p><p>Do you think he is kidding when he says death to Israel? To the Europeans,  you need to get with the Iranian people, and get behind Trump to break this  regime's back before it is too late.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, we welcome to the show, former U.S. Army  Special Forces, and Security Studies Group president, Jim Hanson. Great to  see you, Jim. So, the threat of being cut off from the U.S. financial  system is it enough for European companies to say you know what, we're not  going to help Iran with its major exports of Islamic revolution, right? </p><p>JIM HANSON, PRESIDENT, SECURITY STUDIES GROUP:  I don't think it's a tough  question from a business perspective when you look at the size of the  economy in Iran and the size of the economy in the United States. So that's  an easy case to make. </p><p>You add on top of that, the fact that Iran is the most malevolent force in  the region, they sponsor terror all over the place and they're oppressing  their own people, stealing their wealth. I don't think it's something that  any decent country should be able to countenance. And right now, they seem  to be stepping in line and that's good. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Jim, it looks like we're in a hinge point right now.  And interesting development. Europe was thought to be saying to Iran we  will still work with you on a nuclear deal. </p><p>But now this, Germany, we know that Germany is Europe's economic engine.  The fact that, Jim, it's reportedly moving to stop Iran from getting $400  million in cash out of Germany is significant because Germany's central  bank often partnered with Iran to circumvent U.S. sanctions. </p><p>HANSON:  And now you've got a 100 percent clear message coming out of the  U.S. administration. President Trump said, do business with them, don't do  be with us. John Bolton said, don't buy their oil, stop buying playing with  the mullahs. It's crystal clear. And it's fair. </p><p>You know, the mullahs have stolen when Obama sent all that cash over on  planes, the Iranian people thought maybe they may get a little bit of win  fall from that. Instead it all was stolen by the mullahs or sent to Hamas  and Hezbollah and other terror groups.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And--</p><p>HANSON:  So it's time to change that around and use the money for good. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And Jim, it seems like the Iranian people are saying to Europe,  stand with us, and not those oppressing us. They seems to be saying to the  Democrats and liberal left here in the United States, you, liberal left and  Democrats, stand with the people in the streets of Iran and not those  oppressing us. </p><p>We have President Hassan Rouhani he is now saying Iran cannot talk to the  U.S. while under sanctions. Let's a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator):  What's the meaning  of negotiations when you impose sanctions at the same time? It's like  someone pulling a knife, stab a rival or an enemy in the arms, while at the  same time claiming we should be talking and negotiating. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction, Jim? </p><p>HANSON:  Come on, Rouhani is a thug, and the bottom line is we don't have a  whole lot to talk to him about. You are absolutely right saying that all  decent people should be standing with the citizens of Iran, the people who  want decent governing. They want to stop being, you have their money stolen  and used for terrorism as opposed to giving them a decent standard of  living.</p><p>So I think now that people are actually looking at that and saying, well,  why would we stand? You know, the Obama administration decided that the  Iranians were a partner for peace. They were wrong, now that reality has  set back in, we can go ahead and flip that on its head and the mullahs need  to suffer, not the people of Iran. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jim, we also have Trump national security advisor John Bolton  explaining what it would take for a deal with Iran. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  The policy is not regime change, but we definitely want to put  maximum pressure on the government. </p><p>We want to see a much broader retreat by Iran from their support for  international terrorism, their belligerent military activity in the Middle  East, and their ballistic missile nuclear related programs. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Here's a bit of a disconnect. The White House is  saying it will go after and shut down Iran's oil exports but then it says  it's not about regime change. Can you spell that for us? </p><p>HANSON:  I think the correct policy is the one that John Bolton just  outlined, we want the mullahs to change their malevolent ways. If they  don't do that, who knows what the next step is, you know, it could be that  they are replaced either by the people of Iran or by the simple fact that  they end up bankrupt and unable to maintain their corrupt regime.</p><p>So, I don't think it's a question of the U.S. saying we think everyone  there should change the regime. That's the Iranian people's choice. We just  support their right to a decent government. And that's the right way for  the U.S. to operate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jim Hanson, president of Security Studies Group. Great to see  you, Jim. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>HANSON:  Good to be with you, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to job. Job gains in the manufacturing sector, in the  last 12 months, the most since 1995. </p><p>And look at this. As the president is moving to retrain our work force and  get better education, we have former education secretary under President  Obama, he is Arne Duncan, he criticize President Trump. Take a listen to  what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ARNE DUNCAN, FORMER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:  I'm not sure  President Trump wants to have the best educated workforce. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why is that? </p><p>DUNCAN:  I think it doesn't play to his authoritarian tendencies. He don't  want highly educated people challenging his thinking. He is trying to call  the press the enemy of the people. He is trying to suppress trust in  institutions. Having thoughtful people who think on themselves -- think by  themselves think critically. I'm not sure if that's in his self interest. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, we welcome to the show for her reaction from the Fiscal  Times star columnist, Liz Peek. Great to see you. Your reaction to that? </p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES:  I think that's an appalling statement.  And I have to say if any group could be accused of not wanting to educate  the people, it's Democrats who basically are all in with the teacher's  union oppose every kind of reform, come out as Hillary Clinton did and the  ACP did against charter schools which in some cities like our own in  Baltimore and other places is the only ticket for kids who are living in  ghettos.</p><p>I mean, this is really -- and actually I'm really shocked by Arne Duncan  because he was a school reformer if you remember in Chicago. Obama had  hired him to be his education chief, and it wasn't until lead up to the  2012 election, when the teacher's union say, hey, you stop with these  reforms or we're not going to back you, then he backed off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And he said, Arne Duncan said that President Trump wants to  keep the American population uneducated and ignorant because he's  authoritarian. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  That is an appalling -- yes, that's an appalling statement. And  look, what is Trump actually doing? He's brought in Betsy DeVos, who is  trying to further other avenues to education for kids that really need a  leg up and haven't been able to get it through our public education system. </p><p>And more importantly, and I think very enthusiastically going after  apprenticeships, which is all to do with educating the workforce and  getting the people in a position where they can get jobs and make a living.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  And learn a trade.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's turn to this tweet that was heard around the world.  Billionaire Elon Musk rocking the markets today, he basically said he wants  to take Tesla private. </p><p>The shares are halted at about 367 a share, they did resumed trading. Musk  saying he, again, wants to take this company, Tesla private. Now Tesla  shares also jumping on a report that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund  bought a $2 billion minority stake in Tesla just below 5 percent.</p><p>Here is Musk's tweet. \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at four -- 420  bucks. Funding secured.\" </p><p>Later company issued a blog post saying no final decision has been made on  this. Musk clarifying in another tweet. \"Investor support is confirmed. The  only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on shareholder  vote.\" </p><p>Look at the stock, surging more than 10 percent after the trading resume,  closing out the day at 379 and change. </p><p>Liz, quite a development. Tesla going private. </p><p>PEEK:  I mean, it's really kind of unheard of for a CEO to tweet a $70  billion transaction, but then a lot of things that this fellow does are  pretty unusual including having to apologize on the latest on earnings call  for bad manners. </p><p>I have to say, reading the blog post in which he enumerates the reasons for  maybe wanting to go private, you kind of end up thinking he is a little bit  of a brat, right? In other words, what's really bothering him, the  scrutiny, the criticism.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Sure.</p><p>PEEK:  The fact that you have enormous shorts out there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  And I'm sure he is delighting tonight in fact that those shorts took  a huge hit. I've read the number, it's a pretty big number that they lost  because the stock going up 10 percent. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I don't -- you know, I can't recall having cover corporate  accounting, and corporate accounting, I'm not saying this is a scandal, I  just covered corporate accounting at the Wall Street Journal. I can't  recall a company making such a significant statement that moves the market  in such a material way by tweet. </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to wonder if the SEC is going to be taking a look. </p><p>PEEK:  Well, Harvey Pitt has already come out and said, you know, perhaps  this really wasn't legal. I suspect that because now--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Harvey Pitt ran the FCC. </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, former FCC head. I think it has now been judged that you can  make public announcements via Twitter or Facebook, but this is sort of  outrageous it seems to me in that the financing has not been lined up.  Apparently if someone CNBC or someone went out and talked to all the banks,  nobody is saying that they are behind what was it, $70 billion transaction. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wait a minute. If they did -- if he only had, well, it's a  significant stake at the Saudi Arabia wealth fund.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  Well, it's $2 million.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, yes, but it's a good presence to have in there  (Inaudible) other banks in. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK:  Sure. But--</p><p>MACDONALD:  But if there is no other bank funding there then he is going  to--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  Who knows, right? </p><p>MACDONALD:  -- he's in trouble, right?</p><p>PEEK:  We'll see. I mean, you know, I read some of the discourse that came  out after the earnings call, which was very bullish, if you remember. But  then, a couple days later, as is their want they held up 10 Q. The  financial report until after that earnings call.</p><p>And in that financial report there were some pretty troubling things about  the balance sheet, which is really at issue here for this company. They're  going to be -- they're saying they are going to be spending $2.5 billion a  year. Some analysts think that is simply not enough to cover their expected  capital and expenditures and interest payment. So I think there really are  some questions to Tesla's solvency. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. I mean, the debt swamp the shareholder equities.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes. And by the way, going private in some ways would be a good  thing for Tesla. No question. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. I tell you something. When you factor in Musk ownership  stake at around 90 percent, and the shorts at around 27, half of the  company is either owned by the shorts or Musk. I mean, holy Toledo, what a  story this is. </p><p>PEEK:  It is a big story. No question.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Liz, great to see you. Come back soon. We love having you on.</p><p>PEEK:  Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to your money. We really want to check what's going  on with the markets closing in green. The Dow up 126 points. Walt Disney  reporting a bit of disappointing third quarter. Studio revenue though, grew  20 percent year-over-year, with strong box office sales there.</p><p>Let's get right to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the NYSE with the  latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Immediately following the  numbers on Disney we saw Disney selling off, it missed on the estimates.  And while it did well enough in the movie studio, they have higher  programming cost, and the trend from ESPN continues losing subscribers  there. Watch Disney tomorrow in the trade. </p><p>In the meantime, the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P moved higher. The Dow up  127 points. And the S&amp;P 500 about half a percent away from its all-time  high. </p><p>It is worth noting that as for highs, notable highs, Disney hit a multiyear  high as did Pfizer and Merck. And guess what. Apple hit an all-time high  today as well. I know it pulled back but they are breaking out a little bit  testing the top. Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Thank you, Nicole. We're going to stay on the story  about billionaire Elon Musk, confirming his intention to go private via  tweet. Is this a brave new world for all investors that CEOs could tweet  out information that rocks the markets and change the value of their 401Ks?  We're staying on that story for you throughout the hour. </p><p>Also tonight, a video now going viral. Ivy League millennials trying to  explain what their understanding of the First Amendment is. It did not go  well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any come to mind freedom is under the First Amendment. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Freedom of-- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So at an average 60k a year in tuition what are professors  teaching their kids. We're going to play the full exchange, coming up. </p><p>Also tonight, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to try  to grab more government control of the internet. Judge Andrew Napolitano  says watch out, it's an attack in your First Amendment rights. He's here to  talk about it. </p><p>But first, voting now underway in five states. Bernie Sanders jumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed. He's looking to implement  a bunch of socialist policies in that state. We've got the details and the  debate, coming up. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Voting underway in five states today. Primaries in Kansas,  Michigan, Missouri and Washington. And we have a special House election in  Ohio's 12th district. This as socialist Bernie Sanders is stumping for a  Michigan gubernatorial candidate, Abdul El-Sayed.</p><p>He's looking to implement socialist policies like, state level single payer  healthcare, free college tuition, end the state's anti-union laws it's  called right to work.</p><p>Let's bring in Wall Street Journal editorial board member, look who's here,  Bill McGurn. You know, Bill, here's the thing with the socialist. I mean,  Alexandria Cortez won 16,000 of the vote.</p><p>WILLIAM MCGURN, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Bernie Sanders 13 million, But then they want to change the  entire U.S. economic system when they don't have a mandate or a majority. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. And also let's remember, there is a lot of enthusiasm with  Bernie, but there was a lot of enthusiasm in 2016, and he lost to Hillary  Clinton. Which who by all accounts was not the best candidate and so far  the most charismatic. </p><p>So there's -- you know, he may not be quite as popular. He may have a very  intense and dedicated following but it may not be a message that resonates  with a larger audience. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, they only have a fraction of the vote. Bernie Sanders  is 4 percent of the entire population. Cortez 16 -- Cynthia Nixon and  Cortez and Sanders, here's the thing with them, Bill. Do they know that the  Democrat socialist web site says the government will take control of the  energy and steel sectors and turn consumer goods companies like Kimberly- Clark or a Colgate Palmolive into co-op. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. Right. Look,--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Do they know that that's the cause--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCGURN:  You know the expression if you think things are expensive now,  wait until they are fray?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  That's kind of what we're getting. Look, Bernie Sanders his own  family, his wife manage to college, he talk about free tuition and branded  into the ground.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It's just it doesn't work. It's an odd argument to be making for  socialism now, when the economy is perking up, and I think people feel it.  I think people feel it in terms of not being trapped in their jobs. </p><p>I have a daughter just starting work out of college. You know, I feel  there's more opportunity. I think people really feel it. So it's an odd for  me to hear this message now. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I hear you. And you're paying a heck of a lot of tuition. </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes. Well, when I stop -- when I stop.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  You still feel that way, that's the point. You know, switching  gears. Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate David Garcia, proposed a  border policy, that is tailor-made for illegal immigrants to pour in over  the border. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GARCIA (D) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  I want to take just a  second and imagine. Just imagine, just imagine, no wall. No wall in  southern Arizona.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Your reaction.</p><p>MCGURN:  Yes. Lennonism. I mean, John Lennonism, right, in acting? I think  it's kind of silly. Look, I'm more on the pro-immigration side of them, I  have three daughters who are immigrants to this country, but I want a legal  system. </p><p>And I thought that President Trump might be vulnerable a little bit and not  having to deal with the DREAMers. But since the Democrats have moved to the  abolish ICE--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  He gives it a deal. But he had a deal and Democrats-- </p><p>MCGURN:  Right, but I think that might have been used against him. But when  people say abolishing ICE and so forth, it doesn't sound like a policy, it  just sounds ridiculous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You know, quickly, the Ohio district vote tonight, people  are saying this could be a referendum of the midterms.</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is that really true? </p><p>MCGURN:  Well, I mean, I think each race has to be fought individually, but  I think what's interesting about this race, is that I think its suburban  district. And so, what they're worried about for Republicans in suburban  districts, maybe Republican women, softer vote for the president. So it  could be a referendum that way in terms of the swing district. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, but that one a sliver of the voting population. </p><p>MCGURN:  Right. Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So it's really not an overall-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN:  No. But there are a lot of -- a lot of these swing districts are  up for grabs.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>MCGURN:  And the question is whether they go. The interesting thing is the  Republican have a pretty decent candidate there, he's backed by both Donald  Trump and Governor Kasich. </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's interesting.</p><p>MCGURN:  That has to be the only thing the two men agree on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, exactly. We love having you on, Bill McGurn. </p><p>MCGURN:  Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  A video now going viral, Ivy League millennials trying to talk  about the First Amendment. Coming up, see if anyone was able to explain  what it is and what's that over pay college tuition is going towards,  that's a middle class family is at stake. </p><p>But first, a new report, Democrats using the fake news crackdown to push  for a dramatic and aggressive new plan for the government to -- for the  government to control what you see on the internet. </p><p>Next, Judge Andrew Napolitano he is going to say, this is an attack on  yours First Amendment right, after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Welcome back. Coming this September, Senate intelligence  will call in executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet, that's the  parent of Google, to testify. Now that's coming on September 5th about  foreign influence and more happening on their web site.</p><p>This as YouTube, Apple and Facebook did take down contents from info wars  and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy now  demanding tech companies go even further. Murphy is now taking heat and he  is getting heat for sounding like he wants to ban even more sites as well. </p><p>Quote, \"Info wars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies used site  like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do  more than take down one web site. The survival of our democracy depends on  it\" </p><p>And former Trump economic advisor Gary Cohen is now saying that the banks  were more responsible in 2008 during the crisis than Facebook is today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, look who's here, Judge  Andrew Napolitano. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Their remedy for hate  speech is more speech, it's not suppression of speech and it's not the  regulation of speech. </p><p>You may disagree with what Alex Jones said, but he has every right to say  it. Now having said that, these platforms are private, Google and Alphabet  and Facebook and Instagram, they're not owned by the government, the First  Amendment does not regulate them, they can kickoff anybody they want. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are they going to kick off Louis Farrakhan? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know if they can do it. Are they going to kick off  Rand Paul and the libertarian web sites that I go to? So here is the  dilemma. Allowing the private entities to kickoff political opinions with  which they disagree when the sanities are the three or four platforms that  everybody uses in the country versus the government regulating the enemies  or the entities -- I misspoken but that's already in -- regulating these  platforms, and telling them who they have to put on and what you have to do  to get-- </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. So that's the issue. I mean, your point  is well taken. They are private entities. They're allowed to ban whoever  they want. Alex Jones has been called pretty odious for what he believes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's got the right to believe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  People want to listen to it they can listen to it. The problem  is the barriers to entry, the economic barriers to entry are so great. In a  perfect world people that got banned and people that didn't like the people  that were banned would go to another platform, but there is no other  Facebook at least as far as I know. There's not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like big way -- OK. Senate Democrats, look at this, they're now  circulating plans for what they want as basically, being called a crackdown  of the internet. Force social media to verify the geographic location of  all of you in every -- and where you post. Also mandatory identity  verification, also let government researcher access user data, and make  social media legally liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and  disclosure of facts, your private facts. Your take on this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO Well, they should be liable for the negligent or intentional  disclosure of private facts, but they are bulletin board, they shouldn't be  liable for what people post on their bulletin board, the people who post it  should be liable. </p><p>And there are -- there are entities in the United States that will help you  find them if y have to sue them. But this thou shall register with us  before you can use us is outrageous. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's all the government needs -- </p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... to be able to get into your iPhone online because we posted  something on Facebook. </p><p>MACDONALD: That's First Amendment right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course, it's also the Fourth Amendment, the right to  privacy.</p><p>MACDONALD: There you go. OK, switching gears. Boy, I love it when you come  at me like that. Switching gears, look at this, Campus Reform asks  millennials at Columbia University to name the five freedoms guaranteed by  First Amendment. </p><p>Now, you wonder where the $60,000 a year in tuition goes, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got $20 right here, if you can name all five. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No way I am naming all five. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any come to mind, freedoms under the First Amendment? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no idea. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The right to a jury by your peers. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am done. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. I'm sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It involves what we're doing right now, all of us.  Assembled? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom of assembly, oh, like to do protests and stuff? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The judge is astonished. He's stunned here. You're shaking your  head.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, I did this morning with Stuart Varney. I did not know  this was Columbia University, an Ivy League school. And they don't know the  First Amendment says. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of  speech or interfering with the free exercise of religion or right or  interfering with the right peaceably to assemble and seek redress of  grievances from the government.</p><p>MACDONALD: And petition the government. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: And petition the government. There is also one that the Supreme  Court said is there, which is not there in print. </p><p>MACDONALD: Religion. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: The opposite of speech, silence. </p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, silence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The government can't force speech. I wouldn't expect them to  know that, unless they studied constitutional law. But they should know. It  is an Ivy League school, they should know basically what their freedoms  are. </p><p>MACDONALD: It's astonishing. And you are rightfully shaking your head in  disgust. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's free money down the rat hole and burning. </p><p>NAPOLITANO: I was, but that mentality that the students betrayed...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... is being portrayed by Senator Coons and others that want to  interfere with speech by having the government regulate it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, can you come...</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm sure which is more dangerous.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, this sounds like another segment for you to come on. We'll  have you on again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There you go. </p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Judge. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All the best.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're staying on this story for you because it is a shocker.  Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted out his intention to take Tesla private. That  shot the stock up 11 percent. So can a company do that? Coming up, we have  new details from letter he sent his workers. </p><p>But first, after a weekend of Antifa protests, a group are causing  conservatives -- Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a restaurant in  Philly yesterday, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones, he is fired  up. He is here to react, stay there.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD PROTESTORS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: A group of liberal protesters allegedly aligned with Antifa are  costing conservatives Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens outside a Philadelphia  restaurant they were eating out yesterday. Now as soon as activists heard  that the two were there, they mobilized within an hour, chanting, yelling  vulgarity, blowing whistles in their faces, even throwing water. Police had  to step in for safety reasons. Let's take it up with conservative  commentator, Campus Reform editor-in-chief Lawrence Jones. Great to see  you, Lawrence. Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, CAMPUS REFORM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Hey, Mac.  Well, I mean,  Liz, it is getting to a point where we really shouldn't be surprised. I  mean, this is a movement that has been out of control since UC Berkeley.  Yet, they are often put in positions where they are not arrested for their  radical behavior, they assault people. And then, us, conservatives and  libertarians are just supposed to sit back as they are a full blown  anarchist. When is enough is enough? </p><p>MACDONALD: OK, the Obamas said when we they go low, we go high. Then we  have Maxine Waters telling people to get in their faces. And now, this,  Lawrence, black and Hispanic police officers protected Charlie Kirk and  Candace Owens, but the liberals who showed up, they screamed F the racist  police, all police are racists. They called Candice Owens and the police  there race traitors. Your reaction?</p><p>JONES: Yeah. And I would like to know that the majority of people that are  talking about race traitors, and calling the cops racists, these are white,  you know, anarchists, members of Antifa. And so, this just shows you that  the left, Liz, this is all a political strategy for them. And I'm not sure  average American people are going to take this much longer. I don't care if  you like Candace or Charlie, they have a right to express whatever opinion  they want. </p><p>MACDONALD: You know, what's so poisonous is what is going on with liberal  left. Is the idea that you disagree with them, that is OK, and they are  allowed to call anybody a Nazi or a white supremacist? They called Candace  Owens a white supremacist. They were saying the same of the police officers  there, who keep them safe everyday. </p><p>JONES: Well, Liz, it's not just name-calling, people can say what they want  to say, but they start throwing, you know, fruit, and water. Honestly, a  lot of them, because I don't know how I would have responded, Liz, if  someone would have assaulted me just because of my political ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD: Has it happened to you, Lawrence? </p><p>JONES: No, but I'm 6'5\" and I'm from Texas. And we don't tolerate that. So  I can't imagine anybody ever trying to do that with me, Liz, to be honest  with you. </p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you come on the show and tell us if it happens, Lawrence  Jones. We love having you on. Thank you for your insights. </p><p>JONES: Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he jolted financial markets with  a tweet, saying he is considering taking Tesla private, some ballpark that  deal a potential 70 billion bucks. We want to get to the guy with the  information in this scoop. He breaks news all day long. He is Fox Business'  Charlie Gasparino, Charlie, wow, what a tweet. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS: Yeah. And it was bizarre what  happened before the tweet, what happened after the tweet. I mean, let's put  this in a little bit of context. Tesla is a very heavily shorted stock. You  know, it is fair to say that Elon Musk is at war with the shorts right now.  He has been lashing out at reporters, certain short sellers, claiming  conspiracy to drive down shares. It kind of stopped some of hemorrhaging of  the stock of late, they had better-than-expected -- recently better-than- expected quarter. And then, this is what happened today. </p><p>Stock was basically was heading you know somewhat down in the early  trading, if you take a look at the chart. Then a story leaked in Financial  Times that said -- that saw the sovereign wealth fund was going to buy  about 3 to 5 percent of Twitter shares. Stocks went up -- excuse me, Tesla  shares. And then -- and then, not long after, minutes later, comes this  tweet he is considering going public, in his disclosure -- he disclosed it  in a press release, he didn't disclose it on the PR Newswire. He disclosed  this on his own Twitter page. And stock, as you can see, took off. </p><p>So a lot of it is pretty unconventional stuff. There is a question whether  Elon Musk violated disclosure rules on his disclosure, through the tweet,  probably not. The other -- because he generally discloses stuff on Twitter.  And I think the company has said that, you know, pay attention to his  tweets if you want company news. So, that, they're probably OK on that. I  think what they might get some issues is on the -- just how this thing  leaked out about Saudi Wealth Fund. I mean, was that news which is  obviously peculiar to the stock, who leaked that and why. </p><p>And then, the other question is, Liz, I would say this -- I would say this,  I would say this. What he actually tweeted out, I am considering doing  this, I have funding secured, is all that accurate right now?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, that's the point, Charlie, because you have such great  sources, what if he only has Saudi Arabia stake and no bank saying yeah,  we'll fund it. By the way, Charlie, you make a good point about him and  that pitted battle with the shorts. Who knows if he is just tweeting out to  take out the shorts and create more dead shorts, right?</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, listen, the shorts are clearly -- I spoke with some of  them today, they are clearly saying that.  You know, Jim Chanos, who is a  legendary short seller (ph), basically a very fundamental oriented short  seller. He looks at numbers. He doesn't like tweet out rumors and  speculations. He short -- the shorts got killed today. There is no doubt  about that.</p><p>I think the real question is, and I am not casting aspersions on this, I'm  not saying this is not true, but if he did not have the financing secure  for taking it private -- because this is a big chunk of change...</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: We are talking 70 to 80 billion, it depends on your estimates. I  have heard 80 billion being -- that would be, by far, I think the largest  LBO in history of LBOs, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, it might get the numbers -- it might get the numbers  right. </p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it sounds right. </p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, just check my numbers on this, but this is huge. If he  doesn't have the financing secured for this and he tweeted he did, well,  that's a problem. </p><p>MACDONALD: That means he was taking out shorts. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: It means he is not -- he is releasing stuff for the investing  public that is not accurate.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right.</p><p>GASPARINO: That's the problem. </p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Charlie. Great stuff there. Come back on soon.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. </p><p>MACDONALD: We love having you on. Now, look at this story, a new high  sensitivity blood test may be able to pick up whether or not you are going  to have a heart attack, faster -- and faster and more accurately  potentially than the existing test. Dr. Siegel is here on that and what it  means for you. </p><p>But we're going to take on Alexandria Cortez again, we've got new stuff,  new debate, what is she saying today? You won't believe what she said  today. My panel takes its on next, stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: ... of the last, there has  been there reluctance to say, oh, don't moralize the issues. And I push  back on that, because -- like, we are in a time of right and wrong. </p><p>The issues of today are all moral, right to healthcare is a moral issue,  the idea that we have largest population of homeless people since Great  Depression in New York City, is a moral issue. The fact that there are  three empty luxury apartments for every one person experiencing  homelessness is a moral issue. The fact that kids are going into trailers  in back of their schools to get an education, because we won't guild  schools is a moral issue. All of these things are moral decisions.</p><p>We need to take this moment, and we have to -- we really do need to claim  the moral high ground. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You've got that right. She is making important point, Alexandria  Cortez about the problems out there and how a lot of them are moral issues.  But then, she is saying basically, I am going to take a moral high ground.  So, here is the problem. Will all of her policy ideas be morally right?  Let's take it up with the political panel, Republican strategist Ford  O'Connell, and Democrat strategist Raj Goyle. So, everything she is going  to do is going to be moral? Ford, is that -- is that what is happening?</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Oh, yes. And that's absolutely the  case, because that's the only way you can sell Medicare for all, free jobs,  free housing, free college education, because these policies, as history  teaches you, ignore modern history, basic math, and rise of oppressive  regimes. When we talk about socialism, E-Mac, you and I hear Venezuela, the  USSR, very bad folks. Well, today's millenials basically hear is what she  is talking about, which is Canada, Switzerland, affordable housing,  affordable college. It's the difference between what we know and what  millenials hear. And that's why it is gaining traction.</p><p>MACDONALD: Cortez is also complaining, Raj, about prosperity. But socialism  didn't make this country prosperous, it was capitalism. And on the  Democratic socialists' website, it says that the government will control  energy and the steel sectors, and also the consumer good sector. That's  what the Democratic socialists want.</p><p>RAJ GOYLE, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: Yeah, well, I have to say it is just a  little bit ironic for somebody from the Republican Party to suddenly say  that morality does not have a role...</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Well, what about what I'm talking about? </p><p>GOYLE: The reality is that actually these issues that she is talking about,  I think I agree with Ford on notion that the younger people in America, the  people who are hurting a lot of Trump base, the same base that actually  voted for Bernie Sanders, when he almost won the Democratic primary...</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you going to answer my question about what I just said about  government controlling the whole sectors of the economy. </p><p>GOYLE: Yeah. Look, everybody is a capitalist. We know that. She said that.  And it is a nice...</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: She is. She absolutely is.</p><p>MACDONALD: She is not a capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: Here is the actual issue. </p><p>MACDONALD: Why do you think -- hang on. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Ford, stay there. Wait a second. Ford, Ford, why do we think  she is a capitalist?</p><p>O'CONNELL: We don't think that she is a capitalist. And frankly, she is  actually dragging rest of Democratic Party down with her. Look at what she  said about unemployment. The reason why unemployment is low is because  people working two or three jobs. Within five minutes later, Elizabeth  Warren said it is actually because they are working four or five jobs. The  bottom-line is she not a capitalist. What they are looking for is they are  looking to retake power, they're looking to play on people's emotions. And  they're willing to do anything...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Hold on a second.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: One second, one second, one second.</p><p>GOYLE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>MACDONALD: The point that she is making are good ones. </p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely. </p><p>MACDONALD: There are people suffering out there. </p><p>GOYLE: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: Hang on. We're talking about the solutions that work. And the  solutions there have failed in countries around the world. </p><p>GOYLE: The people in this country -- look, I represent a very red district  in the reddest part of the red estate state in this country. I knock on  15,000 doors. My former constituents, now a Trump district, would have  agreed with notion that we need change. And that's why Donald Trump got  elected. He was a change candidate. But the issues, and the reason that I  agree with Ford is that the Republican Party is in absolute meltdown right  now. The only person who has lost a major national election in this cycle  because was he an extremist (ph) is Roy Moore in Alabama. </p><p>O'CONNELL: He was also pedophile, to be honest. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOYLE: ... who is nominated and the leader of the Republican Party  supported him. Why in the Virginia U.S. Senate race, Liz, is the Republican  Party not even competing because...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL: ... in 2005. It is absolutely ridiculous to say we lost the  Virginia race because somehow we could actually compete. Yeah, we could win  now and then in Virginia. In Alabama, guess what, we needed a senate seat  and he didn't back...</p><p>MACDONALD: He put one away.</p><p>O'CONNELL: He backed my former client, Luther Strange, who actually lost. </p><p>MACDONALD: Just hang on a second, we used a harsh term that we can't use on  this network, pedophile, OK? </p><p>O'CONNELL: Sorry about that, my apologies.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's OK. Understood.  Well, we got one more minute to go. I  don't understand why you're saying she is a capitalist because she is not a  capitalist. </p><p>GOYLE: Look, I get -- I get what the objective here is, which is we need a  liberal punching back because...</p><p>MACDONALD: No, no, you are not. I'm sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Excuse me, Raj, Raj, you are not answering -- you're not  answering the question of why you claimed she is a capitalist. We got to  have to leave it there. Ford and Raj, thank you so much. I really  appreciate it.</p><p>O'CONNELL: Ty, E-Mac.</p><p>GOYLE: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, we have a healthcare game-changer, carmaker GM working out  a deal with a local hospital group, instead of dealing with insurers. GM  saying it's a good thing. We got it coming up. Doc Siegel on that after the  break.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, look at this healthcare game-changer. Carmaker GM  designing to offer a healthcare plan for workers. To break it down, Doc  Siegel is here. Well, this is a big deal, Doc.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX BUSINESS: I like this. </p><p>MACDONALD: Why?</p><p>SIEGEL: You know why, it cuts out the middleman, it cuts down costs. The  average is going to be $300 to $900 in premiums less. They are starting it  out with 24,000 employees, but we know General Motors has 180,000  employees. And guess what they're using, Liz, the Henry Ford Healthcare  System in Detroit. How ironic, General Motors going to Henry Ford Hospital.  It's a very good hospital. They're going to be able to get next-day  service. They're going to have access to 3,000 healthcare providers. You're  going to get surgery. It's going to be all in one place. And you know what,  prescription drug prices will be less because again, pharmacy benefit  managers step in and take a profit for negotiating a deal. General Motors  has the power behind it that they can negotiate directly with healthcare  providers, lower costs and lower prices. </p><p>MACDONALD: OK, so, GM is handling it. How are they going to protect them  bottom-line by doing it this way.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think they're going to do that because it is going to cut out  waste. So the bottom-line will be -- will be better, though actually not  waste money. So, again, the money doesn't get chewed up by GM. It gets  chewed up the middleman.</p><p>MACDONALD: You like this. It sounds you really like this.</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, Boeing is doing it. And Intel is doing it. And 11 percent of  all employers are doing it. Everybody knows that the money in the  healthcare system is not lost with the doctor or the patient or even the  employer. It's lost with the insurance companies and with the pharmacy  benefit managers.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow, what a story. Can you come back on and we'll talk more  about it?</p><p>SIEGEL: I'm very excited about this. It is a private way to cut down  healthcare cost.</p><p>MACDONALD: Doc Siegel, we love having you on.</p><p>SIEGEL: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Come back soon. We're going to have more after the break, stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Breaking news, the Trump White House set to impose  a second set of tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese imports starting  August 23rd. That's just two weeks away. We're going to stay on that story  for you.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for having us in your homes. Thank you for  watching. Adam Shapiro here now with \"MAKING MONEY.\" Take it away, Adam.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

This doesn\u2019t make sense.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Peter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.</p><p>If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.</p><p>On the one hand, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html\">the F.C.C. has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality</url>, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can\u2019t pay the fees.</p><p>On the other hand, just a day before the F.C.C. announcement, the Justice Department communicated starkly different values. Announcing its opposition to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&amp;T, it used an argument based on the very kind of thinking that\u2019s often used to defend net neutrality: The department made the case that if the merger were allowed to go through, AT&amp;T might favor the Time Warner content it would own post-merger, to the disadvantage of rivals.</p><p>The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.</p><p>For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.</p><p>It could be that the notion of net neutrality that the F.C.C. seems determined to jettison should also be applied to media monopolies. When <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html\">the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion</url> in June for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals, it was essentially for a violation of neutrality: The union noted that Google was both a service provider (that users could use to conduct searches) and a content provider (that provided its own restaurant, hotel and other product recommendations) and was favoring its own content in search results over that of rivals that also provided recommendations, like Yelp.</p><p>Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.</p><p>Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.</p><p>But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?</p><p>The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&amp;T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&amp;T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.</p><p>For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.</p><p>The administration can\u2019t have it both ways.</p><p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Friday.  It is Friday, November 9th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are on edge this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a  triple digit decline at the start of trading, down 130 points on the Dow,  down 16 on the S&amp;P, down 61 points on the Nasdaq -- almost 1 percent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a mixed story yesterday.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged as expected.  But some  thought the central bank would signal a dovish tone following the market  volatility last month.  We did not see that.</p><p>DowIndustrials were up 11 points.  S&amp;P 500 down 7.  Nasdaq down 39 at the  close yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning also under pressure.  FT 100 in London down  almost 1 percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris down better than 1 percent and the  DAX index in Germany down two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  Worst performer Hong Kong  better than 2 percent lower.</p><p>Meanwhile oil entering a bear market.  Oil prices are now down 20 percent  from their most recent high.  Why it could be a warning for what's to come  in the global economy.</p><p>Plus, madam speaker, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi standing firm that  she will get that gavel back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  I will be the speaker of  the people's House.  I feel very confident about where I am.  And I feel  very encouraged by the overwhelming support in my caucus that will go to  the floor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, she may still face a tough road to victory.  We're taking  a look at the race for house speaker this morning.</p><p>And a bomb shell lawsuit in Florida -- Rick Scott is alleging Democrats  were trying to steal the election.  The details later this hour as Florida  is looking at a recount.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Rosecliff CEO and  managing partner Mike Murphy; and former Utah Congressman, former House  Oversight Committee chairman and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz.  Good  morning.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  What a week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a week.  It's been an incredible week.  A lot of news and  we have a lot of open questions still.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  Yes.  From the firing of Jeff Sessions which we forgot to  mention earlier in the list of things to an amazing election to the  President traveling overseas.  He's got a lot on his plate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's headed to Paris.  And we're going to probably see  him leave this morning.  What's on your mind?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But now with Florida and the --  again, we know that the Republicans will hold a majority in the Senate but  you have Sinema now leading McSally in the vote count in Arizona.  Florida  headed for a recount.  Some shenanigans going on according to Governor Rick  Scott there.</p><p>And so there's a lot of -- a lot is up in the air at this point.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Even the Georgia governor's race is still -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Even the Georgia's governor's -- that's right.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  My glass being half full, I'm  hoping that now we have some bipartisanship that somehow we get -- instead  of just everyone attacking everyone, we get some people working together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's why the markets I guess rallied.  Maybe markets  like the divided government -- 545 points higher on the Dow the day after  the midterms.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And you know, one, it took a lot of the uncertainty out.   But two, I think we sold off into the elections because we weren't sure  what the outcomes were going to be.  So getting some of that back.</p><p>But now, for the last two months of the year, we have to see if big tech  can resume its leadership in the market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know if I would cut a deal with somebody who is not  acting in your best interest.  I will say that about Washington, Jason  Chaffetz.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm trying to get to one over here.  I sat for two years when  Nancy Pelosi was the speaker, I didn't see an ounce of bipartisanship in  those two years.  So color me tainted but I've got to tell you, I sat there  and saw it for myself.</p><p>And I don't think -- she said she has the overwhelming majority but she  needs 218 people specifically to vote for her as speaker.  And she is not  there yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I turned on the TV yesterday and I saw her at  the podium speaking and doing this long press conference, I said, it's  going to be a long couple of years.  She's going to be at that podium  talking about everything she wants.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But don't underestimate her though because I sat here repeatedly  and mocked and disparaged that crumbs comment about the $2,000 bonuses that  companies handed out but, you know what, she dropped that, didn't she.  And  she focused solely on the issue of health care.</p><p>Quite frankly, I think the Democrats and the messaging made that the number  one issue.  They preyed on people's fears about pre-existing condition  coverage and it helped them in the House, most definitely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she probably will get the job because of her fund raising  efforts.  Isn't she a master fundraiser -- Jason.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In the history of the United States Congress, the House and the  Senate, nobody has ever raised more money than Nancy Pelosi.  That's why  she's at the top of the heap.  But she's not the speaker yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see.  You're really skeptical she's going to  get that 218.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  She's going to put a couple of dozen members in jeopardy because  they all pledged that they would never vote for Nancy Pelosi to be the  speaker.  It's a real dilemma for her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Democratic House candidates this cycle, we don't even have  the final tally, raised $1 billion.  And that's 50 percent more than the  Republicans raised.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, they definitely out-raised the Republicans this  season as well.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm so glad I'm out of the business of raising money, I tell you  that.  I hated it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I bet.  I bet.  That's hard.</p><p>We have a lot coming up in all of the above.  But let's get to our top  story this hour.  And that is President Trump reaching across the aisle to  keep driving strong economic growth in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now is the time for members  of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the  American economic miracle going strong.  It is a miracle.  We're doing so  well. </p><p>And I've said it at a lot of rallies.  Some of you have probably heard it  so much, you don't want to hear it again.  But when people come to my  office -- presidents, prime ministers, they all congratulate me, almost the  first thing on what we've done economically because it is really amazing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment  officer, Krishna Memani.  Krishna -- good to see you.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS:  Good to see  you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you do -- you agree that the economy is amazing and doing  well but you see a slowdown on the horizon.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Yes.  I think the economy today is doing reasonably well.  We are  probably going to end up somewhere north of 3 percent for the year.</p><p>But I think the slowdown is already unfolding.  So by the middle of next  year, we are talking about getting back to close to 2 percent rather than 3  percent that we have seen in 2018.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think the slowdown is based only on higher interest  rates?  I mean the Fed left interest rates unchanged yesterday but it does  look like we're going to see a rate hike in the month of December.  Is that  what's slowing things down or something else?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, that certainly is slowing things down a tad.  But I think  part of it is because the capital spending cycle that we expected -- the  capital spending boost never materialized.</p><p>So for the economy to get to a higher level, we need higher level of  productivity.  And productivity is improving but not to the level that we  need it to be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've talked about this a lot -- Dagen.  The cap -- one second,  Mike -- I'm sorry.  But the cap ex -- when the President rolled back and  Congress rolled back all of those regulations earlier, you know, early in  his administration, cap spending did increase.  And we were like oh,  businesses have been sitting on cash for 10 years, they're finally putting  it to work.</p><p>Was it trade, do you think, the worries over steel and aluminum that  stopped businesses to say wait, let me -- I'm not sure about this.  I'm  going to sit on cash again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hard to quantify but likely playing into that decision making  because business expenditures in the first quarter, I think were up 11.5  percent.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the most recent quarter that we got, in the third quarter,  they were up only eight-tenths of a percent.  Can that -- is this just a  momentary kind of waning because of the concerns about trade.  </p><p>We've gotten the Canada and the Mexico deal done and these get ratified by  Congress.  There's movement with Europe.  Is that really what's in the way?   Or -- is it just a momentary pause heading toward the end of the year.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Look, I think from a cyclical standpoint in this cycle capital  spending never got to the level that it has in the past.  And I think the  likelihood that will get there this late in the cycle is probably very  small.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MEMANI: Having said that, the capital spending is higher at this point in  the cycle than it was in the beginning.  But it's not enough to get us to 3  percent growth rate, I don't think.</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm going to push back a little bit here because for investors at  home watching this, you know, trying to time the market, you know, I'm sure  you heard the saying it's not timing the market, it's your time in the  market.  So to try to reallocate assets out of funds or if you're planning  for a slowdown, I think it's very dangerous for people to start to take  their retirement funds for instance and say well, I'm going to move over  here, now reallocating on an active basis.</p><p>I would advise people watching at home that we're going to go through ups  and downs in the market -- </p><p>MEMANI:  Sure.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- but stay invested because investors will typically panic out at  the wrong time like last month and then not know when to get back in.  </p><p>MEMANI:  I couldn't agree with you more.  Far from telling people to get  out of the market, you kind of go back and look at things.  In this cycle  the most amount of money that you have made is just being there, rather  than being out of the market.</p><p>Our view right now is five more years.  That is this cycle will probably  last another three, four, five years.  It's not ending in 2019 or 2020 that  some people are forecasting. </p><p>At this point, there's enough momentum in the economy to carry us through  for a long time.  Inflation hasn't manifested itself.  So absolutely stay  in the markets.  There's no reason to take your money home just yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to ask you about trade because the U.S. and China are  locked in a stalemate over trade.  Despite the tensions, October saw a  reported 30 percent increase in Chinese exports to the United States from a  year ago.  </p><p>This a Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are  scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Washington today.  So  I want to ask you about the Chinese strategy.  But first there's an article  in the \"Journal\" today which is questioning this new house leadership and  what that does for USMCA.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we're supposed to see this ratified by Congress as Dagen  just noted in the New Year.  Do the Democrats stop this?  Do they force --  you know, just because they've taken over the House majority or is it all  about the Senate?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's really hard to see where they're coming from as long as  this leadership race is still in play.  I don't think they take a hard  position and go to the President and say this is what we need out of it.  I  don't think that happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think it gets ratified.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I do think it ultimately gets ratified because I think blue  collar America wants it to happen.  </p><p>MEMANI:  I think it gets ratified for the simple reason that it's really  good policy.  I think free trade is a good thing.  If you kind of go back  and look at the Chinese data that you were talking about, at the end of the  day trade hasn't really gone down meaningfully.</p><p>What has risen is basically tension in people's minds and that's kind of  ending up taking away from capital spending that we need at this point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to note is -- in this \"Wall Street Journal\" article  that Maria mentioned -- the unions will put pressure on the Democrat to  ratify this.  This is a huge win for the auto workers in this country  because it discourages auto manufacturers from moving production down to  Mexico for cheap labor.  It's a big win.</p><p>And quite frankly, the steel tariffs are a big win for the steelworkers of  the country.  So they've got a lot.  So all it takes is maybe a couple of  phone calls from the union leaders to Nancy Pelosi's office, I guarantee  they get on board.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Donald Trump didn't become President Trump without those people  swaying into his corner.  They didn't believe where Hillary Clinton was on  this.  And even though it will give Donald Trump a victory, they have to go  there and that's the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard Trumka joined us earlier in the week and just said  exactly what you said, actually.  That it was a good deal.  And he really  faced criticism from those outside the union.</p><p>So Krishna bottom line here, with all said, you're expecting this slowdown.   Would you put your money to work in stocks?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Absolutely.  Again, as I mentioned before, five more years.  We  expect the cycle to continue.  There's still a lot of upside left in the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even technology?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEMANI:  Especially in technology.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We need tech leadership.  And I think you're going to see it in  the last two months of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We need tech leadership, why?  Because that will confirm that  this market is on firm footing.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  But also because that's where the growth is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  So you need growth to have -- that's the strong leadership.   Otherwise you have weak leadership which will eventually fail.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Those companies are actually executing fantastically.  So I think  tech is going to remain the leader.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Is there any sector you don't like?  </p><p>MEMANI:  So I think the interest rate sensitive sectors is kind of in the  walking around with an x on their back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like financials.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Financials, housing -- things like that, because the fed will  continue to tighten for at least another six months.  So I think there will  be a time for that.  But that's probably middle of next year rather than  right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Krishna -- great to get your  insights.</p><p>MEMANI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Krishna Memani, Oppenheimer there.</p><p>Coming up, searching for a motive -- families are mourning this morning  after 12 people were killed in a bar shooting in southern California  yesterday.  We have the very latest from southern California.</p><p>And then Speaker Pelosi once again -- Nancy Pelosi's renewed confidence in  getting that gavel back.  </p><p>All next, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New details emerging this morning about the mass shooting in California in  that bar yesterday.  Fox's Jonathan Hunt is in Thousand Oaks, California  this morning with the very latest.  Jonathan -- good morning.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p>Hundreds of people turned out last night at a number of vigils to honor and  remember the 12 people who were killed at the Borderline Bar and Grill, and  to offer support to the victims' families.</p><p>Among those who died was a man whose mother says he survived the Las Vegas  shooting massacre at a country music concert in October, 2017.  Listen here  to that distraught mother.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSAN SCHMIDT-ORFANOS, VICTIM'S MOTHER:  My son was in Las Vegas with a lot  of his friends and he came home.  He didn't come home last night.</p><p>And I don't want prayers.  I don't want thoughts.  I want gun control.  And  I hope to God nobody else sends me anymore prayers.  I want gun control.   No more guns.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Now, the gunman has been identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a  U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan.</p><p>We have obtained overnight disturbing video of the moments when he opened  fire.  Watch and listen here.</p><p>(VIDEO OF SHOOTING)</p><p>HUNT:  He used a Glock-21 .45 caliber as his weapon of choice.  It was  legally bought, Maria, but it had an extended magazine, enabling him to  fire more rounds.  Those are illegal in California -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Jonathan -- thank you.</p><p>Jonathan Hunt in Thousand Oaks this morning.</p><p>We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, three massive wildfires across California to tell you  about.  Several firefighters injured while battling these blazes.  The  latest coming up.</p><p>Then hey Alexa, give me Insight -- how author and advocate Deepak Chopra is  teaming jp with Amazon to fill your morning routine with positive vibes.   He's here in studio.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Insights and inspiration from world renowned Dr. Deepak Chopra in the palm  of your hand -- thanks to a partnership between the Web site Live Person  and Amazon's Alexa.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA, AUTHOR:  I have this little microphone attached to this  little phone.  And I just speak out to what I'm thinking and what my  intention for the day is.  And then it's recorded here and it goes to Live  Person and then it's on Alexa.  It's all done very efficiently and smoothly  and it's part of my daily routine now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the author of the brand-new book, \"You  are the Universe\" and alternative medicine advocate, Deepak Chopra.  Great  to see you -- Deepak.  Thanks for being here this morning.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  Tell us about this new venture.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Well, for the last 40 years I've been sharing my insights or  reflections, meditations with people.  It started with friends, then  family, then social media, and now Alexa.</p><p>It wasn't planned but you know, I start my day with a few reflections and  intentions -- a joyful, energetic body, love and compassion in the heart,  clarity of mind, lightness of being.  Then I expand on that and somehow  Alexa picks it up to Live Person.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us why that -- tell us why that's so important, the  clarity that you try to have.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think setting an intention or even asking yourself a simple  question like what do I want is enough.  You don't have to actually  concentrate on having a specific intention.</p><p>If you ask yourself, what do I want for me today or for the world or for my  kids or -- you will already have a response there.  That brings clarity to  your intention.  And if you start letting go and settle in your being, then  that intention organizes its own fulfillment through synchronicity.  That's  a well-known spiritual tradition at least in the east.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that organizes you to deal with sort of the chaos of the  day or the noise of the day.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  The noise of the day.  You carry your peace wherever you go,  no matter what.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The technology is pretty user-friendly as well.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think the technology is going to be the next phase of our  evolution for higher consciousness, if we want it.  Technology can be  destructive, as you know.  Anything you can do with technology -- including  hack the elections or whatever.  But technology can also create a more  peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier and joyful world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how does technology change going forward?  What do you see  that could be possible?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  What we see as the Internet -- that's our global brain right now.   So if I send an abusive tweet, let's say to somebody in Africa, I could  give them high blood pressure just by doing that.</p><p>On the other hand, I send them an emoticon with a hug, it could give them a  dopamine hit.  So, you know, technology is bringing together the collective  brain.  And the Internet is the human condition.  If we don't like what's  happening in the world we have to change that interconnectivity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is Live Person looking to recruit other celebrities to partake  in AI-powered conversation?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think they are, yes.  They're already looking at other people,  influencers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And maybe that will resonate with people to bring new people  in.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  We need a critical mass of people who want a more peaceful,  just, sustainable, healthier, and joyful world.  That can only happen if we  collectively have that intention and rewire our collective brain, which is  the Internet.  It's our brain.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you do new intentions every day?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do those intentions come to you?  Just depends on what  you're looking for that day -- what do you want?</p><p>CHOPRA:  I do a morning meditation which is always preceded by four  questions.  Who am I?  What do I want?  What's my purpose?  And what am I  grateful for?  And then something comes up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That will lead you to your intention.  Very good.</p><p>Tell us about book, \"You are the Universe\", the main theme.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  It's about the fact that we live in a human universe.  What you  see outside here is a human creation.  But what we don't realize is even  things like stars, galaxies and our own bodies are human concepts around  perceptual experiences. </p><p>In other words, the world is not out there.  It's in you.  Your body is in  you.  Your mind is in you.  By you, I mean the infinite consciousness that  modifies itself as perceptions, thoughts, feelings, emotions.</p><p>So any experience you have, doesn't matter what the experience.  It's  either a sensation or a perception or an image or a feeling or a thought.   Once you understand that, you can go back through the source, through  meditation as you're doing right now, then that opens the door to  creativity, insight, intuition, imagination -- everything else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gives you that clarity that you're looking for.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deepak -- thanks very much.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Thanks, Maria, for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to talk with you as always.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deepak Chopra.</p><p>Coming up, buying a home will cost you more.  Mortgage rates are surging to  the highest level in nearly a decade.</p><p>Plus the taste of Christmas this morning, this wine and cheese advent  calendar is so popular it's fetching a hefty price on eBay.  Wait until you  see it.  We've got it here.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, November 9th.   Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Wall Street in the red this morning.  Take a look, we're at the lows of the  morning right here with the Dow Industrials set to open down about 140  points, that's one half of one percent lower.  S&amp;P is down two thirds of a  percent and the NASDAQ with a 68 point decline, down almost one percent  right now.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected yesterday.   The markets were quiet.  The major indices finished mostly flat on that  news, up 11 points on the Dow, down seven on the S&amp;P, down 40 points on the  NASDAQ yesterday.  </p><p>In Europe, the selling continues, down across the board, FT-100 down one  percent, as is the CAC Quarante, DAX Index in Germany down two thirds of  one percent.  </p><p>Overnight in Asia, similar story, lower across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 2-1/3 percent on the Hang Seng.  </p><p>Oil has entered a bear market.  The price of crude oil down 21 percent in  just under a month.  Oil now below $60.00 a barrel.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Florida election turmoil, big story this morning, Governor Rick  Scott asking for an investigation into voter fraud after accusing Democrats  of trying to steal the midterm election.  </p><p>Fast moving wildfires in California to report, two firefighters are injured  battling three blazes.  Look at that.  Plus, thousands of residents fleeing  for their lives including Kim Kardashian, among others.  </p><p>Mortgage mess, home sales slowing down, mortgage rates surging to the  highest level in nearly a decade.  We've got the details on how much it is  costing now.  </p><p>And then, cheers to you, all these wine Advent calendars sold out fast.   You can still find one, we've got it here, it may cost you a pretty penny,  though.  We're going to tell you all about it coming up.  </p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the battle for the gavel, House  Minority leader Nancy Pelosi officially launching her bid for House  speakership.  And in an interview last night, she weighed in on her  chances.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN:  What is your level of confidence that you'll be  the speaker of the House?  </p><p>SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  total.  </p><p>CUOMO:  100 percent?  </p><p>PELOSI:  100 percent.  </p><p>CUOMO:  Do you have any reservations about whether or not you want this in  your life at this point?  </p><p>PELOSI:  No, none, whatsoever.  I've had -- it's an urgency that I can't  resist.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is The Weekly Standard deputy editor Kelly  Jane Torrance.  Kelly Jane, good to see you this morning.  Is she a shoe-in  for this?  </p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  No, she is not,  Maria.  And you know, her confidence is impressive.  You know, we talk a  lot about big egos here in Washington and we always talk about men.  But  let's face it; women can have big egos too.  And I think -- you know, very  few in Washington have them as big as Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>You know, so they -- a bunch of -- about a dozen Democrats who do not want  to see her as speaker.  Again, actually, organized a call last night,  trying to figure out how they can stop her.  One of them was Conor Lamb of  Pennsylvania who of course is -- you know, a moderate Democrat, recently  ran and won his seat.  Another was Tim Ryan of Ohio who actually had run  against Pelosi in the past.  He says he doesn't want to run this time but  he's trying to find someone, anyone who will.  And that might be actually  the biggest problem for the Pelosi opponents is there doesn't seem to be a  candidate that people are sort of getting behind and interested in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE:  And no one's -- no one's declared they want to run.  And of  course, I don't blame them because who wants to get on Nancy Pelosi's bad  side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, they don't want to run but they don't want her to  run.  In fact, Tim Ryan joined me on Sunday, Congressman from Ohio, and I  asked him if he's going to challenge her.  I think he's actually more  interested in challenging President Trump in 2020 but he did say he is not  voting for Pelosi.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the 2016 election you wanted to unseat Nancy Pelosi to  become speaker of the House.  Are you running for Speaker of the House this  time?  </p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  We got a couple more days.  There are a number of  candidates that are having conversations that are talking about running.  I  will say it's not going to be a coronation.  Somebody is going to run for  leadership.  I think it's important that we have this discussion and have  this conversation.  I think the American people want a change.  I think a  lot of Democrats want a change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RYAN:  And so, we're going to have that discussion starting on Wednesday  and let's hope we're having a conversation about speaker of the House and  not leader of the minority party in Congress.  But there's a lot of  conversations happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Jason Chaffetz is here, Kelly Jane.  And you (INAUDIBLE)  from the beginning, you don't think she has the votes.  </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, there's too many people that  were on the record and remember, the very first vote that you cast as a  member of Congress is who's going to be the next speaker.  And you're going  to ask these people like Lamb out of Pennsylvania to take that tough vote.   So, I don't know how she gets to 218.  But you're right, she certainly is  confident.  </p><p>But Kelly, I want to ask you, has leader McCarthy signaled what's going to  happen in the next seven weeks?  I mean, the Republicans are still in  control in the House and Senate and the presidency for the next seven  weeks.  Have we seen what that agenda is going to be?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  No, we -- you know what, I've heard very little coming through.   And you know, even Republicans are calling it a lame duck session, which  you know, you think, you've got your last chance to do something and they  don't seem very interested in taking it.  I think they're a little more  preoccupied and worried about what's going to come next.  </p><p>Now, of course one of the things that Donald Trump has talked about  upcoming in the House is the speaker run and he's of course tweeted that he  really thinks the Democrats should have Nancy Pelosi.  And I don't think  that has helped her cause.  </p><p>But you know, as you -- as you -- you know, it was funny because you had  Tim Ryan on and talked about, Maria, you said he might want to run against  President Trump.  Well, he actually brought up Trump and Pelosi in the same  sentence this week after the elections, saying that, pointing out that exit  polls showed that Nancy Pelosi's negatives were on par with Trump's at 55  percent, he said.  So, he's definitely trying to tie those two together.   And we'll see how successful he is.  But I mean, Jason, do you think  there's anyone who's really ready to step up and challenge her?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I -- there's got to be somebody, somebody in that leadership  team will actually change.  And I think between the congressional black  caucus, the Hispanic caucus.  I think Lujan has a -- has a great case to  make that he helped bring them back into power.  In fact, that California  and New York have so many members is going to be a problematic.  But you  basically see Democrats on the coast.  You don't hear much about a Tim Ryan  because there aren't as many Democrats in the middle part of the country  and they certainly haven't gotten organized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes and there's this fight, right, within the Democratic Party  since they've gone lurching all the way to the left.  And that's one of the  issues.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we've got to get to the Florida Senate race.  Because this  is also one of the top stories.  We've got to get your take on this  situation, getting even tighter.  Republican candidate Rick Scott filing  explosive lawsuit against top election officials in two heavily Democratic  counties.  He detailed the allegations at a news conference yesterday.   Watch this Kelly Jane.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I will not sit idly by why  unethical liberals try to steal this election.  Their goal is to keep  mysteriously finding more votes until the elections turn out the way they  want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the same in Arizona Kelly Jane, your reaction?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, you know, I have to say, you know, Bill Nelson is trying to  claim that -- you know, this is a politically motivated action by Rick  Scott, by -- you know, getting law enforcement to investigate.  Well,  what's wrong with an investigation?  What do you have to worry about?  I  thought Democrats were all in favor of investigations to find out the  truth.  And let's face it, Broward county, you know, Miami-Dade, recounts,  we've heard about this before haven't we?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we have.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  And these are -- you know, heavily Democratic districts.  And  when you have suddenly votes being tallied and very quickly the margin  changing from one where there wasn't going to be a recount to close enough  where there were not only be a machine recount, there'd be a hand recount.   You do have to worry about that.  </p><p>Now, the deadline is Saturday noon for them to -- for the counties to file  the election results.  So, Rick Scott was in court.  He's trying to get  emergency hearings.  So something can happen because of course, once you  get that hand recount, again, these officials, it's a very heavily  Democratic area and I don't blame him for being nervous.  And you know,  Arizona too, we saw very quickly all of a sudden margins changing, you  know, within an hour we had -- you know, almost a percentage point I think.  </p><p>So yes, you know, it's very nerve-racking.  Especially with the  Republicans, no matter what happens in these two races, looks like  Republicans are going to hold the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE:  But of course, those margins matter a lot as we saw over the  last year.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Look, there were tens of thousands of votes difference going  into this race in the previous recounts or previous times it was less than  a thousand votes.  So, there -- it really does something -- seem to be  something suspicious here.  And I think it was actually Senator Marco Rubio  that was really pointing it out earlier in the day yesterday, if you go  back and look at his tweets and what he was saying about the shenanigans  that have been happening there in Florida.  But you also have these  allegations about how some of the counties in Arizona have been counting  this too.  And there is obviously a lot on the line.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  And you know, it's crazy  to me that we've talked so much about Russian meddling in our elections and  now we don't need Russia, we're meddling in our own elections here.  I  mean, there have -- we have to use technology to make this voting process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, now there are accusations of racism in Florida and Georgia  and that's why Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams didn't win.  Let me just  point out that President Barack Obama won Florida two times and John James  in Michigan lost.  So is that racism?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It is interesting in Arizona because Governor Ducey was  reelected by a very large margin.  And the number of people that would have  to take to vote for Ducey and then switch parties to vote for Krysten  Sinema, that's a fascinating number.  It doesn't seem to make a lot of  sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was incredible how close Sinema.  I mean, now Sinema is in  the lead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, he was campaign -- Doug Ducey was campaigning a lot with  Martha McSally to at the very end.  Trying to pull her across the line with  him.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But who goes to the poll and votes Ducey, Sinema?  That doesn't  make a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it doesn't.  And what about this, Michelle Obama ripping  President Trump in her new book Becoming.  She writes about the shock that  she felt on election night when she learned that President Trump would  succeed her husband, saying that she tries to, quote, block it all out.   Kelly Jane, your reaction?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  You know, I'm trying not to laugh too hard.  Block it all out.   Well, you know, yes, she's upset that someone that replaced her husband is  dismantling some of his legacy, and I sort of hate to use the word legacy  because it hasn't been positive.  I mean, look at how much the economy has  gotten better since then.  </p><p>And I -- you know, look at Iran.  I mean, you had a president who is you  know, sucking up to people who murder their own people for speaking out  against the government and now we have someone who's standing with the  people of Iran.  So, yes, she has a right to be upset a little bit, I  guess.  But is this all -- is this book just a ploy?  Is she going to run?   What's the point of the book otherwise, right?  It has to make a lot of  money which you know, politicians like to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to add really quickly, you can look at the  expression on Michelle Obama's face, the first lady's face on Inauguration  Day.  She was sick of Washington and it had nothing to do with right versus  left, Republican versus Democrat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think she just wanted out of the political circles of D.C.   I'll just throw that in there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those were right, it's true, yes.  Kelly Jane, go ahead.  Final  word.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  I was going to say, you know what, Dagen, great point, although,  I think she likes to still be in the arena.  I mean, she's made so many  comments since then.  I think, you know, she didn't like being in the --  you know, the everyday life, political life of D.C.  But she likes to talk  a lot of the big picture.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, she wrote a book.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She wrote a book, Becoming.  Kelly Jane Torrance, good to see  you.  Thank you so much.  We will see you soon.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Thank you, have a great weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.  Coming up, we've got a trio of wildfires burning  across California, incredible pictures, injuring two firefighters.  Take a  look, the blazes forced thousands of people from their homes including Kim  Kardashian among others.  We're going to tell you her story when we come  back.  </p><p>And then, mortgage rates are surging to the highest level in nearly 10  years.  It is taking a toll on the housing market.  We'll tell you about  it, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Three major wildfires burning out of control  right now in California.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this is a fast-moving  fire, Maria.  It's forced evacuations in northern California.  The camp  fire has burned about 18,000 acres, destroying a number of structures, at  least two firefighters and multiple civilians have been injured so far.  </p><p>And then we're learning now that Kim Kardashian-West says that she was also  forced to leave her home in the town of Hidden Hills.  This happened last  night, because of that fire.  So she share this image on her Instagram  said, in part I pray everyone is safe.  But what's interesting is that she  was taking those pictures out of her jet as she was coming home Maria, only  to land and find out her own home was actually in danger.  </p><p>So meanwhile, let's look at Southern California.  Two wildfires have also  triggered evacuations in Ventura County.  The National Weather Service has  issued red flag warnings throughout much of the state.  Well, hopefully  this fire gets under control today when the sun comes up in the California.</p><p>Another headline we're following, the cost of financing the purchase of a  new home heading higher.  The average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage  jumped to 4.94 percent, that's the highest level in nearly eight years.   Higher rates are -- priced many prospective home buyers out of the market.   Existing home sales have fallen for the past six months.  Rates are  climbing of course, as the Fed is raising borrowing costs.  They don't want  the economy to overheat.  But your mortgage might be a little more  expensive.  </p><p>All right, then there is this, Aldi's first ever wine Advent calendar may  be sold out in stores but you can still get your hands on one.  But it's  going to frankly cost you a lot.  The (INAUDIBLE) calendar, it's got 24  mini bottles of wine guys for $70.00.  But now we're seeing it on eBay,  huge markup, one just sold for $300, Maria.  Plus $50.00 in shipping  because it's super heavy as we just found out on our set as we tried to  pick it up.  It's 21 pounds.  It's a wine calendar, it's got cheeses in it.   And they're not going to restock it.  So we got one on set but we can't  open it because it's a hot property.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  We can open the cheese.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't drink alcohol but (INAUDIBLE) I'll get the cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, let's see you open it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, why can't we open it though?  I mean, I'm not talking about  drinking it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's open it and look at it.  </p><p>CASONE:  This is supposedly hot property.  I know.  So, here's how this  works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take the cheese out, OK.</p><p>CASONE:  So, there's little mini bottles.  Well, I'm just going to do it.   If I get in trouble, well, I'll pay for it.  All right, so, there's like  one -- you know, 20 to 30 is the different day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to know how mini -- I want to know how mini these bottles  are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because if it's only like a glass per bottle.  </p><p>CASONE:  Look at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, so this is number --</p><p>CASONE:  Well then, that's not bad if it's a mini bottle.  Jason, you may  have to help me open this.  I can't get these open.</p><p>MURPHY:  The one issue is that with the Advent calendar I like to do it in  the morning.  Like, kind of tough to open the wine and that could create a  problem if you drinking the wine in the morning.  </p><p>CASONE:  All right, I can't get this open.  People are telling me to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CASONE:  Will you help me open it.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm all about the cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's all about the cheese.</p><p>CASONE:  I got the -- I'm trying to get the wine open.  Can we just take a  commercial break?  (INAUDIBLE) not to open the wine is kind of a shock.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Hang this on the wall and say kids, go get a piece of cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's like a gift.</p><p>CASONE:  If you pay the $300 guys, not to self, get a knife or something to  open it.  But there's little mini bottles of wine and it's all different  like Rose and Soras and Merlot and Cabs and all kinds of fun stuff, it's  fun.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Great for the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I love the Advent calendar.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I have the Gouda.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It better be more than a glass a bottle.  </p><p>CASONE:  They're baby bottles.  So, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Baby bottles (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm going to work on this, I'm not leaving.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, honoring veterans in style.  We're going to show you  more of these crafts created by a pair of sisters who also support veterans  through every stage of their business.  Wait until you see this.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Support veterans and honor them every day, that  is the mission behind the company Sword and Plough.  And we like that  mission right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Joining me right now are the  sisters behind the company, CEO and former U.S. Army Captain Emily Nunez is  here -- Emily Nunez Cavness along with co-founder and chief operating  officer Betsy Nunez.  Great to see you girls.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p>BETSY NUNEZ, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, SWORD AND PLOUGH:   Thank you for having us, Maria.  </p><p>EMILY NUNEZ-CAVNESS, CEO, SWORD AND PLOUGH:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm just -- you know, you just get me -- I mean, I'm in awe  knowing that you are in Kandahar  Afghanistan, what you've done, your  father is one of the great vets as well.  Thank you for your service.  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Thank you so much.  We are just thrilled to be here, especially  right before Veterans Day which is incredibly important to Sword and Plough  our mission.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is the company called Sword and Plough?  </p><p>CAVNESS:  So, it comes from the phrase to turns swords into ploughshares,  which means to take a military technology and apply it to a peaceful  civilian application.  And that's really exactly what we're doing with our  made in America products and repurposing thousands and thousands of  military surplus into all of our designs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this.  And the last time you came you had lots of camo  products.  Now, you have little camo and tell me about what the products  are this time.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Sure, so we've got an assortment.  We have everything from  jewelry, necklaces, earrings made out of repurposed bullet casing, 50  caliber shell casing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice.  My goodness, you're kidding.</p><p>CAVNESS:  Hand-hammered by an incredible female vet in Kentucky named  Shana.  And then we've got assortment of everything from bags to travel  kits, essentially anything for you, a family member, loved one and they  make perfect gifts for the holiday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the best selling item?  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Our best sellers are definitely our necklaces.  They're just so one  of a kind.  They don't look anything like what they're made out of.  This  big 50 caliber shell casing, and so, that's been a big hit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell me how that's done with the casing?  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Sure, this amazing veteran named Shana is in Kentucky, and she  actually hand hammers every single bullet casing into this beautiful pieces  of jewelry.  And she actually was a 50 caliber machine gunner when she was  in the Army and when she was deployed in Afghanistan.  So, it's an amazing  full circle -- full circle experience.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is incredible.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about the events you have on top this month.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Yes, so, we're gearing up for Veterans Day, obviously, big this  Sunday, and then gearing up for holiday season.  But today, we're donating  10 percent of profits from any of the sales on our website  SwordandPlough.com to bumper labs.  And they do incredible work.  They are  helping veterans and military spouses start their own business.  So the  sale of our products and the production of our products helps support  veteran employment and empowerment at every stage in our business.  And for  your viewers we have a special code, FOX10, for 10 percent off for today  through the weekend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for that discount for our viewers.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that, but it's real quality.  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Thank you, they last forever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They last forever.</p><p>NUNEZ:  We also have a steadfast guarantee.  So if anything should ever  happen, we repair it free of cost.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give me the average prices here.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Sure, we've got everything from $19.00 to $350, we do free  shipping on all orders $200 and up.  And everything from tote bag that  makes a great diaper bag or bag for work to a cosmetic case or a toiletry  case if you're traveling or if your husband needs an upgrade for the -- for  the bathroom sink.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Emily and Betsy, great to see you again.  Thanks so  much.  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Thank you -- thank you so much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Veterans Day to you both and to your father.

Good morning.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: What a week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a week. It's been an incredible week. A lot of news and we have a lot of open questions still.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. Yes. From the firing of Jeff Sessions which we forgot to mention earlier in the list of things to an amazing election to the President traveling overseas. He's got a lot on his plate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's headed to Paris. And we're going to probably see him leave this morning. What's on your mind?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: But now with Florida and the -- again, we know that the Republicans will hold a majority in the Senate but you have Sinema now leading McSally in the vote count in Arizona. Florida headed for a recount. Some shenanigans going on according to Governor Rick Scott there.</p><p>And so there's a lot of -- a lot is up in the air at this point.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Even the Georgia governor's race is still --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Even the Georgia's governor's -- that's right.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF: My glass being half full, I'm hoping that now we have some bipartisanship that somehow we get -- instead of just everyone attacking everyone, we get some people working together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's why the markets I guess rallied. Maybe markets like the divided government -- 545 points higher on the Dow the day after the midterms.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. And you know, one, it took a lot of the uncertainty out. But two, I think we sold off into the elections because we weren't sure what the outcomes were going to be. So getting some of that back.</p><p>But now, for the last two months of the year, we have to see if big tech can resume its leadership in the market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if I would cut a deal with somebody who is not acting in your best interest. I will say that about Washington, Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm trying to get to one over here. I sat for two years when Nancy Pelosi was the speaker, I didn't see an ounce of bipartisanship in those two years. So color me tainted but I've got to tell you, I sat there and saw it for myself.</p><p>And I don't think -- she said she has the overwhelming majority but she needs 218 people specifically to vote for her as speaker. And she is not there yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, when I turned on the TV yesterday and I saw her at the podium speaking and doing this long press conference, I said, it's going to be a long couple of years. She's going to be at that podium talking about everything she wants.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But don't underestimate her though because I sat here repeatedly and mocked and disparaged that crumbs comment about the $2,000 bonuses that companies handed out but, you know what, she dropped that, didn't she. And she focused solely on the issue of health care.</p><p>Quite frankly, I think the Democrats and the messaging made that the number one issue. They preyed on people's fears about pre-existing condition coverage and it helped them in the House, most definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And she probably will get the job because of her fund raising efforts. Isn't she a master fundraiser -- Jason.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: In the history of the United States Congress, the House and the Senate, nobody has ever raised more money than Nancy Pelosi. That's why she's at the top of the heap. But she's not the speaker yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see. You're really skeptical she's going to get that 218.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She's going to put a couple of dozen members in jeopardy because they all pledged that they would never vote for Nancy Pelosi to be the speaker. It's a real dilemma for her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Democratic House candidates this cycle, we don't even have the final tally, raised $1 billion. And that's 50 percent more than the Republicans raised.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, they definitely out-raised the Republicans this season as well.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm so glad I'm out of the business of raising money, I tell you that. I hated it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I bet. I bet. That's hard.</p><p>We have a lot coming up in all of the above. But let's get to our top story this hour. And that is President Trump reaching across the aisle to keep driving strong economic growth in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the American economic miracle going strong. It is a miracle. We're doing so well.</p><p>And I've said it at a lot of rallies. Some of you have probably heard it so much, you don't want to hear it again. But when people come to my office -- presidents, prime ministers, they all congratulate me, almost the first thing on what we've done economically because it is really amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment officer, Krishna Memani. Krishna -- good to see you.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS: Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you do -- you agree that the economy is amazing and doing well but you see a slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>MEMANI: Yes. I think the economy today is doing reasonably well. We are probably going to end up somewhere north of 3 percent for the year.</p><p>But I think the slowdown is already unfolding. So by the middle of next year, we are talking about getting back to close to 2 percent rather than 3 percent that we have seen in 2018.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think the slowdown is based only on higher interest rates? I mean the Fed left interest rates unchanged yesterday but it does look like we're going to see a rate hike in the month of December. Is that what's slowing things down or something else?</p><p>MEMANI: Well, that certainly is slowing things down a tad. But I think part of it is because the capital spending cycle that we expected -- the capital spending boost never materialized.</p><p>So for the economy to get to a higher level, we need higher level of productivity. And productivity is improving but not to the level that we need it to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've talked about this a lot -- Dagen. The cap -- one second, Mike -- I'm sorry. But the cap ex -- when the President rolled back and Congress rolled back all of those regulations earlier, you know, early in his administration, cap spending did increase. And we were like oh, businesses have been sitting on cash for 10 years, they're finally putting it to work.</p><p>Was it trade, do you think, the worries over steel and aluminum that stopped businesses to say wait, let me -- I'm not sure about this. I'm going to sit on cash again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hard to quantify but likely playing into that decision making because business expenditures in the first quarter, I think were up 11.5 percent.</p><p>MEMANI: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In the most recent quarter that we got, in the third quarter, they were up only eight-tenths of a percent. Can that -- is this just a momentary kind of waning because of the concerns about trade.</p><p>We've gotten the Canada and the Mexico deal done and these get ratified by Congress. There's movement with Europe. Is that really what's in the way? Or -- is it just a momentary pause heading toward the end of the year.</p><p>MEMANI: Look, I think from a cyclical standpoint in this cycle capital spending never got to the level that it has in the past. And I think the likelihood that will get there this late in the cycle is probably very small.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MEMANI: Having said that, the capital spending is higher at this point in the cycle than it was in the beginning. But it's not enough to get us to 3 percent growth rate, I don't think.</p><p>MURPHY: I'm going to push back a little bit here because for investors at home watching this, you know, trying to time the market, you know, I'm sure you heard the saying it's not timing the market, it's your time in the market. So to try to reallocate assets out of funds or if you're planning for a slowdown, I think it's very dangerous for people to start to take their retirement funds for instance and say well, I'm going to move over here, now reallocating on an active basis.</p><p>I would advise people watching at home that we're going to go through ups and downs in the market --</p><p>MEMANI: Sure.</p><p>MURPHY: -- but stay invested because investors will typically panic out at the wrong time like last month and then not know when to get back in.</p><p>MEMANI: I couldn't agree with you more. Far from telling people to get out of the market, you kind of go back and look at things. In this cycle the most amount of money that you have made is just being there, rather than being out of the market.</p><p>Our view right now is five more years. That is this cycle will probably last another three, four, five years. It's not ending in 2019 or 2020 that some people are forecasting.</p><p>At this point, there's enough momentum in the economy to carry us through for a long time. Inflation hasn't manifested itself. So absolutely stay in the markets. There's no reason to take your money home just yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about trade because the U.S. and China are locked in a stalemate over trade. Despite the tensions, October saw a reported 30 percent increase in Chinese exports to the United States from a year ago.</p><p>This a Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Washington today. So I want to ask you about the Chinese strategy. But first there's an article in the \"Journal\" today which is questioning this new house leadership and what that does for USMCA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're supposed to see this ratified by Congress as Dagen just noted in the New Year. Do the Democrats stop this? Do they force -- you know, just because they've taken over the House majority or is it all about the Senate?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's really hard to see where they're coming from as long as this leadership race is still in play. I don't think they take a hard position and go to the President and say this is what we need out of it. I don't think that happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think it gets ratified.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I do think it ultimately gets ratified because I think blue collar America wants it to happen.</p><p>MEMANI: I think it gets ratified for the simple reason that it's really good policy. I think free trade is a good thing. If you kind of go back and look at the Chinese data that you were talking about, at the end of the day trade hasn't really gone down meaningfully.</p><p>What has risen is basically tension in people's minds and that's kind of ending up taking away from capital spending that we need at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One thing to note is -- in this \"Wall Street Journal\" article that Maria mentioned -- the unions will put pressure on the Democrat to ratify this. This is a huge win for the auto workers in this country because it discourages auto manufacturers from moving production down to Mexico for cheap labor. It's a big win.</p><p>And quite frankly, the steel tariffs are a big win for the steelworkers of the country. So they've got a lot. So all it takes is maybe a couple of phone calls from the union leaders to Nancy Pelosi's office, I guarantee they get on board.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Donald Trump didn't become President Trump without those people swaying into his corner. They didn't believe where Hillary Clinton was on this. And even though it will give Donald Trump a victory, they have to go there and that's the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Richard Trumka joined us earlier in the week and just said exactly what you said, actually. That it was a good deal. And he really faced criticism from those outside the union.</p><p>So Krishna bottom line here, with all said, you're expecting this slowdown. Would you put your money to work in stocks?</p><p>MEMANI: Absolutely. Again, as I mentioned before, five more years. We expect the cycle to continue. There's still a lot of upside left in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even technology?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEMANI: Especially in technology.</p><p>MURPHY: We need tech leadership. And I think you're going to see it in the last two months of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We need tech leadership, why? Because that will confirm that this market is on firm footing.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. But also because that's where the growth is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: So you need growth to have -- that's the strong leadership. Otherwise you have weak leadership which will eventually fail.</p><p>MEMANI: Those companies are actually executing fantastically. So I think tech is going to remain the leader.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Is there any sector you don't like?</p><p>MEMANI: So I think the interest rate sensitive sectors is kind of in the walking around with an x on their back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like financials.</p><p>MEMANI: Financials, housing -- things like that, because the fed will continue to tighten for at least another six months. So I think there will be a time for that. But that's probably middle of next year rather than right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Krishna -- great to get your insights.</p><p>MEMANI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Krishna Memani, Oppenheimer there.</p><p>Coming up, searching for a motive -- families are mourning this morning after 12 people were killed in a bar shooting in southern California yesterday. We have the very latest from southern California.</p><p>And then Speaker Pelosi once again -- Nancy Pelosi's renewed confidence in getting that gavel back.</p><p>All next, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New details emerging this morning about the mass shooting in California in that bar yesterday. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is in Thousand Oaks, California this morning with the very latest. Jonathan -- good morning.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p>Hundreds of people turned out last night at a number of vigils to honor and remember the 12 people who were killed at the Borderline Bar and Grill, and to offer support to the victims' families.</p><p>Among those who died was a man whose mother says he survived the Las Vegas shooting massacre at a country music concert in October, 2017. Listen here to that distraught mother.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSAN SCHMIDT-ORFANOS, VICTIM'S MOTHER: My son was in Las Vegas with a lot of his friends and he came home. He didn't come home last night.</p><p>And I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control. And I hope to God nobody else sends me anymore prayers. I want gun control. No more guns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: Now, the gunman has been identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan.</p><p>We have obtained overnight disturbing video of the moments when he opened fire. Watch and listen here.</p><p>(VIDEO OF SHOOTING)</p><p>HUNT: He used a Glock-21 .45 caliber as his weapon of choice. It was legally bought, Maria, but it had an extended magazine, enabling him to fire more rounds. Those are illegal in California -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Jonathan -- thank you.</p><p>Jonathan Hunt in Thousand Oaks this morning.</p><p>We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, three massive wildfires across California to tell you about. Several firefighters injured while battling these blazes. The latest coming up.</p><p>Then hey Alexa, give me Insight -- how author and advocate Deepak Chopra is teaming jp with Amazon to fill your morning routine with positive vibes. He's here in studio.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Insights and inspiration from world renowned Dr. Deepak Chopra in the palm of your hand -- thanks to a partnership between the Web site Live Person and Amazon's Alexa.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA, AUTHOR: I have this little microphone attached to this little phone. And I just speak out to what I'm thinking and what my intention for the day is. And then it's recorded here and it goes to Live Person and then it's on Alexa. It's all done very efficiently and smoothly and it's part of my daily routine now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the author of the brand-new book, \"You are the Universe\" and alternative medicine advocate, Deepak Chopra. Great to see you -- Deepak. Thanks for being here this morning.</p><p>CHOPRA: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations. Tell us about this new venture.</p><p>CHOPRA: Well, for the last 40 years I've been sharing my insights or reflections, meditations with people. It started with friends, then family, then social media, and now Alexa.</p><p>It wasn't planned but you know, I start my day with a few reflections and intentions -- a joyful, energetic body, love and compassion in the heart, clarity of mind, lightness of being. Then I expand on that and somehow Alexa picks it up to Live Person.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us why that -- tell us why that's so important, the clarity that you try to have.</p><p>CHOPRA: I think setting an intention or even asking yourself a simple question like what do I want is enough. You don't have to actually concentrate on having a specific intention.</p><p>If you ask yourself, what do I want for me today or for the world or for my kids or -- you will already have a response there. That brings clarity to your intention. And if you start letting go and settle in your being, then that intention organizes its own fulfillment through synchronicity. That's a well-known spiritual tradition at least in the east.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that organizes you to deal with sort of the chaos of the day or the noise of the day.</p><p>CHOPRA: Yes. The noise of the day. You carry your peace wherever you go, no matter what.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The technology is pretty user-friendly as well.</p><p>CHOPRA: I think the technology is going to be the next phase of our evolution for higher consciousness, if we want it. Technology can be destructive, as you know. Anything you can do with technology -- including hack the elections or whatever. But technology can also create a more peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier and joyful world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how does technology change going forward? What do you see that could be possible?</p><p>CHOPRA: What we see as the Internet -- that's our global brain right now. So if I send an abusive tweet, let's say to somebody in Africa, I could give them high blood pressure just by doing that.</p><p>On the other hand, I send them an emoticon with a hug, it could give them a dopamine hit. So, you know, technology is bringing together the collective brain. And the Internet is the human condition. If we don't like what's happening in the world we have to change that interconnectivity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is Live Person looking to recruit other celebrities to partake in AI-powered conversation?</p><p>CHOPRA: I think they are, yes. They're already looking at other people, influencers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And maybe that will resonate with people to bring new people in.</p><p>CHOPRA: Yes. We need a critical mass of people who want a more peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier, and joyful world. That can only happen if we collectively have that intention and rewire our collective brain, which is the Internet. It's our brain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you do new intentions every day?</p><p>CHOPRA: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do those intentions come to you? Just depends on what you're looking for that day -- what do you want?</p><p>CHOPRA: I do a morning meditation which is always preceded by four questions. Who am I? What do I want? What's my purpose? And what am I grateful for? And then something comes up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That will lead you to your intention. Very good.</p><p>Tell us about book, \"You are the Universe\", the main theme.</p><p>CHOPRA: It's about the fact that we live in a human universe. What you see outside here is a human creation. But what we don't realize is even things like stars, galaxies and our own bodies are human concepts around perceptual experiences.</p><p>In other words, the world is not out there. It's in you. Your body is in you. Your mind is in you. By you, I mean the infinite consciousness that modifies itself as perceptions, thoughts, feelings, emotions.</p><p>So any experience you have, doesn't matter what the experience. It's either a sensation or a perception or an image or a feeling or a thought. Once you understand that, you can go back through the source, through meditation as you're doing right now, then that opens the door to creativity, insight, intuition, imagination -- everything else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gives you that clarity that you're looking for.</p><p>CHOPRA: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deepak -- thanks very much.</p><p>CHOPRA: Thanks, Maria, for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to talk with you as always.</p><p>CHOPRA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deepak Chopra.</p><p>Coming up, buying a home will cost you more.

And it is Friday, November 9th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Wall Street in the red this morning.

You can still find one, we've got it here, it may cost you a pretty penny, though. We're going to tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the battle for the gavel, House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi officially launching her bid for House speakership. And in an interview last night, she weighed in on her chances.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: What is your level of confidence that you'll be the speaker of the House?</p><p>SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: total.</p><p>CUOMO: 100 percent?</p><p>PELOSI: 100 percent.</p><p>CUOMO: Do you have any reservations about whether or not you want this in your life at this point?</p><p>PELOSI: No, none, whatsoever. I've had -- it's an urgency that I can't resist.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is The Weekly Standard deputy editor Kelly Jane Torrance. Kelly Jane, good to see you this morning. Is she a shoe-in for this?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: No, she is not, Maria. And you know, her confidence is impressive. You know, we talk a lot about big egos here in Washington and we always talk about men. But let's face it; women can have big egos too. And I think -- you know, very few in Washington have them as big as Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>You know, so they -- a bunch of -- about a dozen Democrats who do not want to see her as speaker. Again, actually, organized a call last night, trying to figure out how they can stop her. One of them was Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania who of course is -- you know, a moderate Democrat, recently ran and won his seat. Another was Tim Ryan of Ohio who actually had run against Pelosi in the past. He says he doesn't want to run this time but he's trying to find someone, anyone who will. And that might be actually the biggest problem for the Pelosi opponents is there doesn't seem to be a candidate that people are sort of getting behind and interested in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: And no one's -- no one's declared they want to run. And of course, I don't blame them because who wants to get on Nancy Pelosi's bad side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Well, they don't want to run but they don't want her to run. In fact, Tim Ryan joined me on Sunday, Congressman from Ohio, and I asked him if he's going to challenge her. I think he's actually more interested in challenging President Trump in 2020 but he did say he is not voting for Pelosi. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: After the 2016 election you wanted to unseat Nancy Pelosi to become speaker of the House. Are you running for Speaker of the House this time?</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO: We got a couple more days. There are a number of candidates that are having conversations that are talking about running. I will say it's not going to be a coronation. Somebody is going to run for leadership. I think it's important that we have this discussion and have this conversation. I think the American people want a change. I think a lot of Democrats want a change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RYAN: And so, we're going to have that discussion starting on Wednesday and let's hope we're having a conversation about speaker of the House and not leader of the minority party in Congress. But there's a lot of conversations happening right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jason Chaffetz is here, Kelly Jane. And you (INAUDIBLE) from the beginning, you don't think she has the votes.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's too many people that were on the record and remember, the very first vote that you cast as a member of Congress is who's going to be the next speaker. And you're going to ask these people like Lamb out of Pennsylvania to take that tough vote. So, I don't know how she gets to 218. But you're right, she certainly is confident.</p><p>But Kelly, I want to ask you, has leader McCarthy signaled what's going to happen in the next seven weeks? I mean, the Republicans are still in control in the House and Senate and the presidency for the next seven weeks. Have we seen what that agenda is going to be?</p><p>TORRANCE: No, we -- you know what, I've heard very little coming through. And you know, even Republicans are calling it a lame duck session, which you know, you think, you've got your last chance to do something and they don't seem very interested in taking it. I think they're a little more preoccupied and worried about what's going to come next.</p><p>Now, of course one of the things that Donald Trump has talked about upcoming in the House is the speaker run and he's of course tweeted that he really thinks the Democrats should have Nancy Pelosi. And I don't think that has helped her cause.</p><p>But you know, as you -- as you -- you know, it was funny because you had Tim Ryan on and talked about, Maria, you said he might want to run against President Trump. Well, he actually brought up Trump and Pelosi in the same sentence this week after the elections, saying that, pointing out that exit polls showed that Nancy Pelosi's negatives were on par with Trump's at 55 percent, he said. So, he's definitely trying to tie those two together. And we'll see how successful he is. But I mean, Jason, do you think there's anyone who's really ready to step up and challenge her?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I -- there's got to be somebody, somebody in that leadership team will actually change. And I think between the congressional black caucus, the Hispanic caucus. I think Lujan has a -- has a great case to make that he helped bring them back into power. In fact, that California and New York have so many members is going to be a problematic. But you basically see Democrats on the coast. You don't hear much about a Tim Ryan because there aren't as many Democrats in the middle part of the country and they certainly haven't gotten organized.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes and there's this fight, right, within the Democratic Party since they've gone lurching all the way to the left. And that's one of the issues.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we've got to get to the Florida Senate race. Because this is also one of the top stories. We've got to get your take on this situation, getting even tighter. Republican candidate Rick Scott filing explosive lawsuit against top election officials in two heavily Democratic counties. He detailed the allegations at a news conference yesterday. Watch this Kelly Jane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: I will not sit idly by why unethical liberals try to steal this election. Their goal is to keep mysteriously finding more votes until the elections turn out the way they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the same in Arizona Kelly Jane, your reaction?</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes, you know, I have to say, you know, Bill Nelson is trying to claim that -- you know, this is a politically motivated action by Rick Scott, by -- you know, getting law enforcement to investigate. Well, what's wrong with an investigation? What do you have to worry about? I thought Democrats were all in favor of investigations to find out the truth. And let's face it, Broward county, you know, Miami-Dade, recounts, we've heard about this before haven't we?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we have.</p><p>TORRANCE: And these are -- you know, heavily Democratic districts. And when you have suddenly votes being tallied and very quickly the margin changing from one where there wasn't going to be a recount to close enough where there were not only be a machine recount, there'd be a hand recount. You do have to worry about that.</p><p>Now, the deadline is Saturday noon for them to -- for the counties to file the election results. So, Rick Scott was in court. He's trying to get emergency hearings. So something can happen because of course, once you get that hand recount, again, these officials, it's a very heavily Democratic area and I don't blame him for being nervous. And you know, Arizona too, we saw very quickly all of a sudden margins changing, you know, within an hour we had -- you know, almost a percentage point I think.</p><p>So yes, you know, it's very nerve-racking. Especially with the Republicans, no matter what happens in these two races, looks like Republicans are going to hold the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: But of course, those margins matter a lot as we saw over the last year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Look, there were tens of thousands of votes difference going into this race in the previous recounts or previous times it was less than a thousand votes. So, there -- it really does something -- seem to be something suspicious here. And I think it was actually Senator Marco Rubio that was really pointing it out earlier in the day yesterday, if you go back and look at his tweets and what he was saying about the shenanigans that have been happening there in Florida. But you also have these allegations about how some of the counties in Arizona have been counting this too. And there is obviously a lot on the line.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF: And you know, it's crazy to me that we've talked so much about Russian meddling in our elections and now we don't need Russia, we're meddling in our own elections here. I mean, there have -- we have to use technology to make this voting process.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, now there are accusations of racism in Florida and Georgia and that's why Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams didn't win. Let me just point out that President Barack Obama won Florida two times and John James in Michigan lost. So is that racism?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It is interesting in Arizona because Governor Ducey was reelected by a very large margin. And the number of people that would have to take to vote for Ducey and then switch parties to vote for Krysten Sinema, that's a fascinating number. It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was incredible how close Sinema. I mean, now Sinema is in the lead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, he was campaign -- Doug Ducey was campaigning a lot with Martha McSally to at the very end. Trying to pull her across the line with him.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But who goes to the poll and votes Ducey, Sinema? That doesn't make a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it doesn't. And what about this, Michelle Obama ripping President Trump in her new book Becoming. She writes about the shock that she felt on election night when she learned that President Trump would succeed her husband, saying that she tries to, quote, block it all out. Kelly Jane, your reaction?</p><p>TORRANCE: You know, I'm trying not to laugh too hard. Block it all out. Well, you know, yes, she's upset that someone that replaced her husband is dismantling some of his legacy, and I sort of hate to use the word legacy because it hasn't been positive. I mean, look at how much the economy has gotten better since then.</p><p>And I -- you know, look at Iran. I mean, you had a president who is you know, sucking up to people who murder their own people for speaking out against the government and now we have someone who's standing with the people of Iran. So, yes, she has a right to be upset a little bit, I guess. But is this all -- is this book just a ploy? Is she going to run? What's the point of the book otherwise, right? It has to make a lot of money which you know, politicians like to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to add really quickly, you can look at the expression on Michelle Obama's face, the first lady's face on Inauguration Day. She was sick of Washington and it had nothing to do with right versus left, Republican versus Democrat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think she just wanted out of the political circles of D.C. I'll just throw that in there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Those were right, it's true, yes. Kelly Jane, go ahead. Final word.</p><p>TORRANCE: I was going to say, you know what, Dagen, great point, although, I think she likes to still be in the arena. I mean, she's made so many comments since then. I think, you know, she didn't like being in the -- you know, the everyday life, political life of D.C. But she likes to talk a lot of the big picture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, she wrote a book.</p><p>TORRANCE: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She wrote a book, Becoming. Kelly Jane Torrance, good to see you. Thank you so much. We will see you soon.</p><p>TORRANCE: Thank you, have a great weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you. Coming up, we've got a trio of wildfires burning across California, incredible pictures, injuring two firefighters. Take a look, the blazes forced thousands of people from their homes including Kim Kardashian among others. We're going to tell you her story when we come back.</p><p>And then, mortgage rates are surging to the highest level in nearly 10 years. It is taking a toll on the housing market. We'll tell you about it, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Three major wildfires burning out of control right now in California. Cheryl Casone with the headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, this is a fast-moving fire, Maria. It's forced evacuations in northern California. The camp fire has burned about 18,000 acres, destroying a number of structures, at least two firefighters and multiple civilians have been injured so far.</p><p>And then we're learning now that Kim Kardashian-West says that she was also forced to leave her home in the town of Hidden Hills. This happened last night, because of that fire. So she share this image on her Instagram said, in part I pray everyone is safe. But what's interesting is that she was taking those pictures out of her jet as she was coming home Maria, only to land and find out her own home was actually in danger.</p><p>So meanwhile, let's look at Southern California. Two wildfires have also triggered evacuations in Ventura County. The National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings throughout much of the state. Well, hopefully this fire gets under control today when the sun comes up in the California.</p><p>Another headline we're following, the cost of financing the purchase of a new home heading higher. The average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage jumped to 4.94 percent, that's the highest level in nearly eight years. Higher rates are -- priced many prospective home buyers out of the market. Existing home sales have fallen for the past six months. Rates are climbing of course, as the Fed is raising borrowing costs. They don't want the economy to overheat. But your mortgage might be a little more expensive.</p><p>All right, then there is this, Aldi's first ever wine Advent calendar may be sold out in stores but you can still get your hands on one. But it's going to frankly cost you a lot. The (INAUDIBLE) calendar, it's got 24 mini bottles of wine guys for $70.00. But now we're seeing it on eBay, huge markup, one just sold for $300, Maria. Plus $50.00 in shipping because it's super heavy as we just found out on our set as we tried to pick it up. It's 21 pounds. It's a wine calendar, it's got cheeses in it. And they're not going to restock it. So we got one on set but we can't open it because it's a hot property.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: We can open the cheese.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Well, OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't drink alcohol but (INAUDIBLE) I'll get the cheese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, let's see you open it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, why can't we open it though? I mean, I'm not talking about drinking it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let's open it and look at it.</p><p>CASONE: This is supposedly hot property. I know. So, here's how this works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Take the cheese out, OK.</p><p>CASONE: So, there's little mini bottles. Well, I'm just going to do it. If I get in trouble, well, I'll pay for it. All right, so, there's like one -- you know, 20 to 30 is the different day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to know how mini -- I want to know how mini these bottles are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because if it's only like a glass per bottle.</p><p>CASONE: Look at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok, so this is number --</p><p>CASONE: Well then, that's not bad if it's a mini bottle. Jason, you may have to help me open this. I can't get these open.</p><p>MURPHY: The one issue is that with the Advent calendar I like to do it in the morning. Like, kind of tough to open the wine and that could create a problem if you drinking the wine in the morning.</p><p>CASONE: All right, I can't get this open. People are telling me to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CASONE: Will you help me open it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm all about the cheese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's all about the cheese.</p><p>CASONE: I got the -- I'm trying to get the wine open. Can we just take a commercial break? (INAUDIBLE) not to open the wine is kind of a shock.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hang this on the wall and say kids, go get a piece of cheese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's like a gift.</p><p>CASONE: If you pay the $300 guys, not to self, get a knife or something to open it. But there's little mini bottles of wine and it's all different like Rose and Soras and Merlot and Cabs and all kinds of fun stuff, it's fun.</p><p>MURPHY: Great for the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I love the Advent calendar.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I have the Gouda.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It better be more than a glass a bottle.</p><p>CASONE: They're baby bottles. So, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Baby bottles (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: I'm going to work on this, I'm not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, honoring veterans in style. We're going to show you more of these crafts created by a pair of sisters who also support veterans through every stage of their business. Wait until you see this. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Support veterans and honor them every day, that is the mission behind the company Sword and Plough. And we like that mission right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Joining me right now are the sisters behind the company, CEO and former U.S. Army Captain Emily Nunez is here -- Emily Nunez Cavness along with co-founder and chief operating officer Betsy Nunez. Great to see you girls. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BETSY NUNEZ, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, SWORD AND PLOUGH: Thank you for having us, Maria.</p><p>EMILY NUNEZ-CAVNESS, CEO, SWORD AND PLOUGH: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm just -- you know, you just get me -- I mean, I'm in awe knowing that you are in Kandahar Afghanistan, what you've done, your father is one of the great vets as well. Thank you for your service.</p><p>NUNEZ: Thank you so much. We are just thrilled to be here, especially right before Veterans Day which is incredibly important to Sword and Plough our mission.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why is the company called Sword and Plough?</p><p>CAVNESS: So, it comes from the phrase to turns swords into ploughshares, which means to take a military technology and apply it to a peaceful civilian application. And that's really exactly what we're doing with our made in America products and repurposing thousands and thousands of military surplus into all of our designs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love this. And the last time you came you had lots of camo products. Now, you have little camo and tell me about what the products are this time.</p><p>CAVNESS: Sure, so we've got an assortment. We have everything from jewelry, necklaces, earrings made out of repurposed bullet casing, 50 caliber shell casing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nice. My goodness, you're kidding.</p><p>CAVNESS: Hand-hammered by an incredible female vet in Kentucky named Shana. And then we've got assortment of everything from bags to travel kits, essentially anything for you, a family member, loved one and they make perfect gifts for the holiday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the best selling item?</p><p>NUNEZ: Our best sellers are definitely our necklaces. They're just so one of a kind. They don't look anything like what they're made out of. This big 50 caliber shell casing, and so, that's been a big hit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell me how that's done with the casing?</p><p>NUNEZ: Sure, this amazing veteran named Shana is in Kentucky, and she actually hand hammers every single bullet casing into this beautiful pieces of jewelry. And she actually was a 50 caliber machine gunner when she was in the Army and when she was deployed in Afghanistan. So, it's an amazing full circle -- full circle experience.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is incredible.</p><p>CAVNESS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about the events you have on top this month.</p><p>CAVNESS: Yes, so, we're gearing up for Veterans Day, obviously, big this Sunday, and then gearing up for holiday season. But today, we're donating 10 percent of profits from any of the sales on our website SwordandPlough.com to bumper labs. And they do incredible work.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Friday.  It is Friday, November 9th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are on edge this morning.  Take a look at futures, indicating a  triple digit decline at the start of trading, down 130 points on the Dow,  down 16 on the S&amp;P, down 61 points on the Nasdaq -- almost 1 percent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a mixed story yesterday.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged as expected.  But some  thought the central bank would signal a dovish tone following the market  volatility last month.  We did not see that.</p><p>DowIndustrials were up 11 points.  S&amp;P 500 down 7.  Nasdaq down 39 at the  close yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning also under pressure.  FT 100 in London down  almost 1 percent.  The CAC 40 in Paris down better than 1 percent and the  DAX index in Germany down two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  Worst performer Hong Kong  better than 2 percent lower.</p><p>Meanwhile oil entering a bear market.  Oil prices are now down 20 percent  from their most recent high.  Why it could be a warning for what's to come  in the global economy.</p><p>Plus, madam speaker, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi standing firm that  she will get that gavel back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  I will be the speaker of  the people's House.  I feel very confident about where I am.  And I feel  very encouraged by the overwhelming support in my caucus that will go to  the floor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, she may still face a tough road to victory.  We're taking  a look at the race for house speaker this morning.</p><p>And a bomb shell lawsuit in Florida -- Rick Scott is alleging Democrats  were trying to steal the election.  The details later this hour as Florida  is looking at a recount.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Rosecliff CEO and  managing partner Mike Murphy; and former Utah Congressman, former House  Oversight Committee chairman and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz.  Good  morning.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  What a week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a week.  It's been an incredible week.  A lot of news and  we have a lot of open questions still.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  Yes.  From the firing of Jeff Sessions which we forgot to  mention earlier in the list of things to an amazing election to the  President traveling overseas.  He's got a lot on his plate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He's headed to Paris.  And we're going to probably see  him leave this morning.  What's on your mind?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But now with Florida and the --  again, we know that the Republicans will hold a majority in the Senate but  you have Sinema now leading McSally in the vote count in Arizona.  Florida  headed for a recount.  Some shenanigans going on according to Governor Rick  Scott there.</p><p>And so there's a lot of -- a lot is up in the air at this point.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Even the Georgia governor's race is still -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Even the Georgia's governor's -- that's right.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  My glass being half full, I'm  hoping that now we have some bipartisanship that somehow we get -- instead  of just everyone attacking everyone, we get some people working together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's why the markets I guess rallied.  Maybe markets  like the divided government -- 545 points higher on the Dow the day after  the midterms.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And you know, one, it took a lot of the uncertainty out.   But two, I think we sold off into the elections because we weren't sure  what the outcomes were going to be.  So getting some of that back.</p><p>But now, for the last two months of the year, we have to see if big tech  can resume its leadership in the market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know if I would cut a deal with somebody who is not  acting in your best interest.  I will say that about Washington, Jason  Chaffetz.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm trying to get to one over here.  I sat for two years when  Nancy Pelosi was the speaker, I didn't see an ounce of bipartisanship in  those two years.  So color me tainted but I've got to tell you, I sat there  and saw it for myself.</p><p>And I don't think -- she said she has the overwhelming majority but she  needs 218 people specifically to vote for her as speaker.  And she is not  there yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when I turned on the TV yesterday and I saw her at  the podium speaking and doing this long press conference, I said, it's  going to be a long couple of years.  She's going to be at that podium  talking about everything she wants.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But don't underestimate her though because I sat here repeatedly  and mocked and disparaged that crumbs comment about the $2,000 bonuses that  companies handed out but, you know what, she dropped that, didn't she.  And  she focused solely on the issue of health care.</p><p>Quite frankly, I think the Democrats and the messaging made that the number  one issue.  They preyed on people's fears about pre-existing condition  coverage and it helped them in the House, most definitely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she probably will get the job because of her fund raising  efforts.  Isn't she a master fundraiser -- Jason.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In the history of the United States Congress, the House and the  Senate, nobody has ever raised more money than Nancy Pelosi.  That's why  she's at the top of the heap.  But she's not the speaker yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see.  You're really skeptical she's going to  get that 218.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  She's going to put a couple of dozen members in jeopardy because  they all pledged that they would never vote for Nancy Pelosi to be the  speaker.  It's a real dilemma for her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Democratic House candidates this cycle, we don't even have  the final tally, raised $1 billion.  And that's 50 percent more than the  Republicans raised.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, they definitely out-raised the Republicans this  season as well.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm so glad I'm out of the business of raising money, I tell you  that.  I hated it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I bet.  I bet.  That's hard.</p><p>We have a lot coming up in all of the above.  But let's get to our top  story this hour.  And that is President Trump reaching across the aisle to  keep driving strong economic growth in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now is the time for members  of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the  American economic miracle going strong.  It is a miracle.  We're doing so  well. </p><p>And I've said it at a lot of rallies.  Some of you have probably heard it  so much, you don't want to hear it again.  But when people come to my  office -- presidents, prime ministers, they all congratulate me, almost the  first thing on what we've done economically because it is really amazing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment  officer, Krishna Memani.  Krishna -- good to see you.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS:  Good to see  you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you do -- you agree that the economy is amazing and doing  well but you see a slowdown on the horizon.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Yes.  I think the economy today is doing reasonably well.  We are  probably going to end up somewhere north of 3 percent for the year.</p><p>But I think the slowdown is already unfolding.  So by the middle of next  year, we are talking about getting back to close to 2 percent rather than 3  percent that we have seen in 2018.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think the slowdown is based only on higher interest  rates?  I mean the Fed left interest rates unchanged yesterday but it does  look like we're going to see a rate hike in the month of December.  Is that  what's slowing things down or something else?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, that certainly is slowing things down a tad.  But I think  part of it is because the capital spending cycle that we expected -- the  capital spending boost never materialized.</p><p>So for the economy to get to a higher level, we need higher level of  productivity.  And productivity is improving but not to the level that we  need it to be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've talked about this a lot -- Dagen.  The cap -- one second,  Mike -- I'm sorry.  But the cap ex -- when the President rolled back and  Congress rolled back all of those regulations earlier, you know, early in  his administration, cap spending did increase.  And we were like oh,  businesses have been sitting on cash for 10 years, they're finally putting  it to work.</p><p>Was it trade, do you think, the worries over steel and aluminum that  stopped businesses to say wait, let me -- I'm not sure about this.  I'm  going to sit on cash again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hard to quantify but likely playing into that decision making  because business expenditures in the first quarter, I think were up 11.5  percent.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the most recent quarter that we got, in the third quarter,  they were up only eight-tenths of a percent.  Can that -- is this just a  momentary kind of waning because of the concerns about trade.  </p><p>We've gotten the Canada and the Mexico deal done and these get ratified by  Congress.  There's movement with Europe.  Is that really what's in the way?   Or -- is it just a momentary pause heading toward the end of the year.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Look, I think from a cyclical standpoint in this cycle capital  spending never got to the level that it has in the past.  And I think the  likelihood that will get there this late in the cycle is probably very  small.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MEMANI: Having said that, the capital spending is higher at this point in  the cycle than it was in the beginning.  But it's not enough to get us to 3  percent growth rate, I don't think.</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm going to push back a little bit here because for investors at  home watching this, you know, trying to time the market, you know, I'm sure  you heard the saying it's not timing the market, it's your time in the  market.  So to try to reallocate assets out of funds or if you're planning  for a slowdown, I think it's very dangerous for people to start to take  their retirement funds for instance and say well, I'm going to move over  here, now reallocating on an active basis.</p><p>I would advise people watching at home that we're going to go through ups  and downs in the market -- </p><p>MEMANI:  Sure.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- but stay invested because investors will typically panic out at  the wrong time like last month and then not know when to get back in.  </p><p>MEMANI:  I couldn't agree with you more.  Far from telling people to get  out of the market, you kind of go back and look at things.  In this cycle  the most amount of money that you have made is just being there, rather  than being out of the market.</p><p>Our view right now is five more years.  That is this cycle will probably  last another three, four, five years.  It's not ending in 2019 or 2020 that  some people are forecasting. </p><p>At this point, there's enough momentum in the economy to carry us through  for a long time.  Inflation hasn't manifested itself.  So absolutely stay  in the markets.  There's no reason to take your money home just yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to ask you about trade because the U.S. and China are  locked in a stalemate over trade.  Despite the tensions, October saw a  reported 30 percent increase in Chinese exports to the United States from a  year ago.  </p><p>This a Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are  scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Washington today.  So  I want to ask you about the Chinese strategy.  But first there's an article  in the \"Journal\" today which is questioning this new house leadership and  what that does for USMCA.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we're supposed to see this ratified by Congress as Dagen  just noted in the New Year.  Do the Democrats stop this?  Do they force --  you know, just because they've taken over the House majority or is it all  about the Senate?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's really hard to see where they're coming from as long as  this leadership race is still in play.  I don't think they take a hard  position and go to the President and say this is what we need out of it.  I  don't think that happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think it gets ratified.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I do think it ultimately gets ratified because I think blue  collar America wants it to happen.  </p><p>MEMANI:  I think it gets ratified for the simple reason that it's really  good policy.  I think free trade is a good thing.  If you kind of go back  and look at the Chinese data that you were talking about, at the end of the  day trade hasn't really gone down meaningfully.</p><p>What has risen is basically tension in people's minds and that's kind of  ending up taking away from capital spending that we need at this point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to note is -- in this \"Wall Street Journal\" article  that Maria mentioned -- the unions will put pressure on the Democrat to  ratify this.  This is a huge win for the auto workers in this country  because it discourages auto manufacturers from moving production down to  Mexico for cheap labor.  It's a big win.</p><p>And quite frankly, the steel tariffs are a big win for the steelworkers of  the country.  So they've got a lot.  So all it takes is maybe a couple of  phone calls from the union leaders to Nancy Pelosi's office, I guarantee  they get on board.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Donald Trump didn't become President Trump without those people  swaying into his corner.  They didn't believe where Hillary Clinton was on  this.  And even though it will give Donald Trump a victory, they have to go  there and that's the President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard Trumka joined us earlier in the week and just said  exactly what you said, actually.  That it was a good deal.  And he really  faced criticism from those outside the union.</p><p>So Krishna bottom line here, with all said, you're expecting this slowdown.   Would you put your money to work in stocks?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Absolutely.  Again, as I mentioned before, five more years.  We  expect the cycle to continue.  There's still a lot of upside left in the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even technology?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEMANI:  Especially in technology.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We need tech leadership.  And I think you're going to see it in  the last two months of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We need tech leadership, why?  Because that will confirm that  this market is on firm footing.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  But also because that's where the growth is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  So you need growth to have -- that's the strong leadership.   Otherwise you have weak leadership which will eventually fail.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Those companies are actually executing fantastically.  So I think  tech is going to remain the leader.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Is there any sector you don't like?  </p><p>MEMANI:  So I think the interest rate sensitive sectors is kind of in the  walking around with an x on their back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like financials.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Financials, housing -- things like that, because the fed will  continue to tighten for at least another six months.  So I think there will  be a time for that.  But that's probably middle of next year rather than  right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Krishna -- great to get your  insights.</p><p>MEMANI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Krishna Memani, Oppenheimer there.</p><p>Coming up, searching for a motive -- families are mourning this morning  after 12 people were killed in a bar shooting in southern California  yesterday.  We have the very latest from southern California.</p><p>And then Speaker Pelosi once again -- Nancy Pelosi's renewed confidence in  getting that gavel back.  </p><p>All next, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New details emerging this morning about the mass shooting in California in  that bar yesterday.  Fox's Jonathan Hunt is in Thousand Oaks, California  this morning with the very latest.  Jonathan -- good morning.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p>Hundreds of people turned out last night at a number of vigils to honor and  remember the 12 people who were killed at the Borderline Bar and Grill, and  to offer support to the victims' families.</p><p>Among those who died was a man whose mother says he survived the Las Vegas  shooting massacre at a country music concert in October, 2017.  Listen here  to that distraught mother.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSAN SCHMIDT-ORFANOS, VICTIM'S MOTHER:  My son was in Las Vegas with a lot  of his friends and he came home.  He didn't come home last night.</p><p>And I don't want prayers.  I don't want thoughts.  I want gun control.  And  I hope to God nobody else sends me anymore prayers.  I want gun control.   No more guns.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT:  Now, the gunman has been identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a  U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan.</p><p>We have obtained overnight disturbing video of the moments when he opened  fire.  Watch and listen here.</p><p>(VIDEO OF SHOOTING)</p><p>HUNT:  He used a Glock-21 .45 caliber as his weapon of choice.  It was  legally bought, Maria, but it had an extended magazine, enabling him to  fire more rounds.  Those are illegal in California -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Jonathan -- thank you.</p><p>Jonathan Hunt in Thousand Oaks this morning.</p><p>We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, three massive wildfires across California to tell you  about.  Several firefighters injured while battling these blazes.  The  latest coming up.</p><p>Then hey Alexa, give me Insight -- how author and advocate Deepak Chopra is  teaming jp with Amazon to fill your morning routine with positive vibes.   He's here in studio.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Insights and inspiration from world renowned Dr. Deepak Chopra in the palm  of your hand -- thanks to a partnership between the Web site Live Person  and Amazon's Alexa.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA, AUTHOR:  I have this little microphone attached to this  little phone.  And I just speak out to what I'm thinking and what my  intention for the day is.  And then it's recorded here and it goes to Live  Person and then it's on Alexa.  It's all done very efficiently and smoothly  and it's part of my daily routine now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the author of the brand-new book, \"You  are the Universe\" and alternative medicine advocate, Deepak Chopra.  Great  to see you -- Deepak.  Thanks for being here this morning.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  Tell us about this new venture.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Well, for the last 40 years I've been sharing my insights or  reflections, meditations with people.  It started with friends, then  family, then social media, and now Alexa.</p><p>It wasn't planned but you know, I start my day with a few reflections and  intentions -- a joyful, energetic body, love and compassion in the heart,  clarity of mind, lightness of being.  Then I expand on that and somehow  Alexa picks it up to Live Person.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us why that -- tell us why that's so important, the  clarity that you try to have.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think setting an intention or even asking yourself a simple  question like what do I want is enough.  You don't have to actually  concentrate on having a specific intention.</p><p>If you ask yourself, what do I want for me today or for the world or for my  kids or -- you will already have a response there.  That brings clarity to  your intention.  And if you start letting go and settle in your being, then  that intention organizes its own fulfillment through synchronicity.  That's  a well-known spiritual tradition at least in the east.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that organizes you to deal with sort of the chaos of the  day or the noise of the day.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  The noise of the day.  You carry your peace wherever you go,  no matter what.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The technology is pretty user-friendly as well.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think the technology is going to be the next phase of our  evolution for higher consciousness, if we want it.  Technology can be  destructive, as you know.  Anything you can do with technology -- including  hack the elections or whatever.  But technology can also create a more  peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier and joyful world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how does technology change going forward?  What do you see  that could be possible?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  What we see as the Internet -- that's our global brain right now.   So if I send an abusive tweet, let's say to somebody in Africa, I could  give them high blood pressure just by doing that.</p><p>On the other hand, I send them an emoticon with a hug, it could give them a  dopamine hit.  So, you know, technology is bringing together the collective  brain.  And the Internet is the human condition.  If we don't like what's  happening in the world we have to change that interconnectivity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is Live Person looking to recruit other celebrities to partake  in AI-powered conversation?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  I think they are, yes.  They're already looking at other people,  influencers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And maybe that will resonate with people to bring new people  in.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  We need a critical mass of people who want a more peaceful,  just, sustainable, healthier, and joyful world.  That can only happen if we  collectively have that intention and rewire our collective brain, which is  the Internet.  It's our brain.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you do new intentions every day?  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do those intentions come to you?  Just depends on what  you're looking for that day -- what do you want?</p><p>CHOPRA:  I do a morning meditation which is always preceded by four  questions.  Who am I?  What do I want?  What's my purpose?  And what am I  grateful for?  And then something comes up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That will lead you to your intention.  Very good.</p><p>Tell us about book, \"You are the Universe\", the main theme.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  It's about the fact that we live in a human universe.  What you  see outside here is a human creation.  But what we don't realize is even  things like stars, galaxies and our own bodies are human concepts around  perceptual experiences. </p><p>In other words, the world is not out there.  It's in you.  Your body is in  you.  Your mind is in you.  By you, I mean the infinite consciousness that  modifies itself as perceptions, thoughts, feelings, emotions.</p><p>So any experience you have, doesn't matter what the experience.  It's  either a sensation or a perception or an image or a feeling or a thought.   Once you understand that, you can go back through the source, through  meditation as you're doing right now, then that opens the door to  creativity, insight, intuition, imagination -- everything else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gives you that clarity that you're looking for.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deepak -- thanks very much.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Thanks, Maria, for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to talk with you as always.  </p><p>CHOPRA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deepak Chopra.</p><p>Coming up, buying a home will cost you more.

I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, November 9th.   Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Wall Street in the red this morning.  Take a look, we're at the lows of the  morning right here with the Dow Industrials set to open down about 140  points, that's one half of one percent lower.  S&amp;P is down two thirds of a  percent and the NASDAQ with a 68 point decline, down almost one percent  right now.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected yesterday.   The markets were quiet.

Look at that.  Plus, thousands of residents fleeing  for their lives including Kim Kardashian, among others.  </p><p>Mortgage mess, home sales slowing down, mortgage rates surging to the  highest level in nearly a decade.  We've got the details on how much it is  costing now.  </p><p>And then, cheers to you, all these wine Advent calendars sold out fast.   You can still find one, we've got it here, it may cost you a pretty penny,  though.  We're going to tell you all about it coming up.  </p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the battle for the gavel, House  Minority leader Nancy Pelosi officially launching her bid for House  speakership.  And in an interview last night, she weighed in on her  chances.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN:  What is your level of confidence that you'll be  the speaker of the House?  </p><p>SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  total.  </p><p>CUOMO:  100 percent?  </p><p>PELOSI:  100 percent.  </p><p>CUOMO:  Do you have any reservations about whether or not you want this in  your life at this point?  </p><p>PELOSI:  No, none, whatsoever.  I've had -- it's an urgency that I can't  resist.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is The Weekly Standard deputy editor Kelly  Jane Torrance.  Kelly Jane, good to see you this morning.  Is she a shoe-in  for this?  </p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  No, she is not,  Maria.  And you know, her confidence is impressive.  You know, we talk a  lot about big egos here in Washington and we always talk about men.  But  let's face it; women can have big egos too.  And I think -- you know, very  few in Washington have them as big as Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>You know, so they -- a bunch of -- about a dozen Democrats who do not want  to see her as speaker.  Again, actually, organized a call last night,  trying to figure out how they can stop her.  One of them was Conor Lamb of  Pennsylvania who of course is -- you know, a moderate Democrat, recently  ran and won his seat.  Another was Tim Ryan of Ohio who actually had run  against Pelosi in the past.  He says he doesn't want to run this time but  he's trying to find someone, anyone who will.  And that might be actually  the biggest problem for the Pelosi opponents is there doesn't seem to be a  candidate that people are sort of getting behind and interested in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE:  And no one's -- no one's declared they want to run.  And of  course, I don't blame them because who wants to get on Nancy Pelosi's bad  side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, they don't want to run but they don't want her to  run.  In fact, Tim Ryan joined me on Sunday, Congressman from Ohio, and I  asked him if he's going to challenge her.  I think he's actually more  interested in challenging President Trump in 2020 but he did say he is not  voting for Pelosi.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the 2016 election you wanted to unseat Nancy Pelosi to  become speaker of the House.  Are you running for Speaker of the House this  time?  </p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  We got a couple more days.  There are a number of  candidates that are having conversations that are talking about running.  I  will say it's not going to be a coronation.  Somebody is going to run for  leadership.  I think it's important that we have this discussion and have  this conversation.  I think the American people want a change.  I think a  lot of Democrats want a change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RYAN:  And so, we're going to have that discussion starting on Wednesday  and let's hope we're having a conversation about speaker of the House and  not leader of the minority party in Congress.  But there's a lot of  conversations happening right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Jason Chaffetz is here, Kelly Jane.  And you (INAUDIBLE)  from the beginning, you don't think she has the votes.  </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, there's too many people that  were on the record and remember, the very first vote that you cast as a  member of Congress is who's going to be the next speaker.  And you're going  to ask these people like Lamb out of Pennsylvania to take that tough vote.   So, I don't know how she gets to 218.  But you're right, she certainly is  confident.  </p><p>But Kelly, I want to ask you, has leader McCarthy signaled what's going to  happen in the next seven weeks?  I mean, the Republicans are still in  control in the House and Senate and the presidency for the next seven  weeks.  Have we seen what that agenda is going to be?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  No, we -- you know what, I've heard very little coming through.   And you know, even Republicans are calling it a lame duck session, which  you know, you think, you've got your last chance to do something and they  don't seem very interested in taking it.  I think they're a little more  preoccupied and worried about what's going to come next.  </p><p>Now, of course one of the things that Donald Trump has talked about  upcoming in the House is the speaker run and he's of course tweeted that he  really thinks the Democrats should have Nancy Pelosi.  And I don't think  that has helped her cause.  </p><p>But you know, as you -- as you -- you know, it was funny because you had  Tim Ryan on and talked about, Maria, you said he might want to run against  President Trump.  Well, he actually brought up Trump and Pelosi in the same  sentence this week after the elections, saying that, pointing out that exit  polls showed that Nancy Pelosi's negatives were on par with Trump's at 55  percent, he said.  So, he's definitely trying to tie those two together.   And we'll see how successful he is.  But I mean, Jason, do you think  there's anyone who's really ready to step up and challenge her?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I -- there's got to be somebody, somebody in that leadership  team will actually change.  And I think between the congressional black  caucus, the Hispanic caucus.  I think Lujan has a -- has a great case to  make that he helped bring them back into power.  In fact, that California  and New York have so many members is going to be a problematic.  But you  basically see Democrats on the coast.  You don't hear much about a Tim Ryan  because there aren't as many Democrats in the middle part of the country  and they certainly haven't gotten organized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes and there's this fight, right, within the Democratic Party  since they've gone lurching all the way to the left.  And that's one of the  issues.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we've got to get to the Florida Senate race.  Because this  is also one of the top stories.  We've got to get your take on this  situation, getting even tighter.  Republican candidate Rick Scott filing  explosive lawsuit against top election officials in two heavily Democratic  counties.  He detailed the allegations at a news conference yesterday.   Watch this Kelly Jane.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R-FL), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I will not sit idly by why  unethical liberals try to steal this election.  Their goal is to keep  mysteriously finding more votes until the elections turn out the way they  want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the same in Arizona Kelly Jane, your reaction?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, you know, I have to say, you know, Bill Nelson is trying to  claim that -- you know, this is a politically motivated action by Rick  Scott, by -- you know, getting law enforcement to investigate.  Well,  what's wrong with an investigation?  What do you have to worry about?  I  thought Democrats were all in favor of investigations to find out the  truth.  And let's face it, Broward county, you know, Miami-Dade, recounts,  we've heard about this before haven't we?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we have.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  And these are -- you know, heavily Democratic districts.  And  when you have suddenly votes being tallied and very quickly the margin  changing from one where there wasn't going to be a recount to close enough  where there were not only be a machine recount, there'd be a hand recount.   You do have to worry about that.  </p><p>Now, the deadline is Saturday noon for them to -- for the counties to file  the election results.  So, Rick Scott was in court.  He's trying to get  emergency hearings.  So something can happen because of course, once you  get that hand recount, again, these officials, it's a very heavily  Democratic area and I don't blame him for being nervous.  And you know,  Arizona too, we saw very quickly all of a sudden margins changing, you  know, within an hour we had -- you know, almost a percentage point I think.  </p><p>So yes, you know, it's very nerve-racking.  Especially with the  Republicans, no matter what happens in these two races, looks like  Republicans are going to hold the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE:  But of course, those margins matter a lot as we saw over the  last year.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Look, there were tens of thousands of votes difference going  into this race in the previous recounts or previous times it was less than  a thousand votes.  So, there -- it really does something -- seem to be  something suspicious here.  And I think it was actually Senator Marco Rubio  that was really pointing it out earlier in the day yesterday, if you go  back and look at his tweets and what he was saying about the shenanigans  that have been happening there in Florida.  But you also have these  allegations about how some of the counties in Arizona have been counting  this too.  And there is obviously a lot on the line.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  And you know, it's crazy  to me that we've talked so much about Russian meddling in our elections and  now we don't need Russia, we're meddling in our own elections here.  I  mean, there have -- we have to use technology to make this voting process.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, now there are accusations of racism in Florida and Georgia  and that's why Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams didn't win.  Let me just  point out that President Barack Obama won Florida two times and John James  in Michigan lost.  So is that racism?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It is interesting in Arizona because Governor Ducey was  reelected by a very large margin.  And the number of people that would have  to take to vote for Ducey and then switch parties to vote for Krysten  Sinema, that's a fascinating number.  It doesn't seem to make a lot of  sense. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was incredible how close Sinema.  I mean, now Sinema is in  the lead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, he was campaign -- Doug Ducey was campaigning a lot with  Martha McSally to at the very end.  Trying to pull her across the line with  him.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But who goes to the poll and votes Ducey, Sinema?  That doesn't  make a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it doesn't.  And what about this, Michelle Obama ripping  President Trump in her new book Becoming.  She writes about the shock that  she felt on election night when she learned that President Trump would  succeed her husband, saying that she tries to, quote, block it all out.   Kelly Jane, your reaction?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  You know, I'm trying not to laugh too hard.  Block it all out.   Well, you know, yes, she's upset that someone that replaced her husband is  dismantling some of his legacy, and I sort of hate to use the word legacy  because it hasn't been positive.  I mean, look at how much the economy has  gotten better since then.  </p><p>And I -- you know, look at Iran.  I mean, you had a president who is you  know, sucking up to people who murder their own people for speaking out  against the government and now we have someone who's standing with the  people of Iran.  So, yes, she has a right to be upset a little bit, I  guess.  But is this all -- is this book just a ploy?  Is she going to run?   What's the point of the book otherwise, right?  It has to make a lot of  money which you know, politicians like to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to add really quickly, you can look at the  expression on Michelle Obama's face, the first lady's face on Inauguration  Day.  She was sick of Washington and it had nothing to do with right versus  left, Republican versus Democrat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think she just wanted out of the political circles of D.C.   I'll just throw that in there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those were right, it's true, yes.  Kelly Jane, go ahead.  Final  word.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  I was going to say, you know what, Dagen, great point, although,  I think she likes to still be in the arena.  I mean, she's made so many  comments since then.  I think, you know, she didn't like being in the --  you know, the everyday life, political life of D.C.  But she likes to talk  a lot of the big picture.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, she wrote a book.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She wrote a book, Becoming.  Kelly Jane Torrance, good to see  you.  Thank you so much.  We will see you soon.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Thank you, have a great weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.  Coming up, we've got a trio of wildfires burning  across California, incredible pictures, injuring two firefighters.  Take a  look, the blazes forced thousands of people from their homes including Kim  Kardashian among others.  We're going to tell you her story when we come  back.  </p><p>And then, mortgage rates are surging to the highest level in nearly 10  years.  It is taking a toll on the housing market.  We'll tell you about  it, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Three major wildfires burning out of control  right now in California.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this is a fast-moving  fire, Maria.  It's forced evacuations in northern California.  The camp  fire has burned about 18,000 acres, destroying a number of structures, at  least two firefighters and multiple civilians have been injured so far.  </p><p>And then we're learning now that Kim Kardashian-West says that she was also  forced to leave her home in the town of Hidden Hills.  This happened last  night, because of that fire.  So she share this image on her Instagram  said, in part I pray everyone is safe.  But what's interesting is that she  was taking those pictures out of her jet as she was coming home Maria, only  to land and find out her own home was actually in danger.  </p><p>So meanwhile, let's look at Southern California.  Two wildfires have also  triggered evacuations in Ventura County.  The National Weather Service has  issued red flag warnings throughout much of the state.  Well, hopefully  this fire gets under control today when the sun comes up in the California.</p><p>Another headline we're following, the cost of financing the purchase of a  new home heading higher.  The average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage  jumped to 4.94 percent, that's the highest level in nearly eight years.   Higher rates are -- priced many prospective home buyers out of the market.   Existing home sales have fallen for the past six months.  Rates are  climbing of course, as the Fed is raising borrowing costs.  They don't want  the economy to overheat.  But your mortgage might be a little more  expensive.  </p><p>All right, then there is this, Aldi's first ever wine Advent calendar may  be sold out in stores but you can still get your hands on one.  But it's  going to frankly cost you a lot.  The (INAUDIBLE) calendar, it's got 24  mini bottles of wine guys for $70.00.  But now we're seeing it on eBay,  huge markup, one just sold for $300, Maria.  Plus $50.00 in shipping  because it's super heavy as we just found out on our set as we tried to  pick it up.  It's 21 pounds.  It's a wine calendar, it's got cheeses in it.   And they're not going to restock it.  So we got one on set but we can't  open it because it's a hot property.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  We can open the cheese.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't drink alcohol but (INAUDIBLE) I'll get the cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, let's see you open it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, why can't we open it though?  I mean, I'm not talking about  drinking it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's open it and look at it.  </p><p>CASONE:  This is supposedly hot property.  I know.  So, here's how this  works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take the cheese out, OK.</p><p>CASONE:  So, there's little mini bottles.  Well, I'm just going to do it.   If I get in trouble, well, I'll pay for it.  All right, so, there's like  one -- you know, 20 to 30 is the different day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to know how mini -- I want to know how mini these bottles  are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because if it's only like a glass per bottle.  </p><p>CASONE:  Look at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, so this is number --</p><p>CASONE:  Well then, that's not bad if it's a mini bottle.  Jason, you may  have to help me open this.  I can't get these open.</p><p>MURPHY:  The one issue is that with the Advent calendar I like to do it in  the morning.  Like, kind of tough to open the wine and that could create a  problem if you drinking the wine in the morning.  </p><p>CASONE:  All right, I can't get this open.  People are telling me to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CASONE:  Will you help me open it.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm all about the cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's all about the cheese.</p><p>CASONE:  I got the -- I'm trying to get the wine open.  Can we just take a  commercial break?  (INAUDIBLE) not to open the wine is kind of a shock.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Hang this on the wall and say kids, go get a piece of cheese.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's like a gift.</p><p>CASONE:  If you pay the $300 guys, not to self, get a knife or something to  open it.  But there's little mini bottles of wine and it's all different  like Rose and Soras and Merlot and Cabs and all kinds of fun stuff, it's  fun.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Great for the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I love the Advent calendar.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I have the Gouda.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It better be more than a glass a bottle.  </p><p>CASONE:  They're baby bottles.  So, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Baby bottles (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm going to work on this, I'm not leaving.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, honoring veterans in style.  We're going to show you  more of these crafts created by a pair of sisters who also support veterans  through every stage of their business.  Wait until you see this.

Thank you for your service.  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Thank you so much.  We are just thrilled to be here, especially  right before Veterans Day which is incredibly important to Sword and Plough  our mission.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is the company called Sword and Plough?  </p><p>CAVNESS:  So, it comes from the phrase to turns swords into ploughshares,  which means to take a military technology and apply it to a peaceful  civilian application.  And that's really exactly what we're doing with our  made in America products and repurposing thousands and thousands of  military surplus into all of our designs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this.  And the last time you came you had lots of camo  products.  Now, you have little camo and tell me about what the products  are this time.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Sure, so we've got an assortment.  We have everything from  jewelry, necklaces, earrings made out of repurposed bullet casing, 50  caliber shell casing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice.

And then we've got assortment of everything from bags to travel  kits, essentially anything for you, a family member, loved one and they  make perfect gifts for the holiday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the best selling item?  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Our best sellers are definitely our necklaces.  They're just so one  of a kind.  They don't look anything like what they're made out of.  This  big 50 caliber shell casing, and so, that's been a big hit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell me how that's done with the casing?  </p><p>NUNEZ:  Sure, this amazing veteran named Shana is in Kentucky, and she  actually hand hammers every single bullet casing into this beautiful pieces  of jewelry.  And she actually was a 50 caliber machine gunner when she was  in the Army and when she was deployed in Afghanistan.  So, it's an amazing  full circle -- full circle experience.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is incredible.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about the events you have on top this month.  </p><p>CAVNESS:  Yes, so, we're gearing up for Veterans Day, obviously, big this  Sunday, and then gearing up for holiday season.

Happy Tuesday, everybody, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, May 21st, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retail earnings this morning, kicking into high gear, we've got Home Depot results coming in momentarily, what it means to the state of consumer and the economy today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is talking tough on China and on trade, the highlights from his Pennsylvania rally last night, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And easing restrictions on Huawei, the U.S. granting some exemptions to the blacklist on the Chinese technology and telecom giant, what it means for the trade negotiations, where are the exemptions, all of that, coming up.</p><p>Millions of Instagram influencers hit by a data breach, their personal information exposed. We have the details and a look at whether it can be prevented from happening to you.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news right now, Home Depot earnings are out better-than-expected, on the EPS line, right to Ashley Webster, we go with the numbers. Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We have a 227 on the EPS. The estimate was for 218, so a nice 0.9 cent beat there, Maria, on the revenue coming in it at $26.4 billion just above the estimate of 26.35, so a nice beat on the top and bottom line.</p><p>I'm just going through the comp sales here. Comp sales in the U.S. for Home Depot, up three percent, the company is saying it's very pleased with the underlying performance of the core business despite the unfavorable weather, the company says, in February.</p><p>For a full year, the same-store sales estimate coming in at up five percent, which is also in line with the last estimate that the company put out for the full year, so they haven't downgraded at all, on the same- store's percentages.</p><p>Let's see, four-year earning per share, up three percent, to $10.00 a share. So, all in all, this looks very positive but they do note that unfavorable weather, in February, did hurt sales some, but they're reaffirming their fiscal four-year outlook which will be gross revenue at around $111 billion for 2019.</p><p>So, overall, Maria, it seems like the Home Depot, hitting the numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but the stock is not doing much, so that's what I'm questioning here, what the company is saying about the guidance and the same-store sales, we'll take a look at that, because the stock is, right now, showing really a flat performance down a fraction, actually, Ashley, we'll get back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, it's not --it's not blowing out numbers but it isn't missing them either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it has turned around now. It is up half a percent.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Ashley Webster --</p><p>WEBSTER: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- with the latest there. I want to bring in E-Valuator Funds Chief Investment Officer, Kevin Miller, get some reaction here. Overall, I know Home Depot is not one of the companies you necessarily follow, but broadly speaking, in terms of the earnings back drop, what can you tell us?</p><p>KEVIN MILLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, E-VALUATOR FUNDS: Yes. Home Depot has -- it's a good company, in fact, it has, you know, when you look at individual stocks, you're looking for companies that have a good (INAUDIBLE) in fact, they're good protection from other entities coming in to compete with them, and then their cash flow, you know, what kind of free cash flow they're generating.</p><p>They're a huge -- the largest provider in the retail space, so we look at Home Depot as being a good alternative to -- if you're looking to get into retail, they would be a good stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's driving markets, right now, from your standpoint?</p><p>MILLER: Well, markets, right now, are kind of going sideways as a result of just the uncertainty of the China agreement. I think we're going to start seeing a slowdown in guidance, coming from corporations, going forward with earnings. We've seen decent earnings.</p><p>The tailwind that we've had as a result of the tax breaks, that's becoming more of a breeze. I mean, we're still getting some momentum because the consumer is still healthy with regard to additional disposable income to spend.</p><p>But the uncertainty that's in the -- in the marketplace as a result of the trade agreement is going to slow things down a little bit. I think we're going to see more volatility. It could actually be decent for the market, intermittently, and that corporations come out and they guide lower, and as a result, they have earnings surprises.</p><p>So, I think we're going to see increase volatility right between quarterly earnings reports, so we could see some loan performance and then we'll see some surprises. The next thing I'd like to see the Fed do is just to continue their unwinding. They came very, very close to overshooting with their raises, as of last December.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they sure did. We're going to get the FOMC minutes this week --</p><p>MILLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To give us a sense of what's on the Fed's mind. Would you expect a cut for the next move from the Federal Reserve, or just continue the wind down and do what you're doing?</p><p>MILLER: Yes. What -- in the E-Valuator Funds, it's kind of -- we invest in fixed income and in equities, and so in our fixed income, we have pivoted from credit-based yield and convertibles into longer duration, higher quality.</p><p>So we are expecting the Fed to stay where it's at, if not, cut. Now, if this trade agreement would've come to fruition, i could've seen the actual next move being a raise. I don't think you're going to see any Fed action in 2020 just because it's an election year, and that's kind of -- it's -- you don't that, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MILLER: You know, unless they do need a cut, but we don't expect any significant movement until they discontinue the unwinding of their (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the firm is largely fixed income. What about stocks? We've got markets, this morning, trading up. Look at Futures indicating a gain of 133 points this morning, after markets were lower yesterday. Obviously, this China trade is rattling investors.</p><p>But it feels, to me, like the markets are supportive and giving this President the benefit of the doubt, otherwise, I think we would have seen a much bigger selloff.</p><p>MILLER: Absolutely. I miscommunicated. We have six investments and each of them has some allocation to fixed income are more conservative one, obviously, has more. So, we do invest in equities in all 6, and I agree 100 percent. When you look at the stock market, you look at fundamentals.</p><p>And emotions and fundamentals can drive the market. The fundamentals have been strong, emotion, uncertainty, has been picking up. So that's why we are seeing this slowing down in growth that we've experienced.</p><p>But you look at unemployment, it's great, you look at inflation, it's great, you look at initial unemployment claims are low, you look at housing permits are doing very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MILLER: So, the fundamentals are strong, consumer confidence is good, we don't see a reason for any significant pull back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MILLER: Even though since 1980, if you look at the average pullback (INAUDIBLE) pullback, the average is about 13.9 percent drop. So, we will have a period, this year, where we will have a significant drop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>MILLER: And that's just an opportunity to get in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it doesn't -- it doesn't feel like that right now, to you?</p><p>MILLER: No, no, not at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, the President was touting the economy (INAUDIBLE) backdrop in Pennsylvania last night, at a rally, and he also touched on the relationship with China, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our spirit is strong, our stride is back, and our stand is clear, we are finally putting, like I said, America, first.</p><p>The United States added 263,000 jobs just last month, far exceeding any expectations. We will soon be taking in over $100 billion in tariffs. And remember this, they subsidize their product, people are moving from China now to go to areas that aren't tariffed.</p><p>We're going to build places in Pennsylvania and others rather than like the old days, remember the old days? We actually made our own product, OK? We made our own product.</p><p>Very expensive for China, they're not happy, but that's OK, it'll all work out.</p><p>What they've done to us is indescribable, economically. We have rebuilt China. They've done a great job, and I don't blame China. I don't blame President Xi. I don't blame them. Look, we allowed it to happen, our leaders allowed it to happen. Well, it's not happening anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because, initially, people thought that a deal had to happen, but now, China's behavior, the national security risk, as well as the economic opportunity and risks are -- it's resonating with the broader public.</p><p>MILLER: Real quickly, I think President Trump stopped the printing press in China. And the printing press is their history books, where they're going to, in five years, say, this is how China took over the globe without firing a shot.</p><p>I.P. theft, acquisition of mineral rights throughout Africa, Huawei information gathering, there was a system in place. And you know what, if they won't negotiate with us now, when they're an emerging market, they're a smaller economy than us, how do you think they would negotiate with us in 5 to 10 years, when they're bigger than us, they are a developed economy.</p><p>So, what we are doing now, we have to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: And we just have to work our way through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree with you. And, you know, that isn't even taking into account the national security risks, the way China is putting on, you know, military bases throughout the world, setting up islands, putting military bases there, really trying to compete with the U.S. military which is incredible. Not so fast, today, but at some point, maybe. Kevin, it's good to have you. Thank you.</p><p>MILLER: Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for weighing in, Kevin Miller, joining us there.</p><p>We want to tell you about this, Dish Network is under pressure this morning, the stock has been selling off all night, Cheryl Casone with the details there, big story here, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It really is, Maria, and good morning, so shares of Dish coming up a six percent decline from yesterday, to your point, down six percent in the premarket. Investors worried about this proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, that that can possibly hurt Dish's sale of (INAUDIBLE) spectrum.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile appear to be gaining traction in that merger. The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Chairman of the FCC says he will back the deal if the companies agree to certain concessions. Two more stocks you want to watch today.</p><p>Well, American Airlines is suing its Mechanics' Union, accusing them of staging a slowdown that's caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations and delays since February. American charges that the Mechanics are using the downshift for leverage in their contract talks.</p><p>Now, Americans also warning the slowdown to cause trouble for the summer travel season which starts this Friday. There is the year to date chart, as you can see, on American.</p><p>And you may have to get to the airport extra early this summer, get this, an airline group sees summer air travel going hit a record this year, and that's even with the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft.</p><p>Airline, anticipating more than 257 million passengers between June 1st and August 31st that would be up more than three percent from last summer's record, and with the 737 Max, Maria, it's only about 0.5 percent of the aircraft that's flying in the air around the globe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASONE: So, keep that in mind as you see the packed airport that you're about to enter into this summer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Cheryl, thank you. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, Huawei restrictions have been eased a bit, we're going to tell you about the reprieve the government is offering, the U.S. offering temporary relief to the ban against the Chinese tech and telecom giant, what it means for trade negotiations, coming up.</p><p>And then, big changes coming to Whole Foods, we've got those details right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have a big show this morning. Coming up, Senate Armed Services Committee Member, Senator Joni Ernst is here, a lot to talk about with her between China and Iran, Pennsylvania Congressman Dan Meuser, joining us this morning.</p><p>France Business Chairman, Ambassador Pascal Cagni is here, to talk about Europe and a lot around that, Crunch Fitness CEO, Keith Worts, joining us this morning, coming up. Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big show coming up.</p><p>And we want to focus, right now, on Huawei. The U.S. government is temporarily easing some trade restrictions which were imposed just last week, on Huawei Technologies.</p><p>The order expected to be published tomorrow, will give some suppliers and customers, a 90-day reprieve, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, GOP Strategist John Thomas and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you know, this Huawei reprieve is interesting, and I think all you really have to look at is that the performance of some of these stocks that were the suppliers to Huawei, and look at how they got killed in the last couple of days, like, Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcom, your reaction to this, Lindsey?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: (INAUDIBLE) yesterday was one, like, guidance for the year, so they're taking action. And it's interesting that this is all happening a week after the (INAUDIBLE) is put into place, or the sanctions are put into place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because they saw the reaction.</p><p>BELL: Exactly. And I think that maybe it's a tough arm tactic to really get China to the table to, you know, show them what we can really do and the impact that Trump has on their economy over there, because this is what --</p><p>Well, Huawei is the golden crown, the crown jewel over there. There are other ways that he can really impact the manufacturing business, he can prevent manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers from selling their equipment.</p><p>Semiconductor's chips, that is where this country really wants to take off, they need to make -- start making chips themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BELL: -- to excel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I -- go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was going to say, because you pointed this out, repeatedly, that you cannot separate these issues from one another, again, protecting our intellectual property and the thievery by China, in addition to trade talks and coming to agreement, in terms of improving our exports to that country.</p><p>It's all one big thing. And this is clearly a way of trying to bring China back to the table. I'm talking about the exemptions --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: --of giving them a reprieve and saying, OK, we'll take some time, but this is part of the trade negotiations.</p><p>JOHN THOMAS, GOP STRATEGIST: The news is tightening around Huawei, and the move here really is, it's not about Huawei, to me, it's about the suppliers, and it's also about the people who rely on Huawei's technology. Give them time to find something else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. Because you saw how investors reacted to the selloffs in the U.S. companies because they are the supplier to Huawei. But I don't know how they changed the behavior of Huawei. I don't think that happens. I mean, this is espionage at its best, and this is state- owned.</p><p>Huawei is something I focused on for a long time for that reason. Take a look back at some of the comments over the last couple of months that we've gotten from, for example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, A.I. Expert, the former President of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee, and then we had Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy, on himself. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: China is using technology in ways that will fundamentally put Americans at risk, this technology from Huawei that is now being put in place all across the world.</p><p>It's a company that's very close to the Chinese government and will do what the Chinese government asks them to do. And so we have sounded the alarm, urging nation's security apparatuses from around the world, not to put this technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you worry that there is sort of a score on people in China?</p><p>KAI-FU LEE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SINOVATION VENTURES: I think, the idea of using credit score exists in a lot of countries. In the U.S., there are scores that are run by the equivalent of Equifax. It's just that, I think, in China, it's perhaps more ambitious, I think, at this point. It's not different from an Equifax, but I think in the future, it may go further, but it's also culture-dependent.</p><p>ANDY PURDY JR., CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: On the theft of intellectual property by the China government, that's not us. The China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government.</p><p>The China government does not need to hack into Huawei's products to be able to conduct the spying that they want to do around the world, just as they did when they hacked into the Office of Personnel Management a few years ago and stole all of our personal records.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Huawei, defending itself, there, Andy Purdy was. But it's impossible to think that you're not going to get the behavior of the Chinese government when you've got the Chinese communists on the board of directors of Huawei.</p><p>The chairman was part of the Communist Party and it's still very active at Huawei. So these are the kinds of issues that is surrounding this company.</p><p>THOMAS: Well, you've got to remember; Huawei sells more smartphones than Apple. I mean, this is significant, although, it's being eased on Huawei right now. Let's not forget, Google just struck a major blow to Huawei, not allowing Huawei to deal on certain apps which will hurt their smartphone market no matter what --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this was a really important telling move that Google also, you know, took a step back because Google has been all in on China to the extent that it wasn't all in with the U.S. government, walking away from that Pentagon program and, in fact, helping the Chinese military, so that was a really important step, I think, that was -- that said a lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I want to just point out yesterday that we had a Department of Homeland Security warning about drones in this country that Chinese-made drones might be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China.</p><p>And the vast majority of drones used in the United States are made in (INAUDIBLE) or actually made by this company, nearly 80 percent of the drones used in the U.S. and Canada, come from DJI, which is in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm really glad you mentioned that. This is resonating.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I think that, at least, the world is waking up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It started with the Trump administration's focus on China and the theft --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and the espionage --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and now, a front -- they're putting it front --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll be right back</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Privacy and big tech, the personal contact information of millions of Instagram influencers, released online, in a database, open for the public to see. The leak affected more than 49 million records.</p><p>This comes as Microsoft is issuing a warning that a computer bug, the company recently found, could be used and exploited by malicious software, joining me right now is the CEO of Proofpoint, Gary Steele, and Gary, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>And your products obviously include compliance solutions, security solutions for companies, why are we seeing so many breaches today?</p><p>GARY STEELE, CEO, PROOFPOINT: I think the reality is that (INAUDIBLE) landscape is incredibly complicated and (INAUDIBLE) they're getting people's private information and they're financially benefiting from that.</p><p>BELL: So there's this trend now for a lot of companies to move their databases into the Cloud.</p><p>STEELE: For sure.</p><p>BELL: AWS, Amazon is one of the biggest providers, how does that impact cybersecurity? Is it safer in the Cloud or is it better to have your stuff on the databases on premises?</p><p>STEELE: Well, the Cloud is a -- is a really important infrastructure move for most companies. So, they are getting rid of all that information that is traditionally been on (INAUDIBLE) they're putting in the Cloud that cybercriminals are following them.</p><p>And so, it's an easy way to target companies and their employees. The information is super critical, moving the Cloud, and could be hacked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You recently made an announcement that you were acquiring Meta Networks, provider of zero trust network access solutions, $120 million there. Tell us about that acquisition, what it does in terms of strengthening your ability to help and, you know, put these breaches at rest.</p><p>STEELE: Yes. And we are super excited about it. So, what Meta does, is it allows a company to put policy around where individuals within the company and contractors can go. So, you basically can say you can only have access to one application or multiple applications, et cetera, and it really limits and better protects individuals within companies.</p><p>THOMAS: What advice are you giving your customers that are Cloud -- that are based in the Cloud, is it just don't use the same password for all of your different devices, is it change it with frequency, or is just -- is it one of those things that there's nothing we can do, that it's up, you know, the Cloud gods to protect their system for us?</p><p>STEELE: I think there a lot that companies can do. And I think, you know, what we recommend is that -- companies take a people (INAUDIBLE) approach. Look who is more vulnerable. Put controls in place that ensures that those specific people, if they are targeted, are going to be well protected.</p><p>So, it can be everything from training people to know what to click on or not to click on, to two factor authentication. There are a lot of actions that companies can take, because you can't give up.</p><p>THOMAS: And that seems to be the problem because there's so many (INAUDIBLE) in these large organizations that just aren't going to understand what not to click.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEELE: One of the things we sell and help companies do is, raise the awareness of their employees so that people know what to click on and what not to click on.</p><p>BELL: Business is booming, though, 20 percent revenue growth, free cash flow, 20 percent, that's what every investor's dream is.</p><p>STEELE: Yes. We're really focused on this balance between growth and cash flow, and we think that that's -- that profile is what investors want, and we've had great sustainable growth over long period of time and increasing cash flow which we think gives us long term durability as a company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gary, it's great to have your insights. Thanks so much.</p><p>STEELE: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gary Steele, joining us there. And Lindsey, you made a point earlier that the U.S. is trying to do a number of things to try to offset the loss of Huawei, but also make sure that we get coverage in some of these places that maybe Huawei is, in the rural areas, do you think that was probably behind the approval from the FCC yesterday?</p><p>BELL: Yes. I thought the timing of the FCC approval of the Sprint, T- Mobile deal was very interesting, because Huawei's equipment is used in rural areas and those two, combined, are going to have a great presence in the rural areas and they have commitments in three to six years to really get wireless telecommunications ability to that region.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's interesting that that happened yesterday, and then today, we get this list of exemptions on Huawei, as the U.S. is trying to figure, but also, keep Huawei banned in the country. Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Coming up, U.S.-Iran relations, I'll be speaking with one lawmaker, as the national security officials head to Capitol Hill for a briefing later today on the threat of Iran. And then the Eiffel Tower evacuated, why the French landmark was temporarily closed to visitors, that's next, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, May 21st. Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Retail earnings are in focus this morning. Home Depot reporting better than expected earnings and revenue. To stock up a $1.05 right now, that's one half of one percent. $192 where Home Depot shares.</p><p>All right now, it is a Dow component, it is not having much effect on Futures. We were looking at a rally before the numbers came out. We remain looking at a higher start to trading this morning. The Dow Industrial set to open up about a 128 point, 2-1/2 of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P futures are up 16 and the Nasdaq futures are higher by 66. This actually declines across the board yesterday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the hardest hit amid the Huawei blacklist, as we told you earlier, a number of high tech stocks getting -- taken a hit yesterday on the Huawei news, because their suppliers turf Huawei.</p><p>And the markets yesterday were down 84, and the Dow down 19 on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq was down 114 points, 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>European indices this morning are looking better, take a look, higher across the board, FT-100 up 52 or three-quarters of a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 31, and the DAX index in Germany higher by 122 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look the Shanghai Composite was up better than one and a quarter percent. As you can see, the others mixed. Whole Foods going green in a new way. We will tell you how.</p><p>And the most famous monument in Paris shut down. A man was arrested for trying to scale the Eiffel Tower. Yes, there he is.</p><p>Spring is in the air but it does not feel like that in Colorado this morning. There is a deep freeze going on complete with snow. We will take you there.</p><p>First, our top story this half an hour, rising tensions with Iran. The country quadrupling its production of enriched uranium. Iranian officials stressing that it would be usable for a power plant, not an atomic weapon. Tehran setting a July 7th deadline for Europe to set new terms for a deal or it will enrich closer to weapons-grade levels, it says. So, they're threatening Europe.</p><p>Yesterday, President Trump spoke about this and the tough stand he's got on Iran right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen, but if it does, it will be met obviously, with great force. We'll have no choice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House is set to brief Congress on the Iran Threat today. Joining me right now is Iowa Senator, Senate Judiciary, Agriculture, and Armed Services Committee member Joni Ernst.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): Good morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you characterize the threat of Iran right now? It does to have things worsen?</p><p>ERNST: We do have a briefing today. So, we will learn more about that particular threat, but yes, certainly, there has been an imminent threat for our president to evacuate our embassy in Baghdad. It's pretty significant.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know that you made a statement on China which is the other big story right now. And I want to talk to you about trade, as well as the national security risks. The White House pushing for the passage of U.S. USMCA, saying it will boost economic growth and create jobs as the US- China trade battle goes on. Before we get into China, do you expect USMCA to pass?</p><p>ERNST: I do. I do, I am very hopeful. But now the pressure is on the House to make sure that it is moving. So, we will keep encouraging our constituents to reach out to our delegations in the House, put the pressure on Speaker Pelosi to actually honor her obligation in passing and as -- so we can get this ratified quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you know, the Speaker has said she's not sure if it's actually even going to come to the floor. I mean, I know it will probably pass if it comes to the floor, but is it even possible that she wouldn't bring it to the floor this year?</p><p>ERNST: Well, she needs to bring it to the floor, and she needs to encourage her members to be supportive of this deal. We've worked very hard and long on this. And in Iowa, it's very important, one in five jobs in Iowa is tied directly to trade. And Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. So, we do want to make sure that we're good trade partners to our neighbors.</p><p>We have seen the tariffs -- the 232 tariffs removed by the president, he did that last Friday. Very supportive of his actions, now we need to move on the USMCA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and your constituents are getting impacted by all of this. We want to talk about broadband for rural America. You are part of a bipartisan effort to increase access to the high-speed Internet in rural areas. And we know that in certain rural areas of this country, Huawei is being used.</p><p>ERNST: Right, exactly. And through this bill, we're able to help these smaller rural telecom companies with regulation. There are so many overwhelming burdensome regulations coming from the federal government that can't apply to larger companies, but it's detrimental to these small rural telecom companies.</p><p>One company that I heard from in Northeast, Iowa, annually if it had to file with the SEC, it would cost about $800,000 to $1 million. That's pretty significant for folks in the rural areas. So, if we can help ease that burden certainly we'd love to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, will you be able to pick up the lost -- the lost communication as a result of Huawei? How does the Huawei ban and now today's reprieve -- temporary reprieve impact your constituents in rural America?</p><p>ERNST: Well, certainly it will be tough, but we will find a way. We certainly need to move away from China, we need to move away from Huawei in these areas. And the president is very encouraging. So, I think that we will find a way, we will continue developing here in the United States, and we'll make it much easier for our folks in rural America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we were having a conversation earlier -- Dagen and I about this China partnership. And for a long time, many people looked at this as just an economic story in a trade story. But there are real national security risks having to do with China, whether it's Huawei or their behavior elsewhere in terms of their efforts to try to overtake the U.S. military.</p><p>Give us your sense of the national security risks around China, and what can be done about it. And how important a trade deal is in all of that, and tariffs.</p><p>ERNST: Yes, absolutely. I always look at trade and I look at national security, they go hand-in-hand. China needs to be a good trade partner with us, they have treated the United States horribly for many years with the theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfers, and the utilization of many of their products is a national security risk when we look at technology.</p><p>So, we do need to move away from those products we need to make sure that China is a fair trade partner, and all of that the president has been working very hard on. We will be visiting with Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. trade rep today at our luncheon. And we expect to hear a lot more about China coming from Mr. Lighthizer today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Senator, its Dagen McDowell. You won that seat in the Senate running on the fact that you come from a family that raised hogs. And I remember that ad very well, what is going on with the hog farmers in your state, and the farmers who were very negatively impacted with the fight with China over this trade deal?</p><p>ERNST: This has been very, very hard on our hog farmers and our soybean farmers. Of course, the tariffs around China make it difficult on those producers. And I have heard from a number of those farmers.</p><p>One hog farmer, in particular, he and his young wife, they had hoped to take over their father's operation, and he stated, I can't do that now, I've had to take off-farm employment to make ends meet.</p><p>The tariffs have been very, very detrimental to them, very hard. That's why we need a deal with China soon. But you know what, the president, he is doing the right thing, and was China that backed away from these negotiations.</p><p>We have moved along so well, and then, China basically went back on everything that they had agreed to. So, the president is using the tariffs as leverage, but I'm telling you, our farmers are feeling the pinch. We'd like to see these done soon -- these trade deals done soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, if they don't agree to national security issues in terms of the theft of I.P., as far as other behavior. The monitoring of all of its citizens including Americans. I mean, can you actually do a trade deal when you've got these other open questions? Or do you need them to make that Chinese law, which initially, they had -- I guess said they would, and then reneged on?</p><p>ERNST: Yes, and I believe that they need to move ahead with that. China needs to honor its obligations, and it can't just be just a regulation, it does need to be codified.</p><p>The Chinese decided they didn't want to do that at the last minute. But we need to push them further. We have a strong healthy economy, it is really doing quite well. The Chinese are not doing as well. And so, we hope that we can bring them to the table. Let's agree to trade agreement. Let's move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>ERNST: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Joni Ernst, there. Meanwhile, Whole Foods ditching plastic straws among other things. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Such a trend with plastic straws. Whole Foods has yet decided to drop the straws in its stores in the United States, U.K., and Canada all this summer. Instead, they're going to offer paper straws at the juice and coffee bars, they'll start that in July.</p><p>Whole Foods also planning to replace hard-plastic cases for those (INAUDIBLE) and chickens with bags made up of 70 percent less plastic. Take a look at shares of Whole Foods for an Amazon, higher in the premarket. As you can see at more than one percent.</p><p>Well, big news this morning. The Eiffel Tower in Paris is now back open. After a man scale the iconic landmark and it caused six hours of chaos yesterday there. More than 2,500 tourists had to be evacuated. Police eventually convinced the guy to surrender just as he was approaching the peak of the nearly 1,100-foot tower. Unclear how the climber got past security, or why he decided to climb the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>And there is this Jeopardy's reigning champ, making quite an impression, rocking up a 23rd straight win. He was back yesterday, big news, James Holzhauer, won nearly $1.8 million thus far. This puts him third in all- time winnings. He is going to be back on tonight. People are now starting to analyze, Maria, his strategy on the Internet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, the way that he's putting down his really -- you know, intensive bets and he's aggressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool. What makes somebody scale the Eiffel Tower? I mean, what -- I don't know what this guy was thinking.</p><p>BELL: When if he's almost at the top, must to let him finish.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about the guy that scaled the Trump Tower.</p><p>THOMAS: Or (INAUDIBLE) the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it would get you one thing or arrested.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Coming up, burning calories, not dollars. The CEO of Crunch Fitness in the house. How would business of breaking a sweat is changing? We'll tell you about it.</p><p>Then, five straight, Golden State Warriors headed back to the finals. Those details right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Boston Globe reports: \"Why Wynn consider selling its Everett casino when it's so close to opening?\" The news sent shockwaves to political circles yesterday. Confused policymakers trying to understand Wynn's motivation and what the sale might mean.</p><p>The Denver Post writes this morning: \"Colorado weather: Denver under winter weather advisory as Front Range gets May blast of snow.\" We're less than a week away from Memorial Day, but it is still snowing hard in Colorado this morning. The National Weather Service reporting nine-inches of new snow in some areas, just before 9:00 p.m. last night. Parts of the state, under a winter storm warning.</p><p>And the San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports: \"Sweep complete: warriors ready for their date with history.\" The Warriors overcoming a big deficit to sweep the blazers and lose their fifth straight NBA final. We'll get more in sports coming up. But first, the big business in fitness. My next guest, weighing on the competitive gym industry as we kick off the summer this weekend. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have breaking news right now. Merck is going to acquire Peloton Therapeutics; Merck just announcing this now. The company is set to buy all outstanding shares for $1.05 billion. Now, Peloto Therapeutics was going to go public, but now Merck is acquiring that. We will look for more info on that and check out the reaction within health care, coming up. But first, survival of the fittest; Big Box Gyms is competing with boutique fitness classes and niche workouts. Joining us right now to talk about the business is the CEO of Crunch, Keith Worts. Keith it's great to have you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KEITH WORTS, CEO, CRUNCH: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is business going? I mean, I know Crunch has its own individual story, the company filed for bankruptcy protection back in 2009 and then came back and has been growing pretty strongly and consistently.</p><p>WORTS: We have. We have over 300 locations today. We started with -- in 2010 we had 20 locations. So, we've grown significantly over the last 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then, how is that growth happening?</p><p>WORTS: So, there's obviously significant tailwinds in the fitness business; there's a lot of new entrance into the market that's created a lot of folks that are interested in working out in gyms and we've been able to capture a lot of that market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is one of the biggest competitive threats, though, the Peloton user, the mirror user which is kind of more new-fangled way of interacting with -- in a class structure. Is that a competitive threat than other boutique gyms, whether it's a boxing gym or a cycling gym?</p><p>WORTS: It's not. The digital workout experience is more complementary than it is competitive for us. So, we have a product called Crunch Line, which is online digital workout platform. So, if you're a member of Crunch, you get to come in to our gyms and work out, you also have the ability to go home and take Crunch with you on the go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The mirror you can look at -- it's like you're in a class, right? You can do it in anything -- yoga, in aerobics, whatever it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, and it doesn't require giant piece of fitness equipment sitting in, you know, sitting in your office for you to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what are you doing in digital way? Do you need to get more involved in digital products like what Dagen is bringing up?</p><p>WORTS: Again, it's a piece of what we do. This product, Crunch Line, we have a 100 workout classes that are online and you can go and stream it at home, you can bring it with you to the gym. But Crunch is really about community of people that want to come together and fitness today is more social. People are spending their money, social currency, if you will, on workouts to meet people and have a good time and create community of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what's the strategy? How do you get growth accelerating from here?</p><p>WORTS: We expect to double in the next five years; we have got commitments from franchisees to grow by over 300 more locations in the next five years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>WORTS: That will be six-700 locations by 2022.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And are you investing in current locations? I know, I go to the one in Tribeka and you've done some new things there, with the equipment?</p><p>WORTS: We've been able to adapt our floor plans to reach that market segment that's out there, looking for more of a competitive workout or high-intensity workout. So, we put turf and functional zones in our gyms and we've been reinvesting back in our locations, again, to kind of modernize and adapt our floor plans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You got to have some turf. You have to have some turf in all gyms, because that was something that was kind of missing from traditional gym that's present in say, pro-athlete gyms. What's the hottest workout? Because again, with these gyms, it's all about innovating on classes, that's really, I know what drives traffic particularly in New York and Los Angeles. What's the hottest thing you've got going?</p><p>WORTS: So, I say HIIT workouts; things that really are high-intensity, interval training. HIIT, H-I-I-T, people really want to come in and have a tough workout, and get their heart rate up and have a really great experience and take away from -- create a diversion, if you will from everything --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But if you're not a little nauseated, you're not working hard enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How's pricing? Are you going to raise prices soon? What are you expecting?</p><p>WORTS: Well, we have two different business models. We have our signature locations that are here in New York and San Francisco that are priced in the premium end of the market. So, we're able to take pricing up $2.00, $3.00, $4.00 a month each year, and then our business model is in the lower price category of $10.00 to $20.00 a month and those pretty much stay static and really go after a different market share.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see business pick up during -- I mean, of the year, summer time, bikini season, things like that? Are these seasonal catalyst for you?</p><p>WORTS: Over the last 20 years. That's really kind of flattened a bit; it's a little bit even throughout the year. You still have peak in January, and then also pre-summer, for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Keith, great to have you. Thank you so much.</p><p>WORTS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Keith Worts from Crunch. Still ahead, hitting back, Huawei says it's being bullied by the United States, details next hour on the response from China on MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, May 21st. Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Retail earnings in high gear this morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019052101cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5F-RS51-DXH2-61SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7181\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 21, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00027TZ</classCode><className>HOME DEPOT INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS444120 PAINT &amp;

Good morning everybody, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Monday, it is Monday, August 20th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A fresh look at the Trump economy this morning, a new survey raising some questions about the administration's policies on tariffs and taxes. The president is doubling down on a strong economy, he did so Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to New Jersey for work, it's going to be all work and I think you see what's happened, the economy is maybe better than it's ever been, the numbers are coming out the best they've ever had. We just came out with new numbers, they've been just fantastic. Off the charts, so we're very happy about that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And markets this morning start the week stronger, Dow Industrials expected to be up about 70 points at the open, that's a third of a percent higher. S&amp;P500 this morning is up a quarter of a percent, six points higher. And the NASDAQ this morning set to open up about 27, that's one-third of one percent.</p><p>This after gains across the board on Friday, optimism over the trade talks with China lifts its stocks, Dow Industrials on Friday clocking in a gain of 110 points, almost one half of one percent. the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P also firmer.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are higher, similar situation here, money moving into equities, FT-100 up two-thirds of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up three quarters of a percent. and the DAX Index in Germany up better than one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets mostly higher at the close, best performer there was Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up one and a half percent. Japan was the outlier, down a third of a percent overnight.</p><p>Tensions with Turkey on the rise, the U.S. demanding the release of Pastor Brunson before considering any relief for Turkey.</p><p>Plus breaking overnight, a shooting at the U.S. Embassy in Turkish capital, we have all the developments coming up.</p><p>A little bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street this morning, PepsiCo acquiring SodaStream, that deal valued at $3.2 billion. Stock is up on SodaStream this morning, better than 10 percent.</p><p>A risk for children headed back to school, the Epipen shortage, what needs to be done to protect children from deadly allergies, we've got it this morning.</p><p>And recreating a classic, Aston Martin will remake the iconic DV5 from classic James Bond films and it is a lot more bells and whistles then you thought.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Today, the Executive Advisor and former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Toby Cosgrove is with us this morning. And FOX Business Network's Adam Shapiro. Good morning.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see everybody.</p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, EXECUTIVE ADVISOR AND FORMER CEO, THE CLEVELAND CLINIC: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for joining us Toby.</p><p>COSGROVE: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So we're happy you're here because there's a lot to talk about in the economy, in the hospital business.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cleveland Clinic has been, really, the leader in terms of quality. How would you characterize the market this morning in terms of healthcare and the hospital business.</p><p>COSGROVE: Well the hospital is under tremendous pressure financially. And as a result of that they're seeing a tremendous amount of consolidation going on, mergers and acquisitions are in all-time high and we expect that's going to continue.</p><p>The other thing that really brings an opportunity for healthcare to decrease the cost is the high-tech ability to use A.I. and machine learning and the cloud, it's pretty exciting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is. I feel like if you're not using A.I. Dagen in every industry you're going to get left behind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, absolutely. A huge area for growth. But in terms of the hospital consolidation, it becomes difficult as these hospitals merge or even these local practices to make sure that the communications is there where a hospital is communicating with the patient, communicating with its staff, communicating with the families. I experience that the last week, that's the only reason I bring that up.</p><p>COSGROVE: Well communication is always a problem across any large group and I think particularly so in the hospitals where there are so much emotion involved all the way around and so many people involved.</p><p>Just by the way, in a cardiac surgical operation, an individual is touched by 110 individuals. So enormous amount of number of people involved in the communication is a huge problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Huge problem and possibly huge opportunity. So we'll talk about that.</p><p>COSGROVE: Huge opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot on the table. Plus, big deal today, PepsiCo acquiring SodaStream.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes. And what a way to go out for the CEO of PepsiCo, $3.2 billion deal and this is really remarkable because SodaStream has managed to weather a lot of storms, keeps growing, people love to make the soda at home, you don't have to push. I know you'd be a big fan of not putting the sugar in it.</p><p>COSGROVE: Absolutely.</p><p>SHAPIRO: This could have McDonald's out of the Cleveland Clinic. But this is a $3.2 billion deal and what a great way to start Monday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to talk all about that. And I also want to take -- get your take on sugar because that's really important this morning in terms of diet and healthcare.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Tennessee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, along with Harvard Law Professor Emeritus and Author, Alan Dershowitz is joining us this morning. Allianz Chief Economic Advisor, Mohamed El-Erian is here, along with Hilton Management Chief Strategist Dick Bove looking at the financial services sector. Plus, former Small Business Administrator, Latino Coalition Chairman, Hector Barretto joins us this morning.</p><p>A lot coming up, don't miss a moment of it. And we kick it off right here with this top story and that is earnings in focus. Big retail names including Target, Kohl's, TJX, the Gap all set to report earnings this week on top of a big week last week as technology, big tech names traded a premium to the rest of the market.</p><p>Many investors believe the high prices are justified for tech, take a look at these valuations, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Accounting for nearly half of the S&amp;P500 rise this year alone. Not to mention that trillion dollar market value on Apple.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investors, Victoria Fernandez. Victoria, good to see you thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CHIEF MARKETING STRATEGIST, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTORS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you agree with that it's justified to see some of these valuations in tech accounting for so much of the S&amp;P's rise this year.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Yes. They've had a really good run. I mean, year-to-date technology and consumer discretionary, your top two sectors that have been performing they've come back a little bit over the last month but they still had a really good run.</p><p>We would actually take a little bit off the table right now from some of these names because of that strong that they've had. I think you can say perhaps its justified but I'm not sure it's going to continue with the same rate that we've seen in the past. I know we have some more companies coming out this week on earnings.</p><p>A lot of them tied with Amazon and since Amazon has done really well, perhaps we see continued strength there. But I think we're seeing a little bit of a turn in some of the technology names.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even Apple--it's Dagen McDowell, Apple being hitting an all-time high four straight record close on Friday. Best performer in the Dow so far this year, up nearly 29 percent. You would -- you would take some money off the table even with an Apple which, again, seems to surprise the naysayers at every turn.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: They do. They always seem to come out and surprised. Everyone wants to say that this is going to be the quarter that they don't do well but they seem to surprise every time.</p><p>If you look at the iPhone X sales, there was a huge surprise with the amount of sales that they had there in the margin that they have in those sales on their last earnings call. So I think there's always a surprise element for Apple. They're now more in that software kind of business in the services business than the hardware.</p><p>And now they're looking at doing their own content. So they're going to start competing more with maybe an Amazon and a Netflix than what we've seen in the past. So I think there's some different metrics, maybe we're going to have to start looking at Apple and see how they do, how that's going to affect their margins going forward. So I probably still would take a little bit off the table.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Victoria, when you say that -- well when you look at tech and you look at -- you say look at different metrics, a lot of their earnings when you talk about Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, a lot of that had to do with their cloud business.</p><p>And I was just curious because we saw in the last earnings reports how much of the revenue was contributed by growth in the cloud. How much more room is there for growth or is that coming to a peak?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Yes, I think there's still some room to grow. We saw it with Microsoft, that's where some of their largest growth was. There was actually an article in the Journal not tool long ago that said technology companies were going to increase their R&amp;D by about 24 percent over the coming quarters and their capex by almost 50 percent.</p><p>A lot of that is going into building out the cloud, we see it with some of the other names as well. So I think you still got some room to go there and obviously Amazon leading the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, we've been waiting for capital spending to really pick up. The Trump economic policy of lowering taxes as well as rolling back regulations seems to have un -- you know, sort of unleashed these animal spirits. Toby, what's your take on the broad economic backdrop right now?</p><p>COSGROVE: Well I think you're going to see a tremendous growth in the cloud. I expected to see it go up to 20 percent over by 2020. It's just - - just think about a huge amount of data there is in healthcare. The total amount of knowledge in data and healthcare is doubling every 73 days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>COSGROVE: And we can't manage any of that without the cloud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, with healthcare it becomes that much more sensitive to the privacy issues around technology, perfect (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>COSGROVE: One of the -- yes. But I think the privacy issues are really going to be handled pretty well by the cloud as it goes forward. So I -- you saw last week that IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, and Google all came together beginning to think that they can now have the interdisciplinary communication that's going to have their -- be able to use the data to come together much better than ever before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really incredible. I mean you said it was doubling every 73 days the amount of data and healthcare is doubling every 73 days. So that's one growth area in terms of -- in terms of the economy Victoria.</p><p>Is that where you see the growth? Are there areas within this economy that you see growing more so than others? I mean, look at the cloud business, what Toby is talking about.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: No, I think that's true. And to take us back Maria, what you were saying about capex, that's a key component for us on where we're looking to invest. Capex is growing, even the small survey that came out last week said the trend is higher in capex for small business.</p><p>We know that increases productivity and we saw the productivity numbers go higher last week and that's what potential GDP is, right? It's growth in your labor force that you're seeing and it's growth in productivity.</p><p>So I think if we have those numbers flow through then you've got to look at your industrial names as well, some of your manufacturing names. I think you're going to see some growth over the coming quarters there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then I attributed that to some of the economic policies. Let's take a look at the administration's economic impact because according to a new survey of economists, seven in ten say that the president's tax cuts are, \"Too stimulative\" because of the impact on the national debt.</p><p>More than 90 percent of the administration's tariff policies would actually hurt the economy. Your response to these numbers even in a strong backdrop you've got now worries about being too stimulative.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Yes, you do. And you've heard a lot of people worry about corporate debt as well that's coming out. It's along with the physical stimulus that we have and how that's going to affect us going forward.</p><p>I think a lot of the concern though is coming from tariff and the trade issue and how that's going to raise prices that's going to flow through to inflation. Again, we already have some positive news, perhaps China talks coming this week that that may pull back a little bit.</p><p>We do have to be concerned about our growing debt and obviously we have things like Social Security and Medicare that need to be addressed and that's always a very difficult issue. And so I'm not sure how far into that we will get. But we do need to be careful with stimulus packages going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Uncle Sam can still borrow at less than three percent, actually less than 2.9 percent a year over 10 years, number one. So no fear, no real fear showing up in the Treasury market.</p><p>And number two is worth pointing out, this is last week, the CBO came out with its projections, its GDP projections that our economy will be about $4 trillion larger than was projected in January of 2017 and that's in large part due to the president's policies of cutting taxes of really stimulating growth which many said was impossible so deep into this expansion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we've been waiting on wages. Another survey said that workers are about to take home their biggest paychecks in a decade. I know that sparks all other worries about inflation but --</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well you got to be careful with the -- the wage part of the equation is wasn't really grown. We've seen year-over-year wage growth of 2.7 percent but inflation now in July year-over-year is 2.9 percent.</p><p>So the people -- you know, the hourly workers really need to see their wages grow for all of this to get the big bang. The extra spending we're seeing on credit cards, you know, it's not keeping up with inflation, so some people read that as a good sign. But if people are buying things on debt and their wages aren't keeping up with inflation, we're setting up for a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With all due respect, this is a talking point that you're starting to hear from democrats, from people who are on the campaign trail that, \"Well, inflation is outpacing your wage growth.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's too stimulative.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By some other measures, wage growth is 2.8 percent year-over- year and your PCE which the Federal Reserve looks like is 2.2 percent. And, of course, energy prices would be elevated over the summer as they are every year.</p><p>So look at inflation in the fall and look at some other inflation indicators because that's not what people were talking about along the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's where the last three months of PPI and CPI, it's basically nothing.</p><p>SHAPIRO: At the -- at the end of the day it really is about what's in someone's pocket. And if people are spending more on credit, that means they don't have maybe quite as much in their pocket, that's what I'm saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Any thoughts on this Toby?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: And that service is still low as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. OK. All right.</p><p>COSGROVE: But I've also think you've seen a tremendous change in what the occupations are. I mean right now there's some -- the health education or health has grown up to 20 percent of the employment while manufacturing has gone way down --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COSGROVE: -- as a major change in with the economic pressures on healthcare these people aren't going to get paid as much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that requires a different skill set and training in healthcare. So the onus is on business as well as I guess the academia to make sure our people are, you know, armed with the right information to thrive in this economy.</p><p>COSGROVE: It's going to be a tremendous change in the workforce and what they're expected to be able to do overtime and this is going to require a lot of retraining.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Victoria, let me switch gears to international issues. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that the White House has rejected an offer by Turkey tying the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson to relief for a major Turkish back which, of course, is facing billions in fines overnight.</p><p>Then there's this, shots were fired at the U.S. embassy in the Turkish capital amid the deepening riff between the two countries. Do you see this getting resolved? How does this end?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Now, I would have thought it would have been resolved sooner. But I think its escalated a little bit. Erdogan I think really underestimated the fact that president has -- and his administration, they're willing to use the economic policy that we have to get the results that they want.</p><p>And we have the upper-hand on this right now. You know, Turkey has relied on foreign borrowing to such an extensive rate. They have surging inflation, capital account issues all over the place. So they really need foreign investment and they need that help. So I think the president is using it to his advantage to get what he wants.</p><p>I'm not sure that it will be resolved very quickly and we know Erdogan doesn't want to have any interest rate hikes which they probably need to help with their inflation. So they're sitting in a poor position right now to do negotiating.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well the Turkish leader was obviously the big story the last couple of weeks and there were worries that that would undermine the entire global financial markets, your thoughts on -- was that overdone Adam?</p><p>SHAPIRO: It might have been overdone. There was worries about contagion but the contagion it would appear is Spanish banks, Italian banks, French banks. The question is, do U.S. banks have exposure to those European banks but it doesn't seem that's going to spread yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll keep watching that. Victoria, good to see you this morning thanks so much.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Victoria Fernandez. Coming up, raising a glass to a new merger this morning, PepsiCo acquires SodaStream. The deal valued at $3.2 billion and stocks are on the move.</p><p>Social media versus conservative voices, the new outrage and now the president is weighing in. Back in a minute right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well an historic day at the DMZ. Cheryl Casone with the details, she's got headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Good morning Maria. Dozens of elderly South Koreans visiting North Korea for family reunions. They're meeting with relatives in the North that they've been separated from since the Korean War.</p><p>The emotional weeklong event comes as the two Koreas boost their reconciliation efforts. The temporary reunions are the first to occur since 2015.</p><p>Well you mentioned this top show Maria, PepsiCo expanding its range of healthier products. The soda sales continue to decline, the company is buying SodaStream for $3.2 billion, that's $144 per share in cash.</p><p>The deal expected to close by January 2019. Shares of SodaStream soaring as you can imagine on this announcement in the premarket, up more than 10 percent right now. Stock for sure to watch. Shares of PepsiCo down four percent this year, the buyer there.</p><p>Well, Waffle House is hitting the road, they're going to rent out food trucks for private events. Oh, yes. That means that you can serve up steak and egg, hash browns and, yes, waffles for your birthday, your wedding, your block party.</p><p>However, it's a little expensive. For starters, there's a $90.00 rental fee or the truck, then $50.00 per hour mileage fee to and from the event. Also events anywhere outside Georgia (INAUDIBLE) chronological fee for the cooks and for the driver but you get waffles Maria at your house.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's fun. I like that, I love food trucks.</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm. They're fun.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's -- and it's fun to think about them on -- at your party.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: PepsiCo SodaStream merger, you said earlier --</p><p>SHAPIRO: It's a great way for -- I always pronounce her name incorrectly, so I'll say the CEO of PepsiCo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Indra?</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes. Leaving -- you know, going out. But she goes out on a high note. I mean she's led this company for years and has done a really great job and this is kind of a captious successful career.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let me just add one thing, Waffle House is not about the waffles. It is about the -- no, it is about the hash browns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scattered, smothered, covered, chunk, diced, peppered, capped, topped, and country. I know that all -- that makes -- that gives you a logic to think about it. But that's what you eat at the Waffle House.</p><p>COSGROVE: But I think PepsiCo is obviously beginning to move away from the sugar drinks in a very big way and she's been leaving that for some time and my hats off to her, she's really doing a good job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do that in an environment where you got these huge buildup, you know, big gulp cups and just a society that's so knee deep in sugar, in everything?</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes. But I think you see this in all the cola companies, they're really moving to more and more products that have less and less sugar in them. And then I think that you've seen the decline in the consumption of cola across the country and across the world.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Is it the big growth area for Coca Cola the Dasani, the water business?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes.</p><p>SHAPIRO: I mean, they're just bottling tap water and selling it to us by bottle.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well -- and Pepsi finally got wise and is distributing seltzer it's -- they use their regular water and they inject carbonation to it, it's called Bubbly. It's great -- it's great branding certainly but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, you wonder if this is going to be like the tobacco company who once we figured out that smoking kills, everybody's behavior changed. Now we're learning more and we'll understand better that the evil situation that sugar represents.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes. With tremendous explosion in the obesity problem in the United States, now 40 percent of the people in United States is obese.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, the Trump economy and the Federal Reserve. New questions this morning about the Fed's current pace o rate hikes this year.</p><p>And then you could own James Bond's Aston Martin, you know. The company makes a limited number with Bond-like features, we've got the sky pry -- high price tag there as well, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Federal Reserve widely expected to approve another rate increase next month. My next guess is rising interest rates could put the stock market and the economy at risk.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Dick Bove, he is Hilton Capital Management Chief Strategist and Bank Analyst. Good to see you Dick. So we got a good backdrop, Federal Reserve's now on this rate rising move. You think they could go too far?</p><p>DICK BOVE, CHIEF STRATEGIST, HILTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, I think they are going too far. I think we have extraordinarily tight monetary policy at the present time.</p><p>For example, you know, rates have gone up seven times and they're supposedly projected to go up 12 times by the end of 2019. The Fed is dumping assets, I mean it's dropped $191 billion in terms of the size of its balance sheet and that's not even equal to the $260 billion that they're supposed to be down money supply and two, is only growing 3.7, 3.8 percent year-over-year.</p><p>And in the second quarter, money supply didn't grow at all, it grew zero percent. So we're creating a situation similar to what we saw when (INAUDIBLE) was coming in the early 1980s was basically extraordinarily tight.</p><p>And I don't think that can continue and I think that there's going to be a backlash not just from the United States government because we're going to see a $48 billion increase in the interest payment on the debt supposedly according to the Treasury this fiscal year.</p><p>But you've got cities around the country that are highly indebted require bigger payments. You've got, you know, countries outside the United States which are going to be affected very negatively if the dollar keeps rising and their dollar -- and their currency's keep dropping.</p><p>So I think there's going to be a significant political backlash and I think the president has the power to stop it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well don't you think though the Federal Reserve is aware of all this? I mean, after all we are looking at an unprecedented situation right now where they also have to unwind a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.</p><p>BOVE: Yes, no. They're very aware of it I'm sure. But they are thinking about inflation they're not thinking about the fact that the increase in interest cost is going to significant for all of the entities which, you know, borrow money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BOVE: And they're not thinking about the fact that if interest rates keep going up, it does, you know, just mathematically result in lower financial asset values. So I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what, Dick, you said the president -- the president could stop it moment ago, I don't know about that. I mean, you know, supposed to be independent of the administration, the Federal Reserve is and yet we did hear the president, Dagen, remember a couple of months ago the president said, \"Why are we raising interest rate so much? This is too much.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's a real estate guy, so higher interest rates even if they're awful rock bottom levels are never good, right? But to that point Dick, how could the president stop this other than cutting spending significantly?</p><p>BOVE: Oh, it can stop it politically. I think that the structure of the border governors of the Federal Reserve is extraordinarily unusual at the present time. You only have three of the seven people there.</p><p>Two of that three have their positions because they were nominated for either the chairmanship or the head of the regulatory area by the president. There are two more people being nominate -- that have been nominated. They're looking for Senate approval and the president will get to nominate two more even after that.</p><p>So it is possible that by the end of the year six of the seven board -- people on the board would have been nominated by the president. Are they going to turn their head and say, \"No, we're not going to listen to anything the president says.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>BOVE: And the president is clear, he doesn't want rates to go higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Right. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>COSGROVE: So when do you think we're going to get a rise in interest rates?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Next.</p><p>BOVE: Well, you know, obviously, you know, given what the president, the secretary of Treasury have said and what Larry Kudlow has said, you know, it's clear that they've got to do a little macho thing the next time around and increase rates.</p><p>It doesn't mean that December is necessarily going to be a hike and too soon that it's going to be three hikes in 2019 I think is a stretch. I just don't think that the United States political situation will accept it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So just to be clear you think another rate hike happens in September or December?</p><p>BOVE: In September.</p><p>BARTIROMO: September.</p><p>BOVE: December is a tossup and I don't think they'll go ahead with three in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Dick good to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>BOVE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dick Bove. Coming up, the Epipen shortage, the scary health concern for parents as the new school year begins. And then maybe the president's favorite way to communicate but he is slamming social media for allegedly silencing conservative voices. Plus, the surprising new admission by the CEO of Twitter, all that next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, August 20th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Twitter battle, President Trump taking to social media to blast social media companies for bias against Conservatives, some seeing it as latest attack in an online war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TPUSA: He won the social media war and that's what they see as a biggest threat for them going into midterms and heading into the re-elect in 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For the very latest in the fight for online freedom this morning, and then from armchair to armed, one furniture store owner turned the tables on an armed robbery, the details, coming up. Wait until you see this.</p><p>And then the Epipen shortage, parents with children with allergies are warning lives at risk, as they struggle to find device during back to school season.</p><p>License to thrill, Aston Martin, letting you get behind the wheel of one of the most famous spy cars ever, with the price tag and more, in just a bit.</p><p>Futures this morning, indicating a higher opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials off of the highs of the morning, but up 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent. NASDAQ up about a third of a percent, 21 points higher after upcoming trade talks with China led the market higher on Friday.</p><p>The Dow Industrials picking up 110 points on Friday at the close, one-half of one percent. The S&amp;P was up a third of a percent and the NASDAQ, picking nine points on Friday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, money is moving into equities once again, FT-100 up a half a percent, as is the CAC Quarante in Paris, the DAX Index in Germany up almost one percent.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, overnight. Best performer was -- in Asia, in Hong Kong, rather, Hang Seng up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first this, our top story this half an hour, Twitter under fire, President Trump blasting social media for censoring prominent Conservative voices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, admitting that his platform has a left-wing slant. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO OF TWITTER: Are we doing something according to political ideology or viewpoints, and we are not, period. We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology. We look at behavior.</p><p>We need to constantly show that we are not adding our own bias, which I fully admit is left -- is more left leaning, but we need to remove all bias from how we act and our policies and our enforcement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Conservative commentator Candace Owens joined me on Sunday, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" she has been censored. She's been thrown off Twitter and Facebook. She talked to me about the President's social media presence and the targeting of Conservative voices, Sunday. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OWENS: They are trying to assess how Trump won, and really, he ran an aggressive social media campaign and they see that people that were able to impact, they lost control because so many voices popped up and they no longer had to rely on just CNN, MSNBC or FOX.</p><p>They are all the social media stars that were coming out and speaking on behalf of him, that had a major impact and now, those voices are getting silenced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us now to discuss that is the Weekly Standard Deputy Editor, Kelly Jane Torrance. Good to see you, Kelly, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, EDPUY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How big of a problem is this?</p><p>TORRANCE: I mean, it's a problem, you know, that clip says it all, doesn't it? I mean, Jack Dorsey has his idea that we're going to have this, sort of, really nice get along Twitter big Kumbaya. But, actually, one of the funniest things I thought in the interview, at one point, he said that it's politics on Twitter, that's really uncivil.</p><p>But when people talk about sports or music, they're very civil. It's like, who is he even talking to on twitter, right? You know it's not just politics. People get worked up about everything.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Here is my question, in the 1970s, I can't think of her name but it was a Conservative book about the News-Benders, I think it was called, and it led to the creation of what we would call Conservative media.</p><p>These are private companies, Twitter and Facebook, and I think most of us, at this table, believe in a free speech free for all. So why not just open these venues up to total free speech. I realize there will be awful hateful things --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They are public companies.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Facebook. Public, but they are publicly traded.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SHAPIRO: But they are essentially -- they're not the public -- they're not the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're not run by the government, the government --</p><p>SHAPIRO: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They can censor the speech all they want because they are private entity.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Right. The Koch brothers or Mr. Ruddy over at Newsmax, launched a different kind of platform and let people say what they want to say. Why don't they do that?</p><p>TORRANCE: Well, exactly. You know, one of the problems is once you start censoring, where do you stop? And I think that's one of the problems Twitter faced with Alex Jones because they have been censoring some content, banning some accounts for, you know, being against their terms of service which, of course, are murky.</p><p>So then when people see Alex Jones, wait, why don't you -- why haven't you banned him? And so, the question is when you start, where do you stop, where do you draw the line and what's offensive and what's not. And I think, honestly, let's face it, we all at this table have opinions that Jack Dorsey probably finds very offensive. Millions of Americans have ideas of Jack Dorsey --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Congress is trying to get Jack Dorsey to testify and we may very well see that happen in the first week of September. I just want to throw that out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Jack all will come out of it, just as it was with Mark Zuckerberg, like nothing will happen other than Jack Dorsey, having a very well-prepared script by an army of lawyers. But it is very interesting with the Alex Jones situation that you had all of these social media companies and tech companies like Apple and Facebook, all take action against Alex Jones at the same time.</p><p>It does raise the issue that you have essentially an oligopoly of this -- a concentration of all the social media power and very few hands. Ultimately, that is the government's problem because they let these companies, particularly, Facebook, get as big as they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what they really want? They would like to see -- I think the Republicans would like to see some competition. Where can you get another social media platform that's actually not going to be, you know, suggestive that they are censoring Conservatives, they'd rather see that than actually quit legislation in place. I don't know if that happens.</p><p>TORRANCE: I worry about it backfiring. You got, you know, what I keep saying, we have all of these companies targeting --I find Alex Jones very hateful but I think he should have his voice and let us hear and then argue against him. I was worried it's going to backfire. You know, the media --</p><p>Americans don't really like the media, they don't trust it. When they see someone targeting someone, is it going to backfire? People are saying, hey, why are you trying to shut them down?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What you said was collusion. What you're talking about is all of these companies getting together and colluding to stop certain conversation. That's what you're talking about.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Privately-run companies, they're not the government. So let me be clear and get your Twitter ready, because you're going to hate what I'm going to say. So what if they censor? Let them. Start the other side, let there be competition. What I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's no competition.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: My issue is like --</p><p>SHAPIRO: because there's lots of money put there to start it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're like utilities now. They're like utilities and they're asking for greater regulation. It's in part the government's problem that they let them get so big.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, there's a clause in the law that doesn't let them sued. But personally, I'm all for free speech, even the hateful stuff, I'm Jewish, I don't like the Nazis, but hey, the Supreme Court said this about (INAUDIBLE) but if Twitter wants to censor people, if Facebook wants to censor people, let them. And if people are opposed to that, start a new company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You can't just let them because they have gotten too big at this point. Now --</p><p>SHAPIRO: You guys are sounding like people who want to regulate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: the conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Listen, my problem is, going back years, Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, they let the free flow of terrorist videos --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Murderers, live on YouTube.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People getting brutalized by the Islamic State. You could find it all over Twitter, all over YouTube, all over Facebook.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TORRANCE: If we -- law enforcement have actually seen some of those videos and figured out from them where people are aware it's happening and find them. See, I mean, it's terrible that that stuff is out there.</p><p>But at the same time, let it be out there rather than hidden because then you can find out who these people are, find if they are breaking the law, arrest them, and if not, let us argue against them, let's -- don't drive these ideas underground --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We don't want to see more government regulation but something has to give here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My issue is, the lack of government regulation in terms of how big these companies have gotten that have let them do this. And why are we at all surprised? This is what college campuses look like, what the social media companies are doing in terms of the social justice warriors and the identity politics.</p><p>And it's more important to teach a freshman rather than about math and science about which pronounce people should use so peoples' feelings don't get hurt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to say?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW: Well, I just want to say, two years ago, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. It's just the fact that they've grown so big and they now realized that they've got a social responsibility.</p><p>And two years ago, we weren't having the discussion. I don't think frankly, Zuckerberg and that group understood that their powered two years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: So we protect the fairness doctrine for cable television and for local T.V.?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's not my issue. My issue is, you know what's going to change their behavior? When people -- it is the bottom line. It's when their businesses get hurt by this, when people start turning their backs on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And again, Facebook in some ways, in terms, has been hurt in advertising or Google. Remember the ad placement on YouTube? That did hurt business, so people really -- again, it's up to the individual. We talk about freedoms in this country, if you don't like what they are doing, they don't use Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Speaking about violence, wow, what is going on in Chicago? Another violent weekend in Chicago nearly 50 people shot, 3 fatally, in Chicago, in a few days. The youngest victim was 19 years old. How do we call more attention to this problem?</p><p>TORRANCE: You know, I have to say, and I'm not -- I'm not being facetious, I'm being serious, I think we need to get Rudy Giuliani off Trump's legal team, get him off the Mueller thing and get him to Chicago, I mean, you guys know what he did to New York, he transformed New York.</p><p>It takes -- it's going to take a transformation, they can't just have business as usual. It's not (INAUDIBLE) there was a 3-year-old boy that didn't die but got shot in the leg. This weekend, you have people -- one person died, they were shot at 8:00 p.m. and yet another person shot at 8:00 a.m. I mean, this isn't just like a little bit crazy stuff going on. This is all day, all night in Chicago, and it's not safe.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But it's not just Chicago, it's cities all over the United States, and it's a tremendous proliferation of weapons and why does anybody need AK-47 or M16 to run around and buy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Chicago is particularly gruesome. I mean, there's something going on into the 50 shootings over the weekend.</p><p>TORRANCE: Well, you have to -- I mean, honestly -- I don't want to play identity politics, but you have to wonder would something -- would Rahm Emanuel would do more if it weren't basically black men that are being shot every day in Chicago?</p><p>I mean, you do have -- there was a woman shot. But I mean, this is a -- this is a real problem. It's like, what is it going to take for him to care enough to do something? I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We will keep watching. Kelly, good to see you, thanks so much, Kelly Jane Torrance, there. Coming up, turning the tables on a would-be robber, an armed Indiana store owner protects his own and it's all caught on tape. Wait until you see this.</p><p>Then, James Bond, yes, Bond, James Bond in your driveway, how you can get your hands on an Aston Martin like the one 007 drives, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, at least one bank weighing in on the future of Tesla, Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: This just crossing, Maria, JPMorgan is saying that Tesla does appear to be exploring ways to take itself private, but the bank also says the process is far less developed than originally believed. Remember two weeks ago, Musk caused a big stir when he said he wanted to take Tesla private in the tweet that happened during trading session, he said the funding was \"secured.\" Well, since then, it's became clear that claim really wasn't quite accurate. Taking a look at Tesla in the premarket down about two percent, so again some breaking news on Tesla to bring to you.</p><p>Also, this story this morning for you, furniture store owner turned in the tables on would-be robber, while being out a gunpoint. Police say, Doyle Stinson gave the suspect $10.00 but he demanded more and marched Stinson to the back of the store.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOYLE STINSON, FURNITURE STORE OWNER: Once he get me to the back room that was a mistake, if I come back here I hit my silent alarm emergency button, I have a 40 right here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Yes, the Indiana store owner grabbing his pistol sending the robber running scared as you can now see in the second part of the video. But Stinson said, he didn't pull the trigger because there were children in the area.</p><p>Well, you will soon be able to drive around like James Bond Aston Martin building and selling 25, 1964 Aston Martin DB5, the same car that Sean Connery first drove in \"Goldfinger.\" The cars are going to come with gadgets (INAUDIBLE) films a flipping license plate is one of those things. It's going to cost you a pretty penny, of course, they're going to sell for 3.5 million each car and they won't be street legal. So, OK, the first customers are going to get their DB5 in 2020. No word yet on if an injector seat could be included or lasers or other guns. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I guess you don't buy it for that. I mean, $3.5 million as soon as you drive it off the lot it's going down in value.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE: It's definitely -- and Adam Shapiro can answer this, a collector's car.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you can't drive it. That's street illegal. Where are you going to drive it? On a private run way? On your ranch?</p><p>SHAPIRO: You should get a street-legal version of this at the (INAUDIBLE) this weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, just to the dude on Twitter who saw me driving down I81 on the way to Virginia last Friday, it's creepy to tweet about it. I think I did saw you drive by in near I-8 that was weird.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is creepy. All right. Coming up, the EpiPen shortage is the major health concerns for parents as the new school year begins, back to school next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the shortage of the EpiPen is causing concern -- manufacturing disruptions and a spiking demand with schools opening up across the country, has affected the supply of the allergy drug. I recently spoke with Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar about this shortage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Drug shortages is a really important issue. It comes about the often from manufacturing issues as the manufacturers having trouble with just producing the product. I think it's very important first to remember that that is one product but it does not mean there's shortage of Epinephrine available for children. It's a particular delivery device. That's one of them and we're working to solve that drug shortage. But it doesn't mean that there is unavailable product for this very important type of medicine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we are with Dr. Toby Cosgrove from the Cleveland Clinic. And Toby, there's an article in the journal today, a shot of competition for EpiPen, do you like that, the Teva EpiPen, is this going to work?</p><p>COSGROVE: Absolutely. You got have competition, in fact, this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as drug charges is concerned. We recently had the shortage of (INAUDIBLE), which is necessary for doing cardiac surgery. We've recently had problem with all the -- with IV solutions which are all manufactured in Puerto Rico. And in fact, we had to go to glass bottles instead of plastic bags because the factory there was put out of business by the hurricane. And so we try to keep -- at the Cleveland Clinic, we try to keep multiple manufacturers so we're not depending on just one but we deal with and every hospital across the country is dealing with drug shortages all of the time just depends on what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the opioid crisis? Do you think that -- who bears responsibility for this opioid crisis?</p><p>COSGROVE: Well, first of all, last year recent all-time high of 72,000 deaths and really there's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: 72,000 deaths last year of opioid.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes. And that's up 10 percent, but, you know, we are seeing some -- a little bit of light in this very desperate situation. In New England states we're starting to see a decrease. We still see it going up in the Kentucky, West Virginia, the Ohio, those states particularly. And it's really related to Fentanyl being laced into the heroin. And Fentanyl and (INAUDIBLE) are the most very, very powerful. And really, addicts, don't realize what they're getting as a result, they're way overdosed. But I am -- I think that we -- I hope that we've seen the peak in this because people are now beginning to understand the magnitude of the problem. And all kinds of legislation coming to restrict the amount of opioids that are --</p><p>SHAPIRO: On bright note, congratulations, you know, Clevelander by choice, the two of us spent 10 years there. I remember the banners that always talked about the clinic being number one in U.S. world in news report, number in cardiology and heart surgery. If you need a heart, Cleveland supplies --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now currently number one in face transplants.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes, this is the fifth one that we've done this year. It's really a very exciting story and just amazing that you think about face transplants, you've got to connect arteries, veins, nerves and muscle, bone, and skin, and it's an enormous technical feat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The cover of story of National Geographic. Congratulations, Toby, we're going to talk more about that. Let's take a break. When we come back, ads could be coming to \"Stranger Things\" and your favorite Netflix shows. Details on that, next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thank so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, August 20th. Your top stories, right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Tesla under pressure, CEO Elon Musk taken on criticism over how much he sleeps.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018082001cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2X-J8K1-DXH2-6400-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 20, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most investors thought it was due to growing expectations that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>would be the next president after FBI Director <person><nameText>James Comey </nameText></person>cleared Clinton again after another probe of her emails. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big surge on November 7 snapped a nine-day losing streak for stocks that many attributed to <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>newfound momentum. Wall Street had decided Clinton was going to be the next president -- and they wholeheartedly approved.</p><p>So the fact that the market continued to rally last week after Trump won is, in some respects, even more surprising than the fact that he won in the first place.</p><p>The Dow jumped nearly 600 points -- a 3.2% gain -- in the three days after Trump's victory. It was up again Monday and hit a new all-time high in the process. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq also moved a bit higher after Trump's win.</p><p>Are investors now too complacent? </p><p>Sure, there are reasons for the market to cheer the Trump win. </p><p>A Republican in the White House and Republicans keeping control of Congress increases the chances of a bill being passed that would lead to more infrastructure spending. There may also be less regulations on health care stocks and financials.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, industrial stocks like Caterpillar, big pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Pfizer and giant banks JPMorgan Chaseand Goldman Sachsrallied sharply last week. They are all in the Dow too.</p><p>Expectations of higher spending by the federal government are one of the main reasons why bond investors have sold U.S. Treasuries to buy stocks. The selling pushed yields sharply higher since bond prices and rates move in opposite directions. </p><p>Still, several market strategists expressed concerns that the market is underestimating the possibility of Trump rattling the markets during his time in office. He remains highly unpredictable. </p><p>Just this past weekend, Trump vowed in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that he would not use Twitter as much as he did while campaigning -- but wound up launching a series of tweets attacking The New York Times for its coverage of him.</p><p>\"It is worth asking whether investors are, yet again, underestimating uncertainty,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorganFunds, in a report Monday. </p><p>\"While Mr. Trump's tone has been conciliatory since the election, his many changes of position during the election campaign beg the question of how aggressively he is going to pursue his stated agenda,\" Kelly added.</p><p>Trump's anti-immigration stance could also be a big problem for U.S. tech companies, which have attracted a lot of talented foreign workers due to the H1-B visa program. Will Trump seek to end that? </p><p>That may be one of the reasons why big tech giants Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet all fell last week. Silicon Valley is very wary of Trump -- and probably with good reason. </p><p>After all, Trump waged a Twitter war with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because he wasn't happy with the coverage he was getting from the Bezos-owned Washington Post.</p><p>A Trump war on tech could be bad news for the market and economy. The tech sector is now one of the most important industries in the United States. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are among the most valuable companies on the planet.</p><p>So even though tech stocks zigged while the rest of the market zagged last week, that probably can't go on indefinitely. Prolonged weakness for big tech companies would have a negative impact on the whole market over the long haul.</p><p>There's also the issue of how much Trump will actually be able to accomplish. </p><p>Yes, Republicans control Congress. But House Speaker Paul Ryan wasn't exactly the biggest Trump supporter during the campaign. There could be more roadblocks to Trump's plans than expected on Capitol Hill.</p><p>\"It is also hard to believe that Trump won't experience opposition in implementing policy. Trump and opposition are words that go hand in hand,\" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist of JonesTrading, in a report Monday.</p><p>The title of O'Rourke's report also summed up the rapid shift in sentiment. \"Trumpageddon to Trumptopia.\"</p><p>Now this isn't to say that the market definitely is due for a crash during the Trump administration. But experts think investors may now need to take a step back and remember that there still isn't a lot that the market knows about possible Trump policies.</p><p>\"There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what type of president Trump will actually be. In an election that was dominated by coverage of tweets, videos and emails, policy questions received surprisingly little airtime,\" said Andrew Sheets, a strategist with Morgan Stanley, in a report Sunday.</p><p>\"Those questions are now crucial for markets. To a remarkable extent, investors we've spoken to both before and after November 8 disagree on what President-elect Trump will actually do,\" Sheets added.</p><p>That is scary.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

La Monica</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Remember when the market rallied sharply last Monday? Most investors thought it was due to growing expectations that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>would be the next president after FBI Director <person><nameText>James Comey </nameText></person>cleared Clinton again after another probe of her emails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big surge on November 7 snapped a nine-day losing streak for stocks that many attributed to <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>newfound momentum. Wall Street had decided Clinton was going to be the next president -- and they wholeheartedly approved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So the fact that the market continued to rally last week after Trump won is, in some respects, even more surprising than the fact that he won in the first place.</p><p>The Dow jumped nearly 600 points -- a 3.2% gain -- in the three days after Trump's victory. It was up again Monday and hit a new all-time high in the process. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq also moved a bit higher after Trump's win.</p><p>Are investors now too complacent?</p><p>Sure, there are reasons for the market to cheer the Trump win.</p><p/><p>A Republican in the White House and Republicans keeping control of Congress increases the chances of a bill being passed that would lead to more infrastructure spending. There may also be less regulations on health care stocks and financials.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, industrial stocks like Caterpillar, big pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Pfizer and giant banks JPMorgan Chaseand Goldman Sachsrallied sharply last week. They are all in the Dow too.</p><p>Expectations of higher spending by the federal government are one of the main reasons why bond investors have sold U.S. Treasuries to buy stocks. The selling pushed yields sharply higher since bond prices and rates move in opposite directions.</p><p/><p>Still, several market strategists expressed concerns that the market is underestimating the possibility of Trump rattling the markets during his time in office. He remains highly unpredictable.</p><p>Just this past weekend, Trump vowed in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that he would not use Twitter as much as he did while campaigning -- but wound up launching a series of tweets attacking The New York Times for its coverage of him.</p><p>\"It is worth asking whether investors are, yet again, underestimating uncertainty,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorganFunds, in a report Monday.</p><p>\"While Mr. Trump's tone has been conciliatory since the election, his many changes of position during the election campaign beg the question of how aggressively he is going to pursue his stated agenda,\" Kelly added.</p><p/><p>Trump's anti-immigration stance could also be a big problem for U.S. tech companies, which have attracted a lot of talented foreign workers due to the H1-B visa program. Will Trump seek to end that?</p><p>That may be one of the reasons why big tech giants Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet all fell last week. Silicon Valley is very wary of Trump -- and probably with good reason.</p><p>After all, Trump waged a Twitter war with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because he wasn't happy with the coverage he was getting from the Bezos-owned Washington Post.</p><p>A Trump war on tech could be bad news for the market and economy. The tech sector is now one of the most important industries in the United States. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon are among the most valuable companies on the planet.</p><p>So even though tech stocks zigged while the rest of the market zagged last week, that probably can't go on indefinitely. Prolonged weakness for big tech companies would have a negative impact on the whole market over the long haul.</p><p>There's also the issue of how much Trump will actually be able to accomplish.</p><p/><p>Yes, Republicans control Congress. But House Speaker Paul Ryan wasn't exactly the biggest Trump supporter during the campaign. There could be more roadblocks to Trump's plans than expected on Capitol Hill.</p><p>\"It is also hard to believe that Trump won't experience opposition in implementing policy. Trump and opposition are words that go hand in hand,\" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist of JonesTrading, in a report Monday.</p><p>The title of O'Rourke's report also summed up the rapid shift in sentiment. \"Trumpageddon to Trumptopia.\"</p><p>Now this isn't to say that the market definitely is due for a crash during the Trump administration. But experts think investors may now need to take a step back and remember that there still isn't a lot that the market knows about possible Trump policies.</p><p>\"There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what type of president Trump will actually be. In an election that was dominated by coverage of tweets, videos and emails, policy questions received surprisingly little airtime,\" said Andrew Sheets, a strategist with Morgan Stanley, in a report Sunday.</p><p>\"Those questions are now crucial for markets. To a remarkable extent, investors we've spoken to both before and after November 8 disagree on what President-elect Trump will actually do,\" Sheets added.</p><p>That is scary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20161114stock-market-record-high-donald-trump1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M5R-5GW1-DY60-K13J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>12:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 14, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Bush's failed effort to partially privatize Social Security.\" Only 25% of Americans say they like the plan. About a quarter of Americans already know they'll pay more and just 14% believe they'll be less. </p><p>The plan was supposed to come out yesterday but was delayed until today because Ryan and his team don't know shit from Shinola. Katie Hunt reported that some issues were still unresolved hours before the bill had been slated for release[3]. The heart of the issue: whether the plan can meet the $1.5 trillion spending limit set by the budget and whether the cut will be distributed across the middle class. So-called distribution tables that outline the benefits for the wealth versus the middle class will be closely watched.Republicans are under political pressure to make sure it's viewed as a broad middle-class tax cut and not a package of tax breaks for wealthy Americans.<url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p-2D26zTCjc/WfoKpy3JaNI/AAAAAAABTC8/t6AheaN7aek59NJarF9KKufNmU2KkmIdACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-11-01%2Bat%2B10.54.30%2BAM.png\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p-2D26zTCjc/WfoKpy3JaNI/AAAAAAABTC8/t6AheaN7aek59NJarF9KKufNmU2KkmIdACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-11-01%2Bat%2B10.54.30%2BAM.png</url> So what does that mean? Trouble... big trouble[4]. Jonathan Karl reported yesterday that the closely held, half done plan lowers caps on 401 (k)s and cuts state and local tax deductions for middle class taxpayers. In other words, a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 2%. 401Ks - The White House, as the President tweeted, wanted to keep the current amount of annual of tax-free contributions ($18,000); House Republicans wanted to lower the limit to $2,400. The bill, as of this morning, does lower what individuals can contribute tax-free to their 401(k)s-- but it lowers it to a point about halfway between the current limit and what House Republicans had initially proposed.Deduction for State and Local Taxes - The latest draft eliminates the deduction for state and local income taxes. But it retains the deduction for local property taxes.Estate Taxes - The latest draft of the bill retains the elimination of the estate tax. Although there had been intense internal debate as recently as Tuesday night about phasing it in-- increasing the amount exempt from estate taxes (it's currently $10.9 million for married couples) for the first five years and then eliminating it altogether-- sources say the latest draft calls for the complete elimination of the estate tax.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X_ejwGM5KBw/WfoNXQ4A1hI/AAAAAAABTDM/CSz8x5AjxQQn2ncYnFdQS6ls1wLtUTYcQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-11-01%2Bat%2B11.06.00%2BAM.png\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X_ejwGM5KBw/WfoNXQ4A1hI/AAAAAAABTDM/CSz8x5AjxQQn2ncYnFdQS6ls1wLtUTYcQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-11-01%2Bat%2B11.06.00%2BAM.png</url> This is it[5]-- at least for now... their starting point as they debate each other and the lobbyists. It makes sweeping changes in corporate and individual taxes, including deep tax cuts, limits to the mortgage interest deduction and bigger family tax credits. It also includes provisions that are likely to stoke controversy and fierce lobbying, including limiting the deduction of mortgage interest for newly purchased homes up to $500,000. On two other flash points, the plan would \"retain\" 401(k) savings plans and allow people to write off the cost of state and local property taxes up to $10,000. The plan would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and create three new individual tax brackets of 12%, 25%, and 35%. It would maintain a 39.6 percent rate on top earners and boosts the child tax credit to $1,600. It would also double the exemption for the estate tax and repeal it after six years. Also gone: the medical expense deduction and the student loan interest deduction. The best headline I saw explaining the politics of the plan: \"President with 33% approval rating pushes tax plan with 25% approval rating.\" Although Frank Clemente, Executive Director of Americans for Tax Fairness had a way with words on this too: \"Apparently Donald Trump wants to call this tax plan 'The Cut Cut Cut Act.' That's appropriate because they're cutting taxes for billionaires, cutting taxes for corporations, and cutting funding for Medicaid and Medicare to pay for it all. In the meantime, some middle-class families will likely end up paying MORE in taxes because of the loss of popular deductions, while corporations will get a multi-trillion dollar windfall. It's outrageous and immoral, and voters will hold them accountable for it.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerI\">https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerI</url> spoke with some of the candidates Blue America has endorsed and some who we're still in the process of vetting. Sam Jammal is the non-multimillionaire running for the Orange County district as middle class as he is. The removal of the tax deduction for houses over $500,000 will cripple the home building industry-- and related endeavors-- in Orange County. The district, held by Trump rubber stamp Ed Royce, will go blue in 2018 unless the DCCC manages to insert someone no one in the district can relate to, a DCCC specialty. Sam told us that Royce's \"support of the Trump tax on our community shows he no longer represents us.\u00a0He only represents out of district millionaires and whatever Trump wants him to do.\u00a0This tax plan-- just on the elimination of the state and local tax deduction alone-- will raise taxes on 37% of families in the district.\u00a0That doesn't include the roughly 80% of families who own a home and likely benefit from the mortgage interest deduction or the thousands who save for retirement through 401(k)s.\u00a0A lot of us have known for a long time that Ed no longer fits our community, but it is shocking that he is helping push a tax plan that directly penalizes families in our community to benefit out of district millionaires.\"And all the California progressives are taking a similar approach. Katie Hill is running for a seat north of Sam's district (CA-25) that includes 3 valleys (Simi, Antelope and Santa Clarita) and is increasingly blue while still held by a Republican-- thanks again, DCCC-- Steve Knight. Like Sam, Katie is outraged that her congressman appears to think he represents Trump, Ryan and the GOP rather than the people who live in CA-25. \"Steve Knight and the House Republicans,\" she told us, \"are fighting for a policy that is so blatantly harmful that even the Trump administration is against it. I am running for Congress because I think my family, neighbors, friends, and community deserve a representative who will fight for them. Steve Knight's support of the Republican tax plan is proof that he has no intention of being that Representative. While I'm sure Steve's wealthy establishment donors are thrilled by his vote, the residents of the 25th district are outraged and will make their voices heard in November.\"Katie Porter is also working to represent an Orange County congressional district that Hillary won. \"Mimi Walters,\" she told us, referring to the rubber stamp Republican who holds the seat now, \"continues to do what she has done her whole career-- ignore the needs of middle class families here in Orange County to give handouts to corporations. Mimi Walters never fights for middle class families. She sided with Donald Trump over Californians 99% of the time. She sided with powerful drug and insurance companies over California families when she voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She sided with the NRA over the safety of our communities when she refused to regulate bump stocks or vote for simple background checks. And now she's siding with Paul Ryan's tax plan, which guts 1.8 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare, limits what people save from their own earnings in 401(k) plans, and eliminates state and local deductions for over 6 million California families.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_nYTvR6qN4E/Wfpm3zM0NfI/AAAAAAABTE8/P2aEFHEFOk4r-Cmvqce8YPO_z2bll4bDgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-10-17%2Bat%2B4.20.28%2BPM.pngThere\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_nYTvR6qN4E/Wfpm3zM0NfI/AAAAAAABTE8/P2aEFHEFOk4r-Cmvqce8YPO_z2bll4bDgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-10-17%2Bat%2B4.20.28%2BPM.pngThere</url> is no presidential election in 2018. Randy Bryce's campaign to repeal and replace Paul Ryan in Wisconsin is the substitute for that. Yesterday he reminded us that \"There used to be this thing called a 'pension.' It was something brought about thanks to unions where you could put money aside while you donated the best years of your life in order to enjoy a time to sit back and be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor.Thanks to this war on workers that has been brought upon us by the Banana Republicans, pensions are very rare these days. Instead, 401(k)s have been put in place.\u00a0Now even these are under attack. It is quite obvious that the GOP is determined to make all of us not within the top 1% need to work until we literally drop dead.\u00a0As Americans it is our duty to fight to make sure that democracy consist of one person equals one vote, not one dollar equals one vote.\u00a0We have some time, but not a lot.2018 is one year away. Our futures are worth fighting for.\"Three of the most likely Republican-held districts in Texas to flip next year are John Culberson's in Houston, Pete Sessions' in Dallas and the Austin-San Antonio corridor district held by Lamar Smith. All 3 have hotly-contested primaries. We spoke with the best candidates in each. Lillian Salerno, a former Obama Agriculture Department under secretary who made a name for herself as an anti-trust advocate, told us that \"This tax bill demonstrates the control corporate monopolies who boss around bagmen like Pete Sessions have over Congress. Just so they can have a tax cut, the monopolies want workers, small business owners, and independent family farmers to to pay more, work longer, and take more risk all for an ever-dwindling chance at retirement. Independent retailers and independent manufacturers are already feeling the squeeze from big tech controlling the marketplace. Small business owners and workers are wondering the same thing: how will they be able to retire when they don't even have a plan for mom and dad?\u00a0This tax hike on the middle class will end up with more corporate concentration, less competition, less innovation, and more profits in the hands of the monopolies. Every day we see what happens when folks with the power control elected\u00a0officials officials like Pete Sessions. Shameful behavior by those\u00a0unelected power brokers who navigate the\u00a0system\u00a0through t bagmen like Pete Sessions absent any regard for working families.\"Over in Houston, Jason Westin hasn't had any government experience. Instead he's been working as an award-winning cancer doctor and researcher. But healthcare isn't the only reason he's running. He told us that \" Culberson has been in office for nine terms, and it shows. The career politicians in Washington have become complacent to the concerns of their constituents, seen in the 'Cut Cut Cut' tax bill coming this week. This bill favors the wealthy donor class over the working family. Culberson has long sought to remove the estate tax, which only impacts the 0.02% wealthiest Americans with estates worth at least $5.6 Million and would increase the deficit by $270 Billion over a decade. The final details aren't clear, but it also appears the bill will dramatically shrink Americans' ability to save for their retirement with pre-tax dollars. How do these help moves help you? They don't. Culberson and his pals are passing a tax bill which will give huge breaks to the Billionaire-class Americans, and will leave the rest of us behind.\" We reached Derrick Crow in Austin. He started with a rhetorical question. \"Does anyone on the Republican side even pretend to care what happens to working families in this country? Lamar Smith and his allies want to give corporations tax cuts at a time when companies are hiding trillions of dollars in profits in offshore tax shelters. They want to repeal taxes on estates of more than $5.49 million or more. And they want to pay for all of this by taxing individual retirement accounts and slashing Social Security and Medicare. In other words, corporations and the one percent loot the treasury while the rest of us get the bill. How about this: how about Congress starts focusing on the real, central problem in this economy, which is that people who work the hardest for wages don't have enough money to get by. The bottom 50 percent in this country own 2 percent of the wealth, which is to say, they own nothing. We need to raise the minimum wage, provide health care and higher education as rights, and get government back on the side of the working class instead of the monopolists and the corporate bosses.\"This is what Paul Clements told me about the GOP tax plan-- and I sure hope he's getting the message out the same way to the voters in southwest Michigan (MI-06): The basics of the Republican tax plan are simple. Cut health care for the poor, the disabled, and seniors, and give the money to the richest Americans. Congressman Fred Upton, one of the richest men in the House of Representatives, heir to the Whirlpool fortune, is for it.This is so wrong. Wrong in so many ways.It's immoral, inefficient, and counter-productive. It will increase the chaos Republicans have already thrown our health care system into, it will lead to many tens of thousands of deaths-- or should we just say it will kill tens of thousands of low-income, disabled, and elderly Americans. And it is based on the lie that it will help the middle class.Eighty percent of the plan's tax cuts go to the Americans with incomes in the top 1%. We already have the worst economic inequality since the Great Depression-- this exacerbates it. No doubt may highly paid pundits will say it increases economic growth, and this is how it helps middle class Americans-- they will be lying. We've tried trickle-down economics. It doesn't work.Besides cutting health care, the plan cuts many other programs that support working Americans, and it puts government spending in a straitjacket. Besides transferring enormous wealth to people who are already enormously wealthy, it makes it that much harder to address the real challenges America faces in to build a strong and inclusive 21st century economy. With single payer health care Canada spends less than half what we spend per person on health care, everyone has access, and Canadians are healthier. Paying twice as much for worse health hurts our economy. It's time to bring American education into the 21st century-- our 20th century system fails our children and undermines our competitiveness. Oh, and a 21st century infrastructure would also help. Our criminal justice system holds too many people behind bars for too long, it breaks up families and communities, it raises our tax bills, and it doesn't keep us safer.Fred Upton and his Party have drunk the cool-aid, but it is the rest of the country that pays the price. Hopefully the tax bill won't pass. If it does, I for one will be speak loud and clear to voters in our district about what it means for us.Dan Canon, who's running for a seat in south central Indiana, made similar points more tersely: \"Many of our representatives, like the one currently occupying my district, bought their seats in Congress. They exist to serve the rich at the expense of the working class. Nowhere is this made more plain than in this GOP tax 'plan.' They're not even really trying to hide behind the great lie of 'trickle down' economics anymore. This scheme would pick clean the ever-shrinking carcass of the middle class, while ensuring that the top 1% stay infinitely wealthy for infinite generations. It isn't clear whether Trump's GOP merely wants a return to Dickensian England or something even worse, but it is quite clear that they are a party exclusively by and for the wealthy.\"Austin Frerick, comes from a similar anti-monopoly perspective that Salerno espouses. He's running in the southwest Iowa district that stretches from Des Moines to the Nebraska border. \"David Young,\" he told us, \"is trying to deliver what his donors bought with this 1% tax cut on the backs of hard working Americans. The repeal of the estate tax especially irks me. Young says he wants to repeal it to help farmers. That's just a lie. He's doing it to save the Koch Brothers billions. Only 44 Iowans even paid the tax in 2016. This is just another example of David Young twisting reality for the 1%.\"Jenny Marshall, a North Carolina public school teacher is taking on multimillionaire Republican, Virginia Foxx in a central Piedmont district (NC-05). \"For far too long, Republicans like Rep. Virginia Foxx have been pushing trickle-down economics as a solution for working Americans,\" she said.\u00a0\"Donald Trump's plans for a stripped-down budget are a result of these faulty economics and Foxx has been a giddy cheerleader for its passing.\u00a0In her speech from the House floor, she claims that this tax plan will 'level the playing field,' but what she does not mention is the harm that will come from those who rely on 401(k) plans and itemized deductions of state and local income taxes.\u00a0In addition, they will strip families of the personal exemption deduction in favor of tax cuts for large corporations.\u00a0Under the leadership of Donald Trump and Virginia Foxx, working families will keep waiting for a 'level playing field' that will never come. I am demanding a fair economic system for the people, not for the wealthy elite.\"Up in central Illinois, emergency room doctor, David Gill, comes from a similar place. \"My Republican opponent, Rodney Davis,\" he said, \"has repeatedly demonstrated his lack of concern for the ordinary citizens that live here in IL-13-- maybe he's forgotten that he became an 'accidental Congressman' back in 2012 through sheer luck, when a liberal independent split the progressive vote just enough to keep me out of Washington by a slim 0.3%. His votes in Congress have been a slap in the face to the hard-working individuals who live here. This tax reform bill that he supports will reward the ultra-wealthy and the corporations that fund his campaign, and it will bring true hardship to the vast majority of IL-13 citizens. Supporting the elimination of the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes for individuals shows, once again, that Davis is completely out of touch with the residents of his district. He was able to get away with such heartless votes the past few years, when he faced only token and conservative Democratic opposition. But after spending the past couple cycles on the sidelines, working in the Emergency Room and serving as the Assistant Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, I'm now running in IL-13 once more, and my boldly progressive campaign is shining an very bright light on Davis' performance. Voters from across the political spectrum are completely disgusted with 'swamp critters' like Mr. Davis; as I travel around the district, they are chomping at the bit, eager for the opportunity to end his political career in November 2018.\" Michael Kotick is one of half a dozen serious Orange County candidates competing for the Democratic nomination to run against Putin's favorite congressman, Dana Rohrabacher. Michael, at 34, is also the youngest-- and a can-do, out-of-the-box problem solver from a business background. \"If Rohrabacher votes for this bill, as proposed,\" he told us, \"he will effectively be voting against Orange County residents keeping their hard-earned money (SALT), blocking the retirement savings pathway for millions (401k) and potentially kicking-off a snowball effect that will impact the property values of those in California, long-term. All of which goes almost perfectly against every anticipated benefit of a 'tax cut initiative,' except if you are in the top 0.2%. Let's just say that this tax plan is going to impact a lot of people, dramatically. If passed as proposed, it may be the single greatest action (besides #45) to help flip House seats in California from red to blue. If the tax cut is paid for as proposed by the 2018 House budget-- with more than a trillion dollars in cuts from healthcare, education and affordable housing- that just rubs salt in the wound. By\u00a0voting 'yes' on this budget with the hope of a tax plan that looks lopsided and shaky at best, Dana is directly voting against all of us in Orange County. Time's up, Dana.\"Kara Eastman is the most recent candidate Blue America has in our vetting process. She's running for the Nebraska Democratic nomination to take on Republican freshman Don Bacon who beat serial party-switcher and anti-choice far right Blue Dog Brad Ashford. Before Kara gets too run, she has to take on.. yep, Ashford again. (He lost his job in Omaha and figured he might as well run again. Needless to say the Blue Dogs and DCCC are encouraging him.) Kara told us that \"While the GOP debates whether or not to lower the tax rate for the top 1% of earners in the United States and whether or not to limit the ability of the middle class to save for retirement in our 401(k) plans, they also are crafting legislation that will see more people lose their health insurance.This kind of sabotage doesn't help Americans who have the right to quality and affordable health care. It's also unacceptable that this Congress let the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expire a month ago. So it's time for our leaders to prioritize our nation's children and reform our health care system for the better. Instead, too many of them stand ready to subtly sabotage it and focus legislative efforts on benefiting the wealthiest people in our country who can afford to weather this storm.\"This meme has been floating around the Internet for the last week or so.

I ignored her, of course. It was just something parents said. Fast-forward a few decades and now I'm the parent. My 5-year-old lives in a world where screens aren't fixed pieces of furniture, but lie around on the kitchen table, on the sofa, by the bed, constantly accessible. You can't even avoid them by going outside. \"Screens are not only in our pockets, they're on billboards, buses and bins,\" says Tim Smith, a psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The concerns have multiplied with the screens. In the past decade, we have heard that they will rewire our brains, strip us of cognitive abilities and damage our mental health. Many of us feel more distracted by them, feeling grumpier, guiltier and more tired as a result. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630233-300-guilty-pleasures-when-is-it-wise-to-switch-off-your-screen/\">list of ills makes square eyes sound benign</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So should we take these concerns more seriously? Given the amount of time so many of us spend with our lit-up devices, it is an important question.</p><p>The trouble is, many of the most emphatic answers are the least reliable. Smartphones and tablets are not only TVs, they are chat rooms, shopfronts, banks and photo albums. We use them to work and play, to record physical activity and monitor sleep. We can look up peer-reviewed papers or scroll through anti-vaxxing forums, crucial distinctions that disappear when we use the umbrella term \"screen time\". As the fears grow and the debate becomes ever more heated, it's time to separate the proven health advice from the hyperbole.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are screens bad for our bodies?</emphasis></p><p>Smartphone pinky, tech neck, bone spurs at the back of our skulls: the ailments we are meant to have inflicted on ourselves through excessive phone use all sound terrifying. Hence the headlines. In truth, there is no good evidence that such alarming conditions are caused by our tech habit.</p><p>Any harm is likely to be far less spectacular. The World Health Organization, for example, recommends limiting screen time as a way of tackling <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/obesity/\">obesity</url>, voicing no health concerns related to screens in particular.</p><p>What about the effect of staring at small, bright screens on our eyesight? In the past few years, more children in the UK have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630221-200-good-looking-how-time-outdoors-could-protect-kids-eyesight/\">prescribed glasses</url>, says Max Davie at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in London. This has led some to claim that phones and tablets are to blame. But Davie thinks the increase in prescriptions has more to do with aggressive management of existing conditions. \"At the moment, we don't have sufficient evidence for a causal link,\" he says.</p><p>One thing that does appear to be taking a hit is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030750-600-whats-the-best-way-to-get-to-sleep/\">sleep</url>. Studies have shown that people who are given a book to read in bed find it harder to go to sleep if they read it on a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630233-300-guilty-pleasures-when-is-it-wise-to-switch-off-your-screen/\">screen rather than on paper</url>. This is probably because of the blue light that most screens emit, which throws off our       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24232320-100-how-getting-more-daylight-can-improve-your-mental-and-physical-health/\">circadian rhythm and tricks us into thinking it is daytime</url>.</p><p>Of course, most of us who look at our phones last thing at night aren't reading a book. Much sleep disruption is related to mental stimulation: waiting for the next notification, say, or scrolling through endless news feeds. Insufficient or disrupted sleep has been linked to increased risk for all manner of health problems, including depression and other mental health concerns (see \"Are screens messing with my head?\").</p><p>\"If there are any recommendations to be adopted, not using screens in the hour before bed seems to be the one with the greatest support,\" says Smith.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are screens messing with my head?</emphasis></p><p>From video games to gambling, the apps and websites we can access on our phones have sparked widespread concern. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731640-500-how-google-and-facebook-hooked-us-and-how-to-break-the-habit/\">Big tech companies are also adept at tapping into our need for social validation</url>, hooking us on likes, retweets and follower counts. In testimony to a US Senate hearing in June, Tristan Harris, a former Google designer and co-founder of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://humanetech.com/\">Center for Humane Technology</url>, argued that the internet has created a culture of mass narcissism.</p><p>This has led many to worry about the emotional stresses of a hypersocial world on adolescents. A quick online search brings up dozens of papers linking screen use or social media with detrimental effects on mental health, including depression, anorexia and suicide. Some figures suggest girls are more affected. \"After two decades in decline, the mental health [problems] of 10 to 14-year-old girls have shot up 170 per cent in the last eight years,\" Harris said in his testimony.</p><p>Such sound bites are alarming. They are also widely believed, thanks to popular books like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">iGen</emphasis> by <url normalizedValue=\"https://psychology.sdsu.edu/people/jean-twenge/\">Jean Twenge</url>, a psychologist at San Diego State University, which claims that digital technology has wrecked a generation. The trouble is that the underlying data can be used to tell different stories, says Amy Orben at the University of Oxford, who studies the impact of digital technology \u2013 and social media in particular \u2013 on mental health.</p><p>Ultimately, social media is just one of many different things that might affect someone's well-being. Without controlled studies, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.</p><p>When Orben started looking into screen use a few years ago, she wanted to explore some of the more extreme claims researchers were making. For example, Twenge has linked social media use with teenage depression and suicide. Orben was curious to look at the evidence herself.</p><p>She found it didn't stack up. First, she spotted shortcomings in several large studies from 2017 that claimed to reveal correlations between the use of devices with screens and depressive symptoms in users. \"I found that changing how the data was analysed would give me very different results,\" says Orben.</p><p>To put her and her colleagues' results in perspective, they compared the effect of device use to other things in an adolescent's life. For instance, they looked at the effect of wearing glasses and found that this was correlated more negatively with well-being than screen use. They also looked at how often adolescents ate potatoes. \"Potatoes are in a similar ballpark to screens,\" says Orben. That doesn't mean they should be banned from schools.</p><p>Twenge stands by her findings, pointing in turn to what she considers flaws in Orben's statistical methods. For Davie and others, however, the effect of screen time and social media use on mental health remains speculative. \"We cannot regard social media overall as good or bad,\" says Davie. He believes Orben has done fantastic work in myth-busting, but warns against making blanket statements about individuals. He says he would never tell bereaved parents that an Instagram post about self-harm played no part in the death of their child, for example. \"We don't know that in individual cases social media is not responsible,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Am I addicted to my phone?</emphasis></p><p>Unless you are using it for purposes we already know are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/addiction/\">addictive</url>, such as accessing gambling websites, the answer is probably not. Yet reaching for my phone has become an annoying tic and a phantom buzz in my pocket can make me pull out my phone and check for messages that aren't there. Whenever there is a lull in my concentration \u2013 in the middle of writing this sentence, for example \u2013 my thoughts return to my phone. What's going on?</p><p>In front of the US Senate, Harris painted a damning picture of the methods that tech companies like Facebook and Twitter use to command our attention in what he described as a \"race to the bottom of your brainstem\". He called out design tricks like pulling down on the screen to refresh it, which shares characteristics with the mechanism of slot machines. \"It has the same kind of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229710-600-obsession-engineers-mind-control-the-candy-crush-way/\">addictive qualities that keep people in Las Vegas hooked</url>,\" he said.</p><p>We are also in thrall to the recommendation algorithms that know what we want better than we do. More than 70 per cent of viewing time on YouTube consists of people watching videos suggested by the platform rather than sought out deliberately. \"You sit down to watch one video and wake up 2 hours later and say 'Oh my god, what just happened?'\" said Harris. \"The answer is that you had a supercomputer pointed at your brain.\"</p><p>All this means we are often sucked into our phones, thoughts elsewhere, even when we have more immediate things to focus on \u2013 such as crossing a road. The risks have led authorities in a handful of towns, including Augsburg in Germany, to install traffic lights on the ground in the hope that distracted pedestrians won't step in front of a bus.</p><p>Although the increased risk of distraction is very real, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24332470-700-am-i-addicted-the-truth-behind-being-hooked-on-gaming-sex-or-porn/\">talk of addiction may be too simplistic</url>. \"I think we need to be very careful about the use of the word 'addiction',\" says Davie. \"Addiction has a specific meaning of compulsive use, requiring increasing doses and a damaging effect on your life. But there are a lot of people who spend 8 hours a day playing games and that's just how they like to spend their time. It's OK as long as it's not interfering with the rest of your life.\" You aren't addicted, but you may have a terrible habit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How much screen time should kids have?</emphasis></p><p>This is where I struggle most. Not only do I get distracted by my phone when I should be paying attention to my daughter \u2013 \"Dad. Dad. Dad!\" \u2013 but I use screens to distract her all the time. When I need to cook, when I need to make a work call, when I'm feeling tired, I just stick her in front of a screen. Is this a problem? It all depends who you ask and how old your child is. There are no guidelines for teenagers, for example, and even the advice for younger children is far from clear.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) discourages parents from allowing children under 2 to have any interaction with screens and recommends no more than an hour a day for 2 to 5-year-olds. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/digital_media_symposium_proceedings.pdf\">The World Health Organization says that children</url> under 3 should have no screen time and those aged 3 to 4 should be limited to an hour a day, but its focus once more is on curbing childhood obesity.</p><p>The UK government largely follows the AAP's guidelines. But the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has opted not to recommend time limits at all. \"There's general confusion,\" says Smith.</p><p>He thinks the college's approach is the most logical. It bases its position on a regular review of research and has concluded that there isn't enough evidence of positive or negative effects for any guidelines to be issued. \"That's a very honest way of creating evidence-based policy,\" says Smith.</p><p>The college's view is that advice is only as good as it is effective. \"People's support for an outright ban on screen time for children under 2 lasts until they spend a day where there are children of different ages in the same room,\" says Davie. \"Then they quickly realise it's unworkable.\" He thinks guidelines that are hard to comply with fail to help families establish good habits and are ignored.</p><p>When it comes to negative impact, potatoes are in a similar ballpark to screens</p><p>It isn't all negative. In 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/15896/\">Smith and his colleagues found</url> no evidence that spending time interacting with a screen \u2013 rather than moving around or interacting with other humans \u2013 delayed certain developmental milestones, such as learning to walk and talk. On the contrary, they found a correlation between screen use and earlier development of fine motor skills, such as the ability to pick up blocks and stack them in a tower.</p><p>Once again, there is no causal link. It could be that those infants who happen to develop fine motor skills early are simply more likely to pick up and play with a screen. It is possible, though, that the prodding and swiping needed to work a screen trains these skills.</p><p>We shouldn't underestimate the value of screen use for older children too. Not only do they provide unprecedented access to many forms of valuable information and entertainment, but educating children about the dangers they will find online requires them to have some familiarity with it. \"In order to think critically, kids need to engage,\" says Smith.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How can I learn to stop worrying and love my screens?</emphasis></p><p>The explosion of mobile phone use has revolutionised our lives. I can download movies and podcasts, write articles, communicate with my family and broadcast to the world all at the push of a button. This is unprecedented power, but there are still many important questions about these maddening, valuable devices that we have been unable to answer. What is clear, however, is that many initial reactions have been more knee-jerk than evidence-based.</p><p>Rather than impose arbitrary constraints, we should take a look at our use of screens and ask how they fit with the activities and lifestyles we want as individuals and families. Orben, who is 24, has grown up with social media. For her and her peers, managing how they spend time with their screens was part of growing up. \"Like any social media user, there are times when I feel I should use it less, that I need to feel in control,\" she says. \"We all have ways in which we try to self-regulate.\"</p><p>Maybe you tweak your phone's settings to reduce the number of alerts you get, or uninstall certain apps so they aren't readily available. Some have suggested introducing \"mental speed bumps\" that interrupt the habit of checking a phone too often, such as writing a note to yourself on your lock screen or simply wrapping a rubber band around the device as a reminder.</p><p>Apple and Android phones and tablets now come with widgets that let you monitor and manage screen use. You can set time limits, turn off notifications and track what you have been doing on the device. There are also \"night-time\" settings that cut the blue light emitted by the screen and a \"wind-down\" mode designed to make the screen less enticing by turning it black and white.</p><p>These all help us become more conscious of our usage. But Apple and Google could do more, says Smith. \"It's a little bit of a misdirection,\" he says. For one thing, these widgets don't allow you to explore your screen use for periods of more than a week, which you might want to do to see if any lifestyle changes are making a difference.</p><p>Every new technology with widespread impact has given rise to new fears. Orben recalls an article from 1941 that lamented how adolescents in the US were addicted to radio programmes. \"In a lot of parenting magazines from that time, you could just replace the word 'radio' with 'social media' and you could probably publish that today,\" she says.</p><p>So the best bet may simply be to ask yourself what level of screen use makes you and those around you happy and try to stick to it. If you find yourself overindulging, don't panic \u2013 and certainly don't feel guilty. Nobody knows anything worth getting scared about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The truth about video games</emphasis>Hear Pete Etchells discuss the impact of video games at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Scientist</emphasis> Live on 12 October <url normalizedValue=\"http://newscientistlive.com\">newscientistlive.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg24332490600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4K-CHW1-JBPJ-70M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2464\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 243</volume><issueNumber>No. 3249</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It's happening on the eve of this year's G8 meeting of the world's richest 8 countries, which is being chaired by France this year.</p><p><br/><br/>French President Nicolas Sarkozy is convening the Forum as a place for decisionmakers in the internet and tech industry to interact with world leaders. It's the first time something like this is done ahead of such a huge international summit.<br/><br/>The eG8 is a great idea: there's often a huge gap of incomprehension between people in the technology industry and policymakers. These are two very different worlds that often have a very hard time understanding each other. So convening such a high level summit sounds like a great way to build some bridges and get some conversations started on important issues in tech.<br/><br/>Info about the eG8 has started to slowly leak out, and here's what we've found out following conversations with insiders:<br/>  The event is organized by Publicis Groupe via its events subsidiary Publicis Live, which is also selling sponsorships to other attending companies to pay for the whole thing. It's going to take place in swanky, custom-built tents on the Jardin des Tuileries, right in the most scenic center of Paris.<br/><br/> The event's announced overarching theme is \"Accelerating Growth\" but we know there are going to be three big themes for the sessions and workshops: the internet business in general and disruptive technologies in particular, the internet and human rights (topical given what's going on in the Middle East), and the internet and privacy.<br/><br/> The attendee list is yet to be nailed down, but confirmed attendees include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  chairman <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, </nameText></person>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, as well as all the big tech CEOs in France like Vente Priv\u00e9e's Jacques-Antoine Granjon and Iliad's Xavier Niel. Many startups will also be invited.  <br/>Overall it sounds like it's going to be a fascinating event, and we'll keep covering it.<br/><br/>Don't Miss: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-davos-2011-1\">THE TRUTH ABOUT DAVOS ?'</url><br/><br/>For the latest tech news, visit       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\">SAI: Silicon Alley Insider</url>.

The role of this body is to address the societal impact of technological progress. As a direct result of its existence, the country introduced its first bioethics laws in 1994. Current French bioethics laws were adopted on July 7, 2011. Back then, I was leading the neuroscience and public policy programme at the prime minister's Centre for Strategic Analysis. </p><p>During this time, I took an active role in the research and preparation of areas of law related to neuroscience data. Despite three years of work and contributions from dozens of experts, the French parliament adopted legislative recommendations that went against our findings. It was tough to learn that in matters of science and technology, regulators and policy-makers often lack state-of-the-art knowledge and have interests that are not aligned with the industry. As the latest revision process comes to an end, with new bioethics laws expected to be voted in next year, several public consultations have been conducted throughout 2018. Given recent news, it is to be expected that issues related to privacy and the use of personal data figured prominently in these conversations. A few days ago, at Gitex Technology Week in Dubai, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, advocated for a radical restructuring of the online world, arguing that global companies have become far too powerful and that several high-profile data-sharing scandals have highlighted the need for change. Tech companies and individual employees are taking their responsibilities to the public seriously. A document published by Microsoft earlier this year discusses the possibility of a coders' Hippocratic oath, similar to that taken by medical professionals, reinforcing the fact that that their mission is also to \"first do no harm\". However, relying on the industry to regulate itself is clearly not enough. According to the Pew Research Center, 51% of people in the United States believe that big tech companies should be more heavily regulated than they are. The US Honest Ads Act aims to bring regulation of digital political advertisements in line with those on TV and radio, where disclosure of funding is compulsory. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforced in the European Union addresses issues of privacy and the selling of personal data. Both are steps in the right direction. Yet, according to a recent analysis, five months after it was introduced, it appears that the GDPR has negatively impacted ad trackers used on websites, but increased Google Ads' market shares in Europe. In October, three major scandals involving big tech have broken: Facebook providing a forum for hate speech against the Rohingya; WhatsApp being used to influence the Brazilian elections; and Google being forced to shut down Google+ after failing to disclose user data leaks. In spite of all this, Pew's research shows that 74% of Americans believe that the services provided by big technology companies have done them more good than harm, while 63% believe \"they have had a net positive impact on society as a whole\". Speaking purely theoretically, it is easy to say that tech companies need to self-regulate, otherwise consumers will simply stop using their services. This could happen, but it is not necessarily the way that humans behave. People should, of course, be concerned about their online privacy, but many apps and websites save us time and make our lives easier. It is likely that a significant number of people will want that convenience and be willing to accept that their data being used for commercial purposes is the price that needs to be paid for it. There is one thing that scares me more than algorithms that can accurately predict my behavior being used to inform policy and marketing strategies. That is flawed methodologies and inaccurate data analysis being used for the same purposes. This has been happening for decades, with governments relying almost exclusively on faulty, self-reported data gleaned from surveys, questionnaires and focus groups. Unlike the recent concerns about big data, people have been largely silent about this. Consumer awareness relating to the commercial use of personal data is extremely positive. So are the steps towards regulation being made by the industry and policy-makers - as long as the latter are working from an informed perspective and willing to listen to expert advice. However, we should not forget that the sharing of data is not just of commercial benefit. It has allowed great strides to be made in medical and life sciences. If my data can be used to provide better healthcare to people, I'm all in. The process simply needs to be transparent, legal and ethical.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Not a few people's Twitter accounts, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-accounts-of-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-elon-musk-appear-to-have-been-hacked-11594849077\">all of Twitter</url>. Someone compromised the entire Twitter network, probably by stealing the log-in credentials of one of Twitter's system administrators. Those are the people trusted to ensure that Twitter functions smoothly.<br/>The hacker used that access to send tweets from a variety of popular and trusted accounts, including those of Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, as part of a mundane scam-stealing bitcoin-but it's easy to envision more nefarious scenarios. Imagine a government using this sort of attack against another government, coordinating a series of fake tweets from hundreds of politicians and other public figures the day before a major election, to affect the outcome. Or to escalate an <url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/twitter-security-flaws-pose-a-unique-threat-to-nuclear-diplomacy-experts-say-b509e0eb2aad\">international dispute</url>. Done well, it would be devastating.</p><p><br/>Whether the hackers had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxdwy/twitter-encrypted-direct-messages-dms-ron-wyden\">access to Twitter direct messages</url> is not known. These DMs are not end-to-end encrypted, meaning that they are unencrypted inside Twitter's network and could have been available to the hackers. Those messages-between world leaders, industry CEOs, reporters and their sources, heath organizations-are much more valuable than bitcoin. (If I were a national-intelligence agency, I might even use a bitcoin scam to mask my real intelligence-gathering purpose.) Back in 2018, Twitter said it was exploring encrypting those messages, but it hasn't yet.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/bezos-hack-amazon-saudi-mbs-whatsapp/605755/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The staggering vulnerability of global elites</url>]<br/>Internet communications platforms-such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube-are crucial in today's society. They're how we communicate with one another. They're how our elected leaders communicate with us. They are essential infrastructure. Yet they are run by for-profit companies with little government oversight. This is simply no longer sustainable. Twitter and companies like it are essential to our national dialogue, to our economy, and to our democracy. We need to start treating them that way, and that means both requiring them to do a better job on security and breaking them up.<br/>In the Twitter case this week, the hacker's tactics weren't <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591846464233474\">particularly sophisticated</url>. We will almost certainly learn about security lapses at Twitter that enabled the hack, possibly including a <url normalizedValue=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/\">SIM-swapping attack</url> that targeted an employee's cellular service provider, or maybe even a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos\">bribed insider</url>. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/16/twitter-security-breach-response/\">FBI is investigating</url>.<br/>This kind of attack is known as a \"class break.\" Class breaks are endemic to computerized systems, and they're not something that we as users can defend against with better personal security. It didn't matter whether individual accounts had a complicated and hard-to-remember password, or two-factor authentication. It didn't matter whether the accounts were normally accessed via a Mac or a PC. There was literally nothing any user could do to protect against it.<br/>Class breaks are security vulnerabilities that break not just one system, but an entire class of systems. They might exploit a vulnerability in a particular operating system that allows an attacker to take remote control of every computer that runs on that system's software. Or a vulnerability in internet-enabled digital video recorders and webcams that allows an attacker to recruit those devices into a massive botnet. Or a single vulnerability in the Twitter network that allows an attacker to take over every account.<br/>For Twitter users, this attack was a double whammy. Many people rely on Twitter's authentication systems to know that someone who purports to be a certain celebrity, politician, or journalist is really that person. When those accounts were hijacked, trust in that system took a beating. And then, after the attack was discovered and Twitter temporarily shut down all verified accounts, the public lost a vital source of information.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/how-twitter-harms-left/605098/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why Twitter may be ruinous for the left</url>]<br/>There are many security technologies companies like Twitter can implement to better protect themselves and their users; that's not the issue. The problem is economic, and fixing it requires doing two things. One is regulating these companies, and requiring them to spend more money on security. The second is reducing their monopoly power.<br/>The security regulations for banks are complex and detailed. If a low-level banking employee were caught messing around with people's accounts, or if she mistakenly gave her log-in credentials to someone else, the bank would be severely fined. Depending on the details of the incident, senior banking executives could be held personally liable. The threat of these actions helps keep our money safe. Yes, it costs banks money; sometimes it severely cuts into their profits. But the banks have no choice.<br/>The opposite is true for these tech giants. They get to decide what level of security you have on your accounts, and you have no say in the matter. If you are offered security and privacy options, it's because they decided you can have them. There is no regulation. There is no accountability. There isn't even any transparency. Do you know how secure your data is on Facebook, or in Apple's iCloud, or anywhere? You don't. No one except those companies do. Yet they're crucial to the country's national security. And they're the rare consumer product or service allowed to operate without significant government oversight.<br/>For example, President Donald Trump's Twitter account wasn't hacked as Joe Biden's was, because that account has \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam\">special protections</url>,\" the details of which we don't know. We also don't know what other world leaders have those protections, or the decision process surrounding who gets them. Are they manual? Can they scale? Can all verified accounts have them? Your guess is as good as mine.<br/>In addition to security measures, the other solution is to break up the tech monopolies. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have so much power because they are so large, and they face no real competition. This is a national-security risk as well as a personal-security risk. Were there 100 different Twitter-like companies, and enough compatibility so that all their feeds could merge into one interface, this attack wouldn't have been such a big deal. More important, the risk of a similar but more politically targeted attack wouldn't be so great. If there were competition, different platforms would offer different security options, as well as different posting rules, different authentication guidelines-different everything. Competition is how our economy works; it's how we spur innovation. Monopolies have more power to do what they want in the quest for profits, even if it harms people along the way.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/big-tech-pandemic-power-grab/612238/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What Big Tech wants out of the pandemic</url>]<br/>This wasn't Twitter's first security problem involving trusted insiders. In 2017, on his last day of work, an employee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/02/trumps-twitter-account-was-temporarily-deactivated-due-to-human-error/\">shut down President Donald Trump's account</url>. In 2019, two people were charged with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-saudi-arabia-by-digging-into-the-accounts-of-kingdom-critics/2019/11/06/2e9593da-00a0-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html\">spying for the Saudi government</url> while they were Twitter employees.<br/>Maybe this hack will serve as a wake-up call. But if past incidents involving Twitter and other companies are any indication, it won't. Underspending on security, and letting society pay the eventual price, is far more profitable. I don't blame the tech companies. Their corporate mandate is to make as much money as is legally possible. Fixing this requires changes in the law, not changes in the hearts of the company's leaders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-twitterhackshavestop614359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DS-6WV1-JCG7-V00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Clearview AI, the facial recognition company that boasted of scraping billions of photos from the internet[2], is being investigated by data privacy watchdogs in the UK and Australia.The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) announced a joint investigation[3] into Clearview AI on Thursday.The two regulatory bodies said the investigation will focus on Clearview AI's \"use of 'scraped' data and biometrics of individuals.\"Clearview AI describes itself[4] as a \"search engine for faces.\"It claims its software scrapes images of people's faces from popular sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Google.Users are then able to upload a photo of someone's face to Clearview AI's app, and it will show them where else that person's face has appeared on the internet.The company was relatively unknown until January when The New York Times[5] published an expos, claiming the company's technology was being used by police forces.This prompted outrage at the way the company collected people's images and biometric data without their consent, and the company was hit with a series cease-and-desist letters from big tech companies like Facebook[6], Twitter, and YouTube[7].In February the company said it had suffered a major data breach exposing its client list[8], which revealed it was used by many clients who were not law enforcement.The ICO and OAIC said in their statement they would collaborate with other data privacy bodies where appropriate. </p><p>Canada announced in February[9] it was launching a similar probe into Clearview AI's data practices, and on Monday the company announced[10] it was shutting down its business in Canada due to the investigation.The ethics of facial recognition are under particular scrutiny at the moment, and last month IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft announced they would suspend the sale of their facial recognition software to law enforcement[11].This came about after the George Floyd protests threw the spotlight back onto the ethical problems surrounding selling facial recognition to police, as the technology has frequently been shown to exhibit racial bias.

The UK's ICO and Australia's OAIC are looking into Clearview AI's \"use of 'scraped' data and biometrics of individuals.\" ...</p><p>Facial recognition company Clearview AI is now the subject of a joint investigation from privacy regulators from the UK and Australia.  The UK's ICO and Australia's OAIC are looking into Clearview AI's \"use of 'scraped' data and biometrics of individuals.\"  Clearview AI was brought into the public eye by a New York Times investigation in January, which revealed the firm scraped billions of images from the internet without consent to build its facial recognition app.   Clearview AI, the facial recognition company that boasted of scraping billions of photos from the internet , is being investigated by data privacy watchdogs in the UK and Australia.    The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) announced a joint investigation into Clearview AI on Thursday.  The two regulatory bodies said the investigation will focus on Clearview AI's \"use of 'scraped' data and biometrics of individuals.\"Clearview AI describes itself as a \"search engine for faces.\"  It claims its software scrapes images of people's faces from popular sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Google.  Users are then able to upload a photo of someone's face to Clearview AI's app, and it will show them where else that person's face has appeared on the internet.    The company was relatively unknown until January when The New York Times published an expos\u00e9, claiming the company's technology was being used by police forces.  This prompted outrage at the way the company collected people's images and biometric data without their consent, and the company was hit with a series cease-and-desist letters from big tech companies like Facebook , Twitter, and YouTube . In February the company said it had suffered a major data breach exposing its client list , which revealed it was used by many clients who were not law enforcement.  The ICO and OAIC said in their statement they would collaborate with other data privacy bodies where appropriate. Canada announced in February it was launching a similar probe into Clearview AI's data practices, and on Monday the company announced it was shutting down its business in Canada due to the investigation.    The ethics of facial recognition are under particular scrutiny at the moment, and last month IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft announced they would suspend the sale of their facial recognition software to law enforcement .  This came about after the George Floyd protests threw the spotlight back onto the ethical problems surrounding selling facial recognition to police, as the technology has frequently been shown to exhibit racial bias.

And now, in a hotel thronging with tech executives, she was recounting her plan to overhaul how their companies treat children. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The problem, as Baroness Kidron sees it, is that apps like YouTube and Instagram use data-fueled enticements -- such as tallying ''likes'' and automatically personalizing videos that play one after another -- to get youngsters hooked on their services. Children, she says, are no match for the turbocharged influence tactics, and often stay glued to the services even if doing so makes them unhappy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''The idea that it's O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons -- it's not a fair fight,'' Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. ''It's little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.''</p><p>  Her goal is to counter that power dynamic, so that children's rights and protections in the digital world more closely resemble those in real life. And she's not just talking about it -- she is changing the law.</p><p>  Lady Kidron, who was born a commoner, helped lead a campaign to remake how Facebook, Google and other tech companies treat children online in Britain. Two years ago, she persuaded her peers in Parliament to push through sweeping new rules meant to stop online services from exploiting children's personal data to manipulate their behavior. The changes are meeting fierce resistance, with tech companies and trade groups lobbying to weaken the new rules before they are codified this year.</p><p>  Lady Kidron's efforts are part of a drive by lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to rein in the immense power, and data abuses, of Big Tech. Amid that intensifying scrutiny, some officials have zeroed in on the companies' treatment of children.</p><p>  In March, Senators Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, introduced a bill to strengthen children's online privacy. In July, the Federal Trade Commission said it was considering updating a children's privacy rule to keep pace with advances in technology. Also last month, Senator Hawley introduced a ''social media addiction bill'' that would require online services to turn off ''nudging'' techniques like autoplaying videos -- an effort that seems inspired by the new British rules.</p><p>  ''Parents are concerned. Parliamentarians are concerned,'' said Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, an independent government regulator who wrote the new children's rules after Lady Kidron persuaded Parliament to support the protections. ''The kids aren't all right.''</p><p>  It took a long time for Silicon Valley to see Lady Kidron coming. That may be because she does not fit the mold -- privacy advocate, remorseful former tech executive -- of a typical industry challenger.</p><p>  Lady Kidron, 58, says she developed her antennae for power, and how people wield it, as a child in London. While healing from surgery to repair a cleft palate when she was 10 years old, she was not allowed to run or speak. To communicate, she carried around a pencil, a notebook and a horn -- ''like Harpo Marx,'' she said.</p><p>  ''One thing about being silent for a period of a year is that you very much notice who is included, who is excluded, who is dominant, who is excluded and where the power lies,'' Lady Kidron recounted.</p><p>  She channeled that interest in power dynamics into a career as a filmmaker. She alternated directing popular feature films -- ''Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'' -- with making documentaries on social justice issues like child prostitution in India.</p><p>  In 2012, she was one of two commoners nominated  to serve in the House of Lords, an appointment that came with the lifetime aristocratic title of baroness. That year, Lady Kidron decided to make a documentary about children and the internet, ''InRealLife.''</p><p>  She spent months embedded with tweens and teenagers, sitting next to them as they lived their digital lives. They exchanged messages with friends, fell in love with strangers, were bullied, watched pornography and played video games. The documentary features the children describing how they felt simultaneously interested, hooked, influenced and repulsed by online services.</p><p>  ''I was worried about some of the feelings they were having,'' Lady Kidron said.</p><p>  By 2014, Lady Kidron had started a foundation, 5Rights, to promote children's digital rights. But she felt frustrated with major tech companies. They scrambled to handle one problem after another for children on their sites, she said, but appeared unwilling to make major changes to try to avert such problems in the first place. She concluded that the only way to give children more privacy, more freedom and more control over their online experiences was through regulation.</p><p>  In 2017, she proposed the idea of children's online protections in Parliament as an amendment to a national data protection bill. The bill generally called for protections for children's data, but Lady Kidron pushed to detail those protections.</p><p>  In real life, ''we've already decided that children have rights,'' Lady Kidron said. ''For me, it's all a part of just making tech normal.''</p><p>  The proposed rules are called the Age Appropriate Design Code. Among other things, they would require that online services turn on by default the highest privacy settings for all minors, preventing things like automated location tracking. They would also require the services to automatically turn off techniques that could push children to stay online longer or provide the companies with more personal data than necessary.</p><p>  The changes present a challenge to platforms like YouTube and Instagram, which have said their services are not intended for people under 13 -- even though tens of millions of children use them. The British code would apply to all online services, including social networks and messaging apps, that are likely to have users who are under 18.</p><p>  ''It is provocative to technology companies,'' Ms. Denham, the information commissioner, acknowledged. ''It is going to change systematically, and on a systems level, how services are delivered for kids.''</p><p>  The tech industry is pushing back, saying the code is too broad and so vague that it will be difficult to comply with.</p><p>  In particular, companies have objected to the code's definition of a child as a person under 18 -- instead of, say, 13 or 16. They have also objected to applying the protections not just to children's sites but to all sites in Britain that are likely to have minors as users. A children's online privacy law in the United States, by contrast, applies only to nursery rhyme apps and other services directed at children under 13.</p><p>  Industry and civil liberties experts also warn that the code could reduce user privacy, the opposite of its intended outcome. To comply with the code, these critics say, apps might need to collect more information about users to determine their age.</p><p>Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had held discussions with the Information Commissioner's Office about the children's code. Last month, the company hosted a design challenge to create ways to show teens online how their data is being collected and used.</p><p>  ''Facebook works with parents, experts, and policymakers to ensure that privacy and safety measures are in place to protect teens and limit the ways young people can be targeted by advertisers,'' said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman. ''We are committed to continuing this work.''</p><p>Google, which owns YouTube and offers an app to help parents control their children's internet use, declined to comment.</p><p>  In public comments filed with Ms. Denham's office last year, the companies said parents should be the ultimate arbiters of their children's internet use. Facebook also warned that strict new standards might inadvertently push young people to use untrustworthy services that ignored the rules.</p><p>  ''The code is trying to break new ground and being very ambitious,'' said Vinous Ali, the head of policy for TechUK, a trade organization in London whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. ''Yet it is not taking a very targeted, narrow approach to where the harms are.''</p><p>  Lady Kidron and Ms. Denham said some companies seemed not to have processed the idea that under the new rules, their businesses would need to put the best interests of children above their corporate bottom lines.</p><p>  ''What I haven't heard from the companies is acknowledgment about the kind of practices that are in place right now to keep kids' eyes online,'' Ms. Denham said, practices ''that push for a quantification of friends, that enable more data-mining, that treat our kids like commodities.''</p><p>  Back at the boutique hotel, it was time for Lady Kidron to head to her room. She was meeting the next day with Nick Clegg, Facebook's global policy head and a former deputy prime minister of Britain, to discuss the company's objections to the children's code. And she wanted to prepare.</p><p>  ''The main thing they are asking me is: 'Are you really expecting companies to give up profits by restricting the data they collect on children?''' she said, referring to various online services she had met with this year. ''Of course I am! Of course, everyone should.''</p><p>  As she arose from a rattan couch and crossed the largely empty hotel patio, a Facebook policy lawyer spied her and came over to welcome her to Silicon Valley.</p><p>  ''Am I really welcome?'' Lady Kidron asked pointedly in a comment that was half charm, half stiletto.</p><p>  ''You are always welcome,'' the lawyer said.</p><p>  The conversation quickly finished, and Lady Kidron, still mulling the comment, moved off toward the lobby.</p><p>  ''The more trouble you are,'' she concluded, ''the more they say that to you.''</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

And the CMA's chairman, ex-MP Andrew Tyrie, was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">ousted last month</url> in a coup by board members unhappy with Tyrie's political, attention-seeking style.</p><p>This week it released <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">the final report in its study of the digital advertising market</url>. In it, the CMA concluded that the digital advertising market was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">uncompetitively dominated by Google and Facebook</url> - Facebook via its social media apps, and Google via the popularity of Youtube, Google Search, and the company's network of advertising on third party websites.</p><p>The report is underwhelming. After a year of work, the CMA has failed to identify any real-world consumer harms arising in the market, and instead spends 12 pages out of 440 speculating about how consumers \"might\" be worse off, without providing any evidence that this is the case. </p><p>Instead of economic analysis, the report largely relies on the gut feel of its authors. It asserts that prices in certain segments are too high without any suggestion of what prices \"should\" be. Google and Facebook's advertising businesses are assumed to be in separate markets, which, perversely, would imply that the two companies could merge without harming competition.</p><p>The report dismisses the vast reductions in the prices that digital advertising companies like Google and Facebook have charged over the past decade, nor does it mention the benefits that targeted ads have given to small and medium businesses who can now compete with larger corporate advertisers.</p><p>When the report does try some economic analysis, it is crude. Comparing the 'cost of capital' - what companies must pay to raise funds for investment - with profitability may be appropriate for things like the electricity or water networks, where returns are predictable in advance.</p><p>But to do so in digital markets completely misunderstands the economics of these markets, where businesses spend tens of billions a year on research and development (which itself may be a sign that these companies face strong competition) and where the launch of any new product is a gamble. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">Flops like Facebook's digital currency Libra,</url> or Google's stream of failed social networks, and the difficulty all the big tech companies have had with competing with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">Zoom</url> show how unpredictable digital markets can be, even for tech giants.</p><p>Video sharing app TikTok's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">rapid growth</url> is dismissed by the CMA, even though TikTok - which young people now watch more of than YouTube - has come from virtually nothing in the space of a few years to become one of the key players in social media. If this market was dominated by incumbents, as the CMA assumes, this would not be possible.</p><p>Worst of all, the analysis never gets to grips with the incentives that tech companies have to invest in products that don't make them much money directly. Google invests in Android precisely because it can make money from it by being the default search engine. That may be bad for other search engines, but without it Google would have much less reason to invest in Android, and competition in the smartphone market between iPhones and Android devices would dry up. </p><p>Facebook's targeted advertising may seem intrusive, but it also helps them to avoid showing users irrelevant adverts. If it was forced to stop targeting ads, as the CMA has suggested, Facebook would have much less incentive to invest in the things about its products that users want in the first place.</p><p>The CMA constantly focuses on individual trees, and misses the forest. All this adds up to a report that, at over 1,500 pages long, is as broad as an ocean but as shallow as a puddle.</p><p>This does not stop the CMA from proposing a new system of regulation for big tech companies, and a new regulator, sitting within the CMA, to enforce it. This regulation would subject the likes of Google and Facebook to the sort of regulation that is usually imposed on energy companies and supermarkets, and would inevitably slow down innovation and dampen investment in digital markets.</p><p>Worse, the CMA is proposing to give itself essentially dictatorial powers to break up digital businesses whenever it likes. In extreme circumstances, the agency can already break up companies in markets it deems to be uncompetitive. It did this in 2009, forcing the owners of Heathrow to sell off Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh Airports, and the result has been increased competition and lower airfares. </p><p>But to do this the CMA must go through a long, careful process that protects businesses from arbitrary breakups. The CMA is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/14/alok-sharma-told-push-new-audit-watchdog/\">now proposing to throw out these protections.</url> This is not compatible with the principles of private property or the rule of law, and would cut against Britain's post-Brexit ambitions to be a haven for international investment. </p><p>The report feels like it has been written to justify a predetermined set of recommendations that are themselves likely to do harm. Far from the evidence-based policymaking that the CMA should be working towards, this looks like an exercise in policy-based evidence-making.</p><p>                     Sam Bowman is the director of competition policy at the International Center for Law and Economics and a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64132616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608G-NYB1-F021-6323-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Despite this, it doesn't seem the EU Commission seems will take any action, which \u2014 to concerned members of European Parliament \u2014 highlights its and EU member states' hypocritical and dangerous approach to people's privacy. When Julian King, the European commissioner for security, acknowledged the existence of the secret report[1] detailing the UK's illegal and sloppy data practices \u2014 which the EU Observer revealed in 2018[2] \u2014 he added that 'there are a number of member states that have challenges in this area.' While the remark might have been made to decrease the severity of the UK's infraction, for MEP Sophie in 't Veld[3] it only hints at a bigger systemic problem. </p><p>'We never hear about these types of cases until it appears in the media or somebody leaks documents. This isn't how a democracy works, there's supposed to be accountability and transparency,' in 't Veld told TNW. 'The European Commission doesn't seem to understand that, and nor do the member states' governments. This is ridiculous.'The UK authorities made illegal copies of the #Schengen[4] Information System, incl photos ...ngerprints of EU citizens and gave access to US companies  Will the @EU_Commission[5] present findings of a detailed ...ift inquiry to @Europarl_EN[6]? Questions from @RenewEurope[7] LIBE\u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HDtZkq8Z4o[8]; \u2014 Sophie in 't Veld (@SophieintVeld) July 26, 2019[9] This is why in 't Veld and her fellow Renew Europe[10] MEPs are asking the Commission to make a full inquiry into possible illegal data breaches by member states and share them with the European Parliament, so MEPs can fulfill their power-checking role. Secrecy doesn't serve the peopleThe secret report, which MEPs didn't have access to before EU Observer's reveal, outlined years worth of violations by British authorities after they received restricted access to the Schengen Information System (SIS[11]) back in 2015. The SIS is an EU-run database which contains names, biographic information, photographs, fingerprints, and arrest warrants for almost half a million non-EU citizens denied entry into the Schengen zone. In addition to that, it has personal information, such as biometric data, of more than 100,000 missing people and 36,000 suspected criminals. The UK sloppily made full and partial copies of the database, and stored it on laptops at airports and government offices, making it vulnerable to further breaches. British authorities also gave private US contractors, such as IBM, access to the data, which means the information could be requested by US authorities under the Patriot Act. Now if this information is mostly shared to stop crime, what's the big deal about spreading it? Well, because the UK used static versions of the database (i.e. the illegal copies), it means authorities often worked with outdated information \u2014 possibly letting criminals pass through or unnecessarily stopping people already cleared from SIS. In 't Veld acknowledges the use of limited personal information and modern technology is needed to catch the 'bad guys' \u2014 but we live in a democracy where there are limits to government powers.Credit: Glyn Lowe PhotoWorks[12]<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/08/06/the-uk-illegally-copied-sensitive-eu-data-but-the-eu-doesnt-seem-to-care/#The\">https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/08/06/the-uk-illegally-copied-sensitive-eu-data-but-the-eu-doesnt-seem-to-care/#The</url> European Commission is the EU's executive branch. It's responsible the day-to-day business of the EU as well as proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and upholding the EU treaties.;Citizens trust governments to handle their information according to the law, so in case of a breach they must be held accountable. In 't Veld and her colleagues believe these types of data breaches shouldn't be kept from the public or from Parliament. If there are indeed more data breaches like Commissioner King hints at, they need to be thoroughly investigated and made public to make sure there are checks and balances to government powers. Most people have come around to the importance of privacy after revelations of malpractices of big tech companies such as Facebook[13], but people remain unaware that our governments are also guilty of mishandling data. 'There should be indignation, but instead there's complete silence \u2014 and probably also ignorance \u2014 about how public authorities are handling our data, and our civil rights,' in 't Veld explains. 'And there's ignorance, because authorities don't talk about it, they keep it a secret. So how are they any better than Mark Zuckerberg?'Governments should be held to the same standards as ZuckerbergEurope is definitely at the forefront of privacy and GDPR is a true feat of regulation[14] \u2014 but it doesn't completely apply to government operations as they were moved to a separate directive. For in 't Veld, this was a fundamental mistake which also shows how hypocritical the EU's lax stance on governments' illegal handling of personal data is. The UK and the EU summoned Zuckerberg to answer for the Cambridge Analytica debacle and criminal investigations were launched. But these same authorities are mum on their own abuse of data, such as the commercialization air passengers' personal information, about which in 't Veld and her colleagues have sent questions to the Commission[15]. In 't Veld believes it's about time the Commission holds member states and government agencies to the same standards as others. 'It's not even a matter of 'practice what you preach.' It's respect the law and be punished if you don't \u2014 because that's what happens to normal citizens and companies.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/08/06/the-uk-illegally-copied-sensitive-eu-data-but-the-eu-doesnt-seem-to-care/#Mark\">https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/08/06/the-uk-illegally-copied-sensitive-eu-data-but-the-eu-doesnt-seem-to-care/#Mark</url> Zuckerberg being grilled by EU representatives. Hopefully the EU itself and its member states will be held to the same standards. Brexit pressureThe UK's imminent departure from the European Union is bringing to a raft of issues, as standard procedures have been upended by the chaos. As with other privileges and accesses it was awarded due to its EU membership, the UK has made overtures to stay in various information sharing agreements in regards to security after Brexit. In 't Veld thinks this will likely happen, but not due to a grand deal or political breakthrough \u2014 it will simply be established with on-going negligence. 'I think the European Commission and other member states will simply turn a blind eye and continue to give UK access, while not being bound in any way to EU standards. I think that's what they'll do because that's what they're already doing with the United States.' MEPs like in 't Veld are deeply disappointed by the Commission's sweeping of the UK's illegal data handling under the rug. It's a huge concern and other non-governmental entities wouldn't receive as much slack. This is why in 't Veld believes the UK \u2014 and any other country that's been found guilty of illegal behavior (if the Commission will ever reveal them) \u2014 should be taken to court. 'If you cross the line by one millimeter, you should be charged,' in 't Veld stated. Brexit is set to happen on October 31 (and Boris Johnson swears this will happen), so in 't Veld and her colleagues are expecting a swift response from the Commission \u2014 hoping it will hold governments to the same privacy standards as anyone else.

The party floated plans[1] on Thursday to buy up most of the UK's existing internet infrastructures for an estimated cost of 20 billion (around $25 billion), which it pledged to massively expand. Amazon, Facebook and Google were named as companies that would be hit with new taxes to help pay for the scheme.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Britain's Labour party threatened billions of dollars in new taxes on large tech companies to fund the nationalization and expansion of the country's internet infrastructure if it wins the forthcoming general election. The party floated plans Thursday[3] night to spend a total of 20 billion (around $25 billion) to buy up most of the UK's existing internet infrastructure, which it pledged to then massively expand. It named Amazon, Facebook, and Google as companies it wants to hit with new taxes to help pay for the scheme. The plan is one of several proposals to nationalize private industries in the UK, which Labour hopes will help them win power in the upcoming general election, scheduled for December 12. The specifics of the funding were not absolutely clear. Labour said taxes on tech companies would be one of two funding streams for the plan. The other source of money is government borrowing. It said that as a result of the scheme, home internet access would be free, saving each household an average of 30 ($38) a month. Its total initial cost was pegged at around $25 billion \u2014 though the BBC reported[4] that the true cost could be as high as $50 billion. In addition there would be a recurring annual cost of around $300 million, Labour said, which would be \"more than covered\" by plans to reform tax laws to extract more money from multinationals. A video from Momentum, an activist group aligned with Labour, promoted the scheme after its launch. It also named Apple as a company that could be taxed to fund it.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1195250079143223296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This is HUGE #GeneralElection19[5] #FastandFree[6] #BritishBroadband[7] pic.twitter.com/WCeYje3ZU8[8]Labour said it would reform the system to tax large tech companies on their global profits rather than those registered in the UK. The party has criticized companies for structuring their companies in ways that send profits to low-tax jurisdictions and effectively avoid paying higher taxes in markets where their consumers are located. Labour said it would take an as-yet-undisclosed portion of worldwide profits, meant to reflect the company's footprint in the UK. Boris Johnson, the current UK Prime Minister, called the plan a \"crackpot scheme.\" His Conservative party also wants to invest in internet infrastructure, but within the existing framework of private companies.

Instead, it will thwart investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals from scaling their businesses, likely resulting in backlash from the industry.</p><p>And while EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager's support for a UK digital tax is encouraging, it has been mistaken as advocating for unilateral action. There are actually several caveats to her message, namely that national taxation on tech firms should be a step towards a coordinated international solution - not as a replacement for it.</p><p>In fact, with the EU set to pick up efforts towards a multilateral agreement should the OECD fail, the pressure on the UK to join forces with others is unlikely to dissipate any time soon.</p><p>And given the UK's imminent departure from the EU, a unilateral approach could put a potential trade deal with the US in jeopardy.</p><p>It is vital, then, that the UK remains open to its allies in the continent and beyond, and learns from the French that taxing big tech is better done in cooperation with others.</p><p>This would represent something of a policy U-turn, but the delay announced by the French in the hope of an OECD-sponsored agreement surely provides the UK with the precedent to backtrack.</p><p>After all, a hawkish, unilateral action will limit the UK's global potential. It will cause friction with allies and potentially have further ramifications for investors and tech companies that are already sceptical about a post-Brexit UK.</p><p>It is therefore of utmost importance that the new government remains a leading voice for regulating tech, but it should not do so at the expense of international collaboration. On the home front, aside from tax itself, this also means working with the private sector to understand how to protect small businesses and startups from the impact of tech giants.</p><p>Talks at Davos showed that there is an appetite for global collaboration on a digital tax, even from the US - with the UK acknowledging that this is the desired destination. Although pursuing a unilateral approach may show leadership, any pre-emptive measures from the UK would inevitably delay progress at an international level.</p><p>Instead, the UK must learn from the French experience, show faith in the OECD, and work towards a multilateral solution to what is an inherently global issue.</p><p>\u00a3 Russ Shaw is founder of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-157005671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3F-6WG1-JCBW-N2FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

Continue reading The UK s inquiry into fake news is focused on a long-dead bikini-finding app</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Saturday, the Observer published an article describing a rather incredible caper that took place in the United Kingdom. As part of an ongoing inquiry into fake news, Parliament seized a cache of documents obtained during legal discovery in a case mounted by an app developer against Facebook in an unrelated matter in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carole Cadwalladr, who rose to prominence this year as one of the journalists who broke the Cambridge Analytica story, has the tale:</p><p>Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn t hand over the documents.</p><p> We are in uncharted territory,  said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news.  This is an unprecedented move but it s an unprecedented situation. We ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest. </p><p>What, exactly, might be of interest here? In the Wall Street Journal, Deepa Seetharaman catches us up on Six4Three and why it s suing Facebook:</p><p>The Six4Three lawsuit stemmed from Facebook s decision in 2014 to stop giving outside developers broad access to information about users  friends. The move was a harsh blow to developers, forcing a number of apps to shut down, while Facebook argued it helped bolster user privacy.</p><p>Six4Three was the developer of an app called Pikinis, which allowed its users to find photos of Facebook users in bathing suits. It ceased operation in 2015 because of Facebook s decision to curtail access to its users  data, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>The 2014 changes were, of course, the ones designed to tamp down on the kind of invasive third-party data harvesting that would eventually come back to bite Facebook this year with the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>What makes the seizure of documents strange is that so little of the Cambridge Analytica story is, at this late date, in dispute. We know what data was made available to third-party developers before 2014. We know Facebook gradually became uncomfortable with how these developers were exploiting its users. We know they deliberated about it internally and eventually shut off the spigot.</p><p>Seetharaman suggests that it is these deliberations that are of interest to Collins. And perhaps some spicy emails will see the light of day. But it s hard to square the facts of the case with the way the document cache is presented in the Observer, which is as a development somewhere on the level of the Pentagon Papers.</p><p>And in any case, it remains unclear what 2014 data privacy discussions have to do with Collins  inquiry, which is supposed to be investigating the impact of fake news. The inquiry, which began in 2017, produced an interim report in July. Perhaps the document cache will link data privacy and fake news. Or perhaps a politician is simply casting about looking for new cudgels with which to beat Facebook in front of television cameras.</p><p>Collins  committee will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, and may discuss the cache of documents then. (Mark Zuckerberg was invited to go, and declined.) But as we waited for those internal communications to become public, a new court filing introduced a rather amazing twist.</p><p>Collins only got the documents because he was able to ascertain the hotel in which Ted Kramer, Six4Three s managing director, was staying during a business trip to London. And who told him that? Ryan Mac has the story in BuzzFeed:</p><p>Although Kramer concedes he does not know how the DCMS committee knew where he was staying in London, he suggests in a 19-page court filing made on Monday that Carole Cadwalladr, a freelance reporter at British outlet the Observer, had tipped off the committee to his hotel address so that it could obtain the documents. Kramer and his lawyers did not immediately respond to his request for comment. Cadwalladr also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Damian Collins declined to comment. [...]</p><p>The filing alleges that on November 17, 2018, during a phone conversation with Cadwalladr, Kramer told the reporter he would be on an unrelated business trip to London. According to the document,  she suggested they meet for her to receive another update on the case. Mr. Kramer agreed to meet with her at his hotel and sent her a calendar invitation with the address of the hotel. </p><p>Standards for journalistic ethics vary widely from country to country. In the United States, it would typically be frowned upon for a reporter to tip off a government body that a foreign national and source was coming to town and might be in possession of documents useful in an ongoing inquiry. At the very least, such an arrangement would require a prominent disclosure from the journalist were she ever to write about the seizure of those documents.</p><p>In any case, it certainly seemed possible on Monday that the contents of the document cache would amount to less than the Observer suggested   and that the story of how Collins obtained it might amount to much more.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook s Sheryl Sandberg Is Tainted by Crisis After Crisis</emphasis></p><p>Sarah Frier digs into the various ways Sandberg s standing has been hurt by two years of perma-crisis. This story inadvertently triggered a daylong debate on Twitter after Frier, citing Facebook, reported that the company s vaunted election war room had been shut down and replaced with a Friday-morning meeting. After I tweeted about it, Facebook s Guy Rosen tweeted back that the war room not only wasn t shutting down, but that it would expand. Then TechCrunch wrote about that.</p><p>Anyway, my unpopular opinion is that the war room was probably useful and not (just!) a PR stunt, and I m glad that the idea of a focused cross-functional teams sharing physical office space will endure into the future. My popular opinion is that Frier s story good and that you should read it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Information Attacks against Democracies</emphasis></p><p>Bruce Schneier has a new paper out that is highly relevant to our interests here. Here s a good, concise summary:</p><p>Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia s aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like Adrien Chen and Peter Pomerantsevdescribe in today s Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair. [...]</p><p>In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Memo from a  Facebook nation  to Mark Zuckerberg: You moved fast and broke our country.</emphasis></p><p>Kara Swisher interviews Maria Ressa, co-founder of the news site Rappler in the Philippines, who is facing 10 years in prison for honestly reporting on its authoritarian leader. She blames his rise, in part, on Facebook:</p><p>RESSA: President Duterte, in his second state of the nation address, in July of 2017, singles us out, he doesn t, he attacks the top television network but he singles us out and says,  This Rappler is foreign-owned or 100 percent owned by foreigners.  I couldn t help myself, because we were live. I automatically tweeted about it,  Mr. President, you re wrong.  I want my independence. This is part of the reason we set up Rappler. Then within a week the first investigations began. Then the cases came in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Russia accuses Google of failing to remove links to banned sites</emphasis></p><p>Russian state officials formally accused Google of breaking the law by not removing links to websites that are banned in the country, Colin Lecher reports:</p><p>The potential penalty that Google could face is minuscule for a company of its size: officials said in the statement that the search giant could only face fines of up to 700,000 roubles, or about $10,000. But Reuters reports that the Russian government has been considering more drastic actions, including fining companies up to 1 percent of annual revenue for failing to comply with similar laws. Russia has passed a series of laws in recent years that give the government more power to censor the web, and has clashed with major websites like Wikipedia over the rules.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google tightens political ad policies ahead of 2019 EU elections</emphasis></p><p>Google has announced it will publicize the identity of organizations paying for political ads during the 2019 EU Parliamentary Elections, Jon Porter reports, in a move that could address Facebook s dark money problem.</p><p>Any ad that mentions a political party, candidate, or office holder will have to tell users who paid for it, with Google also introducing a new process to verify these identities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google flouting EU competition ruling, say rival price comparison sites</emphasis></p><p>An EU ruling says Google has to give  equal treatment  to rival shopping sites. They ve written a letter saying the company is not meeting that condition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YouTube Lets California Fire Conspiracy Theories Run Wild</emphasis></p><p>YouTube has gotten better about removing conspiracy theories from top search results, but Caroline Haskins finds a miss on the California wildfires:</p><p>Currently, when a user starts typing  California fire  into YouTube, the top autocomplete search suggestions are  conspiracy 2018,   agenda 21,  and  laser beam,  all of which refer to conspiracy theories related to California s wildfires. Similarly, typing in  California wildfire  leads YouTube to suggest  lasers,   directed energy weapon,  and  dew,  which is an acronym for  directed energy weapon.  Simply typing  California fire  and searching it does return straightforward news coverage, which is an improvement over, say, the false flag and crisis actor conspiracies YouTube was surfacing about the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting earlier this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beijing to Judge Every Resident Based on Behavior by End of 2020</emphasis></p><p>Beijing will adopt  a lifelong points program  by 2021, assigning individual ratings to each resident, Bloomberg reports in a chilling story:</p><p>The capital city will pool data from several departments to reward and punish some 22 million citizens based on their actions and reputations by the end of 2020, according to a plan posted on the Beijing municipal government s website on Monday. Those with better so-called social credit will get  green channel  benefits while those who violate laws will find life more difficult.</p><p>The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy will be  unable to move even a single step,  according to the government s plan. Xinhua reported on the proposal Tuesday, while the report posted on the municipal government s website is dated July 18.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">America s Elite Universities Are Censoring Themselves on China</emphasis></p><p>American universities have many Chinese students and increasingly get a lot of funding from China, and increasingly they are biting their tongues for fear of aggravating the Communist Party, Isaac Stone Fish reports:</p><p>More often, the self-censorship is nuanced and difficult to detect.  You re not going to get a lot of China specialists openly confessing that self-censorship is a big problem,  said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California who is known for his critical stance toward the Chinese Communist Party. And yet Pei believes that those who communicate to non-academic audiences, particularly in the media, thus increasing the likelihood that the Chinese government will see their work, and those who work on sensitive issues like Tibet, must watch what they say.  You don t want to go out on a limb,  he said.  You want to come across as very measured.  Sounding  too strident,  he said, not only risks  the ire of the Chinese government but could also lose the respect of your peers, who value evidence above opinion.  Robert Barnett, who ran Columbia University s Modern Tibetan Studies Program from its founding in 1999 until stepping down in 2017, emphasized that Columbia never actively restricted his work, but that there was often  a very strong tendency within the university, and with many prestigious institutions in the U.S., not to include people who study the kind of subject I work on in any kind of academic collaborations in China or in dialogues with Chinese delegates. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No Refuge for Investors as 2018 Rout Sends Stocks, Bonds, Oil Lower</emphasis></p><p>Tech stocks keep dropping.

That s not to absolve online communities of the beliefs of their members. It s not to say digital spaces can t play a major role in ushering people toward violence.

This is why there need to be legal consequences for website hosts who refuse to take responsibility for moderating and blocking this content themselves.\"</p><p>BitChute is one of several platforms alarming those who monitor the far right.</p><p>Another, Gab, created in 2016, has a dedicated network of British users called \"Britfam\" that has 4,000 members and which far-right extremists use to circulate racism, antisemitism and Holocaust denial.</p><p>Last week the chief executive of Gab, Andrew Torba, sent an email to users attacking what he alleged was the \"anti-white, anti-Trump and anti-conservative bias\" on more mainstream social media platforms.</p><p>Torba wrote: \"If you are a conservative. If you are straight. If you are white. If you are a Christian: you should not be on Facebook, Twitter, or any other Big Tech product. Please understand: you are the enemy to these people. They hate you. They literally believe that you are a terrorist for wearing a Maga [Make America Great Again] hat. This isn't hyperbole.'</p><p>CST analysis found that the messaging service Telegram hosts images and posts celebrating the British terrorists Thomas Mair and David Copeland, and other far-right terrorists.</p><p>Billing itself as an alternative to Twitter, Parler is another social media platform rapidly gaining popularity, which describes itself as \"a non-biased free-speech driven entity\". Though not included in the CST report, it is increasingly synonymous with the alt-right. The political commentator Katie Hopkins moved to Parler after being permanently suspended from Twitter on 19 June for contravening its ban on \"hateful content\".</p><p>Within a week Hopkins had already accrued 215,000 of the platform's 1.2 million users. Extremism experts caution that deplatforming such individuals is akin to \"whack-a-mole\" in the sense that removing them from one platform often drives them to less regulated social media sites.</p><p>Frequently a person suspended from a major social media platform such as Facebook or Twitter gravitates on to smaller platforms that tolerate more extreme content and offer a licence to spread more toxic narratives and use increasingly inflammatory language.</p><p>On Saturday Hopkins used Parler to call on the government to \"stop the invasion\" when referring to small boat crossings of migrants.</p><p>Many of these newer platforms promote conspiracy theories about Jews and other minorities, according to the CST. A familiar trope is the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory, which alleges that Jewish organisations and synagogues are using mass immigration to undermine white western nations.</p><p>The CST analysis suggests that the filming and livestreaming of terrorist attacks has become an integral part of far-right planning, and successful perpetrators are celebrated and glorified via striking imagery and memes.</p><p>The authors of Hate Fuel say: \"Our report shows how a global movement of violent neo-Nazis uses social media to incite hatred, celebrate murder and turn terrorists into heroes. Far-right terrorism poses an urgent and lethal threat to Jews and other minority communities, and it is fuelled by a vast amount of online incitement hosted on websites that don't seem to care. We need a global effort by governments, law enforcement and the tech industry, similar to their previous response to Isis propaganda, to turn this around.\"</p><p>Ray Vahey, founder and chief executive of BitChute, defended the platform.</p><p>\"BitChute is a startup that's growing fast in a market that has been monopolised by YouTube,\" he said. \"It's very challenging, but we are having an impact and it's vital to consumers that companies like ours bring much-needed competition to a market like this.</p><p>\"One of the difficult challenges is moderation and this has been the case for Google as well. We continue to develop tools to ensure we can remove any content that does not meet our standards sooner.\"</p><p>BitChute said it had been in contact with UK counter-terrorism police and other organisations, who it believed could help it \"improve our processes\".</p><p>The platform said that while it shared the CST's goal of reducing violence, deplatforming \"the more extreme sides of the political spectrum\" pushes \"people to parts of the web where they could no longer experience a variety of viewpoints\".</p><p>When asked if he seriously defended his platform streaming videos of terrorist atrocities, Vahey did not respond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-63988359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607F-V901-JCJY-G09M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><timeReceived>8:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 28, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Luddite, i.e. a heretic in league with the Devil.Even worse, if that's possible, is declaring that technology is making our lives worse rather than better.There's an entire industry devoted to cherry-picking data to support the One True Faith of Technology: a new miracle drug (never mind the side-effects or the fact that the drug only works on a relative handful of patients), a new energy source that will generate nearly free energy in near-infinite quantities (thorium reactors, though there is not yet a single one that's operational), and the marketing of convenience: this new marketing gimmick will change your life--you can try on clothing in virtual reality, no need to go to the mall! Wow! Borrow more, buy more, throw more into the landfill--isn't technology wonderful?</p><p>Meanwhile, back in reality, the previous \"miracle drug,\" statins, turn out to be useless in reducing heart disease and actively reduce health via a vast array of negative side effects:Do statins really work? Who benefits? Who has the power to cover up the side effects?[1](europeanscientist.com)Heavily promoted \"miracle drugs\" make billions of dollars for the corporate owners, whether they actually improve health in the long-term or not. But the tech-will-fix-everything cheerleaders never get around to examining the spectacular failures of Big Pharma, or the catastrophic consequences of smartphone addiction (see chart below), or the impossibility of scaling technology without consuming vast amounts of resources which are already scarce.This excerpt from my new book explains the absurdity of the tech faithful's belief system:(The book isWill You Be Richer or Poorer? Profit, Power and A.I. in a Traumatized World[2].)The belief in the ultimate goodness and inevitability of technological advances is often presented as a binary choice: one either believes that technology will eventually solve every human problem, or one is anti-technology and anti-progress.Suggesting there are limits on technology is thus heretical: for believers, there are no limits.Let's set aside the false binary choice and ask: are there intrinsic limits to technology, and if so, are we approaching any of these limits?Technology cannot change the priorities and incentives of those who own it.Technology is only a tool, and people will use the tool to maximize their gain and optimize whatever incentives are embedded in the system. If chopping down irreplaceable tropical hardwood forests is optimized by the incentives to maximize profits, then that's how technology will be applied.Technology cannot repeal the laws of thermodynamics.Taking a pencil and extending the declining cost of solar panels to zero doesn't negate the physical costs of mining and smelting the ore, shipping the metal to a factory, fabricating the photovoltaic cells, assembling and testing the panels, transporting them to the installation site on vehicles that are expensive to manufacture and maintain, installing the panels, wiring them to inverters and other equipment, testing the system onsite, and returning to perform maintenance and possibly repairs. Since the expected life of the installed panels is 20 to 25 years, the entire expense must be repeated, plus the additional expense of removing and recycling the worn out panels.The cost of manufacturing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing the panels will never be close to zero due to the intrinsic costs in mining, smelting, refining, milling, transporting, assembling, testing, installing, maintaining and repairing the panels--not to mention getting rid of the toxic components when the panels must be replaced.Even if robots perform all the work, robots are themselves resource- and energy-intensive.Robots are less like a computer chip (with declining marginal costs), and more like a car, an immensely complex and costly assembly of intrinsically resource-intensive components, electronics, computer chips and millions of lines of software coding.Autos cost more than they did a generation ago for all these reasons. As cheap-to-access resources such as metals and minerals are depleted, the remaining ores are more costly to extract; regulations require additional safety features, and extremely complex software is increasingly prone to unanticipated errors.All of these realities apply to autos, robots and every other complex, resource-intensive machinery.To become more capable, machines become more complex and therefore more expensive to manufacture, test, maintain and repair.In a very telling edit of reality, those extolling the idea that robots will perform all of humanity's work in the near future overlook these intrinsic costs, and overlook the expensive realities of fixing even simple machines when they fail or break down.Consider the following example: a clothes dryer.A clothes dryer is basically a metal box containing a heating element and a drum that spins. An electronic board with a digital display operates the machine''s cycles and controls. A dryer is thus far less complex than a robot, especially a robot that is capable of navigating the real world.The dryer control board is relatively simple:a handful of low-cost commodity computer chips and a few circuit boards. Despite the relative simplicity, these boards fail with alarming regularity. This is also true of the electronics in ranges, washing machines and other appliances. The replacement board for the dryer is one-third the cost of a new dryer. Labor adds another third,so replacing the board is two-thirds the cost of a new dryer.This reliance on cheap commodity electronic components results in the lifespan of modern appliances being measured in years rather than the decadesof use formerly expected of purely mechanical appliances.The ultimate cost of adding features (the functional value of which is often very much in question) is far higher than the sticker price of the new dryer. In the real world, technology has increased costs and consumed more resources for extremely marginal improvements (for example, ten choices of drying cycles rather than five).Since advocates of robots claim robots will soon do all the work of humanity,consider the vast difference in costbetween a robot that operates on a flat factory floor, repetitively attaching one part on a dryer assembly line, versus a robot that arrives onsite in the messy real world and is able to diagnose and repair a broken dryer.The factory model operates on a flat floor; the repair robot has to navigate an irregular driveway and multiple changes in floor level. It also has to be powerful enough to lift the dryer off the washer (in a stacked configuration), move it to open ground, remove the top, perform the diagnostics, remove the defective board, retrieve the new board, install it correctly, re-assemble the case, test the repaired machine, then lift it back onto the washer.To repair a dryer onsite, the robot will have to have the strength of a small forklift and a very high level of dexterity and precision motor control. The cost of adding each of these capabilities to a robot is extremely non-trivial, and it won't ever drop to near-zero. Rather, it will only increase in cost even if commodity sensors and chips decline in price. The points of potential failure will proliferate with each new capability and each new level of complexity.Finally, note that the robot itself is prone to the same kinds of failures that it is designed to repair,but due to its much greater complexity, repairing the repair robot could cost an order of magnitude more than just having a knowledgeable human repair the dryer.I've performed this exact repair on my own dryer (only a few years old), and other similar repairs on other appliances: a name-brand range that turned on the oven at random times due to a failed low-cost commodity electronic sensor (less than two years old), and an expensive name-brand heavy-duty washing machine, less than a year old, that also failed due to a low-cost electronic sensor.Complex devices are only as reliable and durable as their lowest-quality component.This is as true of robots as it is for any other device.Yet even with me performing the labor, the parts for all these appliance repairs were expensive.Many less-handy people would have paid multiples of this already-high cost just for labor, while others would have bought a new appliance and had the (still-functional other than the one failed component) appliance hauled to the landfill--a perfect example of our wasteful and expensiveLandfill Economy.Consider the hundreds of components in a so-calledsmart homedesigned to save energy and offer more convenienceby networking sensors, cameras, appliances, locksets, servers, controllers, Wi-Fi chips and software.The projected advances in security and convenience, many of which are questionable (e.g. just how much value is really added by a refrigerator that can order a quart of milk delivered once it detects a low level in the carton?) come at a very high cost in components, installation, service and repairs, because each of the hundreds of sensors, controllers, Wi-Fi chips are points of potential failure--not to mention the risk of unauthorized remote access.How long will these components last? How long before they must be replaced to function with a new software system? How functional will the system be if even one controller fails?Given the extraordinary expense of installing and maintain this complex system and the marginal returns in convenience and security,how is this not another system destined for the landfill?I have yet to find a true believer inrobots will do all the work of humanitywho has ever performed even a single repair of a complex system or device caused by a failed board, chip, sensor or software bug - and done so not on a clean factory floor but in the unpredictable real world.I've also never yet met an avid believer inrobots will do all the work of humanitywho has designed, prototyped, tested, manufactured, sold, maintained and repaired robots capable of climbing (or landing) on a roof, diagnosing the cause of a failed solar array, replacing the failed part and cleaning the panels, all for a total system cost that's less than the relatively modest cost of a human repair person.Technology can't fix what's broken, because what's broken is our entire system.For more on this heresy,please check out the first section of my new book (free PDF)[3]If you have an appetite for more heresy:read at your own risk....Vaclav Smil: 'Growth must end. Our economist friends don't seem to realise that[4]': \"The economists will tell you we can decouple growth from material consumption, but that is total nonsense. The options are quite clear from the historical evidence. If you don't manage decline, then you succumb to it and you are gone.\"Ronald Wright: Can We Still Dodge the Progress Trap?[5]: Societies that failed were seduced and undone by what I called a progress trap: a chain of successes which, upon reaching a certain scale, leads to disaster. The dangers are seldom seen before it's too late. The jaws of a trap open slowly and invitingly, then snap closed fast.Technocracy, Luddism, and the Environmental Crisis[6]: The green movement needs to think about social power just as much as about technology.I believe the roots of the environmental crisis lie as much in the technocratic attitude towards nature expressed in Western cultures and technologies as in the capitalist drive for profit, growth, and accumulation. The power of industrial-capitalism is that its technological, social, and economic values mutually reinforce one another.The Net Energy Pincer[7]: Prior investment and psychological attachment prevent us from starting again from scratch. Instead, we employ ever more complex (and expensive) work-arounds in an attempt to make systems, institutions and infrastructure achieve things that they were not designed to do (such as keeping people alive into their 90s or providing 24/7 electricity using solar panels).Climate Change and Technology (via LaserLefty)[8]: The question that isn't being asked: what will the adverse consequences of these (alternative energy) technologies be? Climate change and mass extinction weren't even imagined as consequences of the technologies that produced them. And again, a central drawback of the technologies being developed to address climate change is that they will adversely impact species loss and mass extinction. If the 'solution' to climate change means a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, what is to be gained by implementing it?To decarbonize we must decomputerize: why we need a Luddite revolution[9]: Big tech claims AI and digitization will bring a better future. But putting computers everywhere is bad for people and the planet. We are often sold a similar bill of goods: big tech companies talk incessantly about how AI and digitization will bring a better future. In the present tense, however, putting computers everywhere is bad for most people. It enables advertisers, employers and cops to exercise more control over us \u20ac' in addition to helping heat the planet. My recent books:Will You Be Richer or Poorer?
