There's nothing else,\" said Andreas Mundt, head of the monopoly authority in Germany (Jann Hufer for The New York Times)<br/>LONDON \u2014 Recently, the head of antitrust authority in Germany, Andreas Mundt, asked a room full of lawyers, academics and regulators to imagine a wall with all the personal information that Had gathered from them Facebook and Google. Mundt told them to imagine it being crowded with their data divided into categories such as finance, location, relationships and hobbies.</p><p><br/>\"That's you, \" remarked Mundt. \"And I promise you that wall knows you better than your wife.\"<br/>Few were the ones who listened to Mundt when, a few years ago, he began to make warnings about the information gathered by the giants of the technology sector. According to Mundt, although online services like Facebook and Google did not charge a penny, people paid a heavy price for giving companies such a large amount of personal details. Moreover, people had no choice but, as the companies did not have real competition.<br/>However, in February, his agency decreed that Facebook had violated the laws of the country and demanded that the company automatically stop sharing data between the services it owns, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its like and share buttons. It was the first resolution of its kind in Europe, in which ideas that were often discussed in the debates of academia and research centres were put into practice.<br/>As U.S. regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny around big tech companies, there is a debate about whether and how they could accuse these firms of violating antitrust laws. Regulators often investigate whether a company has caused harm to the consumer\u2014 a rule that can be difficult to prove when it comes to free services.<br/>Mundt's answer is simple. The only way to take over Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: information.<br/>According to Mundt, companies are so dominant in their core activities that, if consumers want to search the internet or be on a social network, they have no choice but to share their personal data. Thus, the information further strengthens the position that technology companies have on their rivals and, therefore, that is an anti-competitive action, Mundt said.<br/>The companies have vigorously fought this argument. However, it is gaining acceptance in antitrust circles, while Mundt, who has led Germany's antitrust agency for nearly a decade, urges officials from other nations to take the same path.<br/>After the ruling against Facebook, Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to talk about that idea. Mundt helped organize a meeting with fellow officials of the monopoly authority in Colombia, where they spent four days debating regulations aimed at the technology sector. U.S. officials such as Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, director of the Justice Department's monopoly division, were some of the attendees.<br/>\"The German authority is much more advanced in thisissue and in real terms is the world's leading antitrust authority on these technological issues,\" said Thomas Vinje, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels and a veteran of antitrust battles with the industry technology involving Microsoft and Google.<br/>Other regulators seek to build on Germany's strategy. The European Commission is in the early stages of an investigation to Facebook, which includes the use of the signature data, mentioned a person familiar with the inquiry who spoke with the condition that he maintained his anonymity.<br/>Online platforms often collect data about users: what they click, how quickly a person passes through a post, or what video a user stops to see. Information helps a company like Facebook infer features about interests, personal contacts, and financial demographics in order to better target advertising, or train machine learning algorithms that are can be used in future products.<br/>It's an extraordinarily lucrative business model. With advertising, Facebook earned $55 billion last year, while Google's ad sales gave it a total of $116 billion.<br/>A billboard in San Francisco for Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign (Justin Kaneps for The New York Times)<br/>Regulators' anguish stems from the lack of new competitors, a trend Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and the wealth of financial resources it has. According to Mundt, Facebook controls more than 95 percent of the social media market in Germany. With no competition, the social network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing decision, between agreeing to have an unlimited amount of their data together or not using Facebook at all.<br/>When they investigated Facebook, German regulators created a map of the information the company collects. It closely resembled the one Mundt described during his recent speech: a web of personal information that was divided into details about home management, life events, politics, and buyer behavior.<br/>Mundt argues that Facebook and other tech giants need not be divided, as Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested. In any case, Mundt believes that governments should limit their ability to collect data. The strategy can have a similar effect to a split by isolating a company's different services.<br/>\"The business model is to collect and process data, endpoint. There's nothing else,\" Mundt said in an interview. \"If they don't have the data, they can have ten thousand very smart engineers tell them what to do with the information, but without the data they can achieve nothing.\"<br/>Among regulators and policy makers around the world, Germany is at the forefront of a deeper understanding that laws must evolve to keep pace with technological change. The rules that regulate industries such as oil or transport, where dominance is measured in physical products and abusive price increases, cannot be used so easily in services that are digital, are often free and depend on attention and Thepeople's data rather than infrastructure.<br/>Some criticize Germany's aggressive strategy because they believe it extends the boundaries of antitrust law and will not resist prosecutions in court. Other people believe that Mundt's position on data is too simplistic and, if widely adopted, will make it difficult to offer free services. Because data is widely shared across different businesses and industries, attempts to limit their flow will cause accidental consequences and alterations, according to critics.<br/>\"European regulators are using competition policy to achieve non-competitive goals,\" said Eline Chivot, a senior analyst based in Brussels who works for the Center for Data Innovation, a group that founded a Washington research center, which has representatives from Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft on its board of directors. \"It creates uncertainty.\"<br/>Facebook is appealing Germany's decision, on the grounds that it was transparent with users as to how data is collected. The social network argues that the use it gives to data helps improve the service and that German regulators direct their attacks against Facebook even if it is a common practice throughout the internet.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">*Copyright: c.2019 New York Times News Service</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7603845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ5-RBC1-F03R-W3XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1217\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company was fined about $2.7 billion by the European Commission last June after the watchdog group said it abused its dominance as a search engine by giving itself an advantage in comparison shopping services. Googleparent company Alphabet appealed in September.</p><p>But the notion that in 2018 these \"expos\u00e9s\" are still mind-blowing news is nothing short of ridiculous. Of course these companies have almost untouchable positions in their respective markets. It's dumb to have ever thought any differently. Googleand its parent company Alphabet are taking the heat for a phenomenon that implicates nearly every big tech company, including Microsoft Corp.  , Amazon.com Inc.  , Apple Inc.  and Facebook Inc.  . </p><p>Let's start with Amazon. The company has executed acquisitions into new verticals like  That has sent shockwaves throughout the grocery store industry. Amazon has a top production studio, a surging cloud services business, an unrivaled retail business and more. Who else can say they do as much under one Bezos-like banner, and do it with such success that makes rivals shake in their boots?</p><p>With such heft, Amazon in many cases is able to set prices in the market. It's retail ruthlessness and it's subsequent ability to put rivals out of business is now legendary. </p><p>\"The Amazon people are pretty smart in that what they're acquiring are not horizontal competitors,\" said Rob Baumann, chair of the economics department at the College of the Holy Cross. \"These large firms -- they merge smartly.\"</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Imagine attempting to create an alternative to Amazon today. Even if you had the best backing from the best venture capitalists and the best value-adding ideas, trying to dethrone Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos would be like David versus Goliath, but with a much different ending.</p><p>\"I think if you look at the classic view of a monopoly, you could argue that they are not because prices aren't going up per say,\" said Bill Friend, managing director and VP of North America at Fluent Commerce. \"But they're establishing a level of control that is unprecedented.\"</p><p>Because of that, Friend explained, it could soon be high time to establish a new sense of what a monopoly is. These tech companies don't meaningfully drive prices higher for consumers, but they absolutely raise the barrier to entry to impossible to jump over heights.</p><p>Now take Facebook. When CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress last month following the  , one of his most tenuous moments came as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) asked if there was an alternative to Facebook for users upset with the platform. Zuckerberg tossed out some statistics and danced around the question before Graham explicitly asked, \"You don't think you have a monopoly?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's response? \"It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.\" Not exactly keeping it real, Zuck.</p><p>The reason Zuckerberg couldn't name a competitor is because there isn't another company that does exactly what Facebook does and does it at its scale. Twitter  just tweets, while Snapchat  just snaps vanishing photos and text.</p><p>Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users, and it's still growing.

And it continues to do so, rather aggressively. In just about a decade, we have seen unprecedented changes in the way we work, relate to each other or live our lives. It is also seen as a blessing to boost business, enhance governance and create jobs.   However, there is something about smartphones and social media applications that most users are unaware of \u2013 the deliberate design considerations to steal away our attention. It\u2019s a common sight today to find people glued to their phones; some must be doing useful work but many are trapped, in a cycle of activities as varied and endless as the samsara. A study conducted by a group of doctors in 2017 found that at least 40 percent adolescents in Bhutan are addicted to the internet which is amongst the highest internet-addiction rates in the South East Asian region (Kuensel, 13 Nov. 2018).       We advise our children or office subordinates to reduce their social media time. Some parents regulate the number of hours each day their children get to use their smartphones. Some offices block certain social media sites. Training organizers and meeting moderators often require participants to switch off their phones or to put them in silent mode. In general, there is a lot of advocacy against the excessive use of smartphones or social media. We do all this because it has become extremely difficult for many to pay undivided attention to important matters in life without being distracted. We are having an attention crisis triggered by digital technology.    Attention is a focused mental engagement in something. And as American writer Matthew Crawford puts it, \u201cAttention is a scarce resource and a person has only so much of it\u201d. With the unimaginable quantum of information and content available online, attention becomes even more scarce. \u201cAcknowledging the value of attention provides the framework for the argument that we should be more aware of what we focus on while using digital technology\u201d (Matthew Crawford).    We are experiencing the real dynamics of what economists and social scientists call the \u201cattention economy\u201d. We are living through times where there is an overwhelming flow of information and content, and proportionate demand on our attention. But because our attention stock is as limited as the number of hours in a day, or lesser, the information over-load increases the risk of people choosing breadth over depth, rendering us half-baked experts or Jack of all trades. We read too much and learn too little.    This \u201cbreadth over depth\u201d phenomenon affects everyone but it assumes special relevance and importance for students. His Majesty The King always emphasizes on the need for our youth to work hard, become knowledgeable and talented, and to strive for excellence in whatever they do. If most of our attention is consumed by whatever the internet, smartphones and social media have to offer, with little or no attention to spare for the more important things, we risk becoming a society with a high literacy rate but lacking in deep knowledge, expertise and talent. We need to reduce distractions, and learn to invest our attention wisely. We need awareness.    At the root of the attention crisis is economics, and a great deal of psychology. Digital technology developers, platform providers and content designers, know very well that the success of their product depends on the kind of user experience they are able to create or on how much attention they are able to persuade users to afford to their product or platform. Because, at the end of the day, that is where the money comes from.    \u201cBig tech now employs mental health experts to use persuasive technology, a new field of research that looks at how computers can change the way humans think and act. This technique, also known as persuasive design, is built into thousands of games and apps, and companies like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft rely on it to encourage specific human behaviour starting from a very young age. Some health professionals believe children\u2019s behaviours are being exploited in the name of the tech world\u2019s profit\u201d (Chavie Lieber, Vox, Aug 2018).    Further, tech companies today have access to data pertaining to the behaviors, preferences, choices and trends of billions of users which helps them craft new strategies to retain old users and attract new ones. Users, for the most part, are completely oblivious of this fact. \u201cThere is also a lack of awareness about the digital distractions designed with persuasive psychology to trap our attention\u201d (Kristen M. Liu, 2019).    That most people, particularly youth, do not have the awareness that technology developers are after their attention is the missing ingredient in our advocacy efforts against the excessive use of the internet, smartphones or social media. If we know the reasons behind, the likelihood of being able to show restraint could be higher. More Bhutanese youth then are likely to spend lesser time on Instagram or TikTok.    Another important aspect of digital technologies that makes users inseparable from their gadgets is the User Experience (UX) design considerations employed by the developers. Aided by User Interface (UI) design features, UX design is focussed on enhancing the overall experience and satisfaction of the user. American researcher and professor, Don Norman who coined the term User Experience wrote, \u201cProducts were once designed for the functions they performed. But when all companies can make products that perform their functions equally well, the distinctive advantage goes to those who provide pleasure and enjoyment while maintaining the power\u201d (Don Norman, 2020).    While ethical, well-intended UX/UI designs can make our experiences in today\u2019s highly digital world purposeful and pleasurable at the same time, there is a growing concern over what London-based UX designer Harry Brignull termed as \u201cDark Patterns\u201d. Dark patterns are deceptive UX/UI design features used in websites or Apps that mislead or trick users to do things they don\u2019t mean to, or want to, do \u2013 like making a purchase or subscribing to something or sharing personal information. \u201cIn order to generate more sales, get subscriptions and hit target numbers in transactions etc., designers and business associates started creating deceiving user interfaces to manipulate users\u201d (Arushi Jaiswal, The UX Collective, 2010).    Companies as prominent as LinkedIn have been sued in court and made to pay compensation to affected users for using dark patterns. Lawmakers in the US introduced a bill in the Congress to prohibit dark patterns because such deceptive practices are becoming a little too rampant in the tech world. There is increasing concern around dark patterns given the exploitative intentions of its usage for profit-making by businesses at the cost of the user\u2019s interest, attention, security and privacy. The website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.darkpatterns.org\">www.darkpatterns.org</url> gives a very good understanding of dark patterns.    Websites, Apps and social networking platforms today offer a plethora of contents, adequately punctuated by advertisements placed strategically to divert our attention.      And it\u2019s often hard to ignore them because they are designed to attract our attention in the first place, willingly or otherwise. \u201cWhen individuals give their attention to advertisements and branding, intentionally or unintentionally, they become a part of a digital labour force. By viewing and interacting with content, one is giving power and authority to the platform that released it\u201d (Matthew Crawford).    And that is how it works. In cyberspace, clicks, likes and views are all that matter. Because users who click, like or view your advertisement, or your postings for that matter, are either customers or potential future customers, fans or followers. With about 2.7 billion active users on Facebook, 1 billion on Instagram, and 330 million on Twitter worldwide every month, online platforms are not only huge marketplaces but also great avenues to showcase oneself. And once we are on such platforms, everyone is after each other\u2019s attention; attention is the currency that keeps the cyberspace marketplace running.    The fact that designers behind websites, smartphones and social media platforms are exploiting human attention by designing immersive and distractive features is a growing concern around the world, particularly amongst insiders of the tech world.      Tristan Harris, a former Design Ethicist at Google, is one such activist fighting to bring reforms in tech world that is increasingly creating platforms with extractive business models to capture human attention. In 2013, Harris created a presentation titled \u201cA Call to Minimize Distraction &amp; Respect Users\u2019 Attention\u201d and circulated amongst a few co-workers within Google. \u201cThe 141-slide deck was eventually viewed by tens of thousands of Google employees and sparked conversations about the company\u2019s responsibilities long after he left the company\u201d. (Wikipedia). In one of the slides, Harris wrote \u201cDistraction matters to me because time is all I have in life\u201d. He also wrote \u201cNever before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers, working at 3 companies \u2013 Google, Apple and Facebook \u2013 had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention\u201d.    Jeff Orlowski, director of the documentary \u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d describes the attention crisis created by digital technology as a \u201cclimate change-scale problem\u201d. \u201cThe Social Dilemma, explores and animates a philosophical shift in Silicon Valley: that the tech industry\u2019s tools, most predominantly social media, aren\u2019t promising tools but too-powerful entities fragmenting attention and rewiring brains by design; that addiction to phones and social media is a function of their business model; that this divisive, degrading status quo is driving us straight to dystopia\u201d (The Guardian, 8 Sept. 2020).    With the raging coronavirus pandemic showing no signs of subsiding, hundreds of millions of people around the world continue to be confined to their homes. And with business, education, politics and communication now happening increasingly over the internet, the concerns emanating from the ill-effects of digital technology are escalating. And there is increasing pressure on tech companies to reform. \u201cNow is the moment for tech platforms to step into the public responsibility that the present emergency demands. The pandemic gives us a chance to convert online lawlessness into humane and regenerative technology\u201d (Milken Institute, April 2020).    There are many important things in life, and more purposeful goals to pursue, that need our time and attention. The internet, smartphones or social media should be treated and used as tools that can make our lives more enriching, and help us achieve our individual and collective goals, rather than allowing ourselves to be consumed by them. If we are unaware, and unmindful, some of these tools can render us completely oblivious of the real world outside, the challenges we need to tackle and the goals we need to accomplish.    \u201cNobody on their death bed ever looked back and said I wished I\u2019d spent more time on Facebook\u201d, says design ethicist James Williams, in his Ted Talk \u201cStand Out of Our Light\u201d. We need to (be able to) differentiate between what is important and what is not, or what matters and what doesn\u2019t, and accordingly invest our attention. We need to leverage technology to its fullest potential of bringing good to human society by being aware, and by paying attention to where attention is most needed.

According to the Communications Workers of America[1], AT&amp;#38;T says it's laying off 3,400 technician and clerical jobs across the country over the next few weeks. They're also shutting down over 250 AT&amp;#38;T Mobility and Cricket Wireless stores, which will eliminate another 1,300 retail jobs. While many will imply these layoffs are due to COVID-19, they're simply part of a longstanding workforce reduction effort at AT&amp;#38;T. According to the union, AT&amp;#38;T has now eliminated 41,000 positions since receiving a $42 billion Trump tax cut[2]. The CWA conveniently provided a chart, drawn from AT&amp;#38;T earnings reports and filings, that show what AT&amp;#38;T's been up to: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/xjU9j52\">https://imgur.com/xjU9j52</url> The problem: AT&amp;#38;T's CEO Randall Stephenson went on live television in 2017[3] and insisted that the Trump tax cut would result in \"thousands of high paying jobs\":\"These are not entry-level jobs. These are 7,000 jobs of people putting fiber in ground, hard hat jobs that make $70,000 to $80,000 per year...'I cannot overstate how important I think a tax bill that makes the US corporate taxes a competitive regime around the world \u2014 that's big. That's significant.\"That, of course, never happened. And analysis of the Trump tax cut has made it clear that other than making a lot of rich folks notably richer, the cuts accomplished jack shit. Not only did the package not pay for itself[4], the economic boost it provided was short lived and negligible[5]. And, one has to think, the money thrown at the nation's biggest corporations would certainly have come in handy during a raging pandemic with 45 million unemployed Americans and an endless parade of struggling startups and small businesses. Granted that was just one of AT&amp;#38;T's many promises. AT&amp;#38;T also repeatedly claimed that the FCC's decision to neuter its authority over telecom (of which the net neutrality was only a small part) would result in unprecedented job growth and network investment. Again, the exact opposite happened[6], just like the last dozen times[7] AT&amp;#38;T lobbyists have played this game in DC (BellSouth merger, net neutrality repeal, FCC broadband privacy rule repeal, fiber deployment subsidies). Every, single time AT&amp;#38;T wants something (merger approval, deregulation, subsidies, tax breaks) it promises the Earth, sea and sky. And every, single time, the company fails to deliver and nobody on any level is held accountable. Ever. Nobody, in either party of the U.S. government, has taken any serious steps to thwart this idiotic gravy train (especially those myopically and often performatively focused on \"big tech\"). Meanwhile, about 90% of the coverage from \"he said, she said\" media outlets excludes this grift rodeo as essential context. AT&amp;#38;T receiving countless billions in tax cuts, subsidies, and regulatory FCC favors in exchange for absolutely fucking nothing is the story. Yet that's simply[8] not mentioned[9] at all by most large outlets, despite the fact that AT&amp;#38;T's bullshit promises haven't even been scrubbed from the company's website yet[10]. While COVID-19 will likely provide cover, AT&amp;#38;T's real motivation lies elsewhere. The company spent so much money on megamergers (DirecTV in 2015, Time Warner in 2018) it's drowning in debt. And while these acquisitions were supposed to help the company dominate the streaming video and mobile video ad sectors, the company's actually been losing video subscribers hand over fist[11]. In part due to rate hikes imposed on consumers to recoup said debt. It's an ouroboros of dysfunction caused by high-level executives, but as usual consumers and workers get to pay the real bill.

President Donald Trump has (TWTR), putting tech giants in legal and regulatory crosshairs that are likely to outlast the current election cycle.Democrats and Republicans alike voice increasing antipathy over sweeping liability protections that 230 affords to all online platforms \u2014 including (FB), , YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL). All told, experts say it\u2019s becoming clear that change is coming.\u201cIf Trump is reelected, frankly even if he isn\u2019t reelected, you might see variations on this proposal coming into some type of effect next year, with a shocking level of bipartisan support,\u201d Florida\u2019s former consumer protection czar, Richard Lawson, told Yahoo Finance recently. It\u2019s happened before. Back in 2018, bipartisan action on Section 230 created a carve out that removed immunity for user content promoting or facilitating sex trafficking of minors.   \u201cThe fact that they would come together is huge,\u201d Lawson said, speaking of the 2018 change.  In the wake of ongoing efforts by lawmakers and the Trump administration to claw back the protections, some say that\u2019s reason enough for all companies with an online presence to seriously assess the cost of the law\u2019s potential makeover.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of liability at risk,\u201d according to Rob McDowell, a former Federal Communications Commissioner (FCC) under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and partner at Cooley LLP.  \u2018Something\u2019s probably going to happen\u2019Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks during an oversight hearing to examine the Federal Communications Commission on June 24, 2020 in Washington,DC. - The hearing was held by the Senate Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation. (Photo by Alex Wong / POOL / AFP) (Photo by ALEX WONG/POOL/AFP via )The Trump administration has twice targeted Section 230 in the space of a month. The first was a controversial executive order that, in theory, would hand power to the FCC to reinterpret the statute; the second was via legislative \u201creform proposals\u201d published by the Department of Justice (DOJ).Yet independent of what the president may or may not accomplish, Congress is also growing restive, with Democrats and Republicans teaming up on bills to address the law\u2019s perceived shortcomings. In June, Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Thune (R-SD) introduced the \u201cPACT Act,\u201d which would expose platforms to federal civil claims, and allow users to appeal a platform\u2019s moderation actions.Separately, the Senate\u2019s \u201cEARN IT Act\u201d \u2014 introduced by South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham (R-SC), with backing from Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal and other Democrats \u2014 is headed to the full Senate for debate.The measure seeks to remove the liability shield for platforms that fail to meet standards for preventing sexual exploitation of children by the government or platforms. However, security and privacy experts argue the bill\u2019s stated purpose is a backdoor way to rob platforms and their users of encrypted communication.  House Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) has said he\u2019s working on legislation that would impose additional responsibility on companies earning more than $1 billion in annual revenue. In February, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) introduced legislation that would remove liability protections for Big Tech companies that knowingly publish false political advertisements.All of which suggests that the writing appears to be on the wall, according to Cooley\u2019s McDowell \u2014 especially as a mix of political bedfellows join forces.  \u201cIf you have Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Mark Warner, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Sen. Mike Lee, all coming together...something\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d he said.  Change that could be costly Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYNew changes are unlikely before next year. Yet platforms across industries can count on a host of rising compliance costs if user content must be policed more aggressively \u2014 and to defend against ensuing lawsuits.\u201cThe cost of [platforms] actually having to meet the level of granularity that\u2019s expected by some of these regulators -- that\u2019s where the tension lies,\u201d Peter Hyun, a Section 230 expert and partner at Wiley LLP who once served as chief counsel to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).  Legal experts say it\u2019s unclear how big of a war chest companies will need, as it would depend on the nature of a platform\u2019s business, and how significantly any changes shift liability.  While it\u2019s hard to put numbers on it, big platforms \u201ccould potentially be facing millions of dollars in damages costs, depending on what the actual changes to the law are, and they could be spending millions of dollars on increased moderation costs,\u201d according to James Rosenfeld, an attorney who handles defense of 230 claims for major media and tech companies, and previously for Yahoo Finance.  He explained that from a defense perspective, one advantage of 230 is it wipes out the bulk of user-generated, content-based claims in the early stages of litigation.  \u201cSo it cuts your bills a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a single case goes forward, it could be several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars to defend.\u201dAdditional responsibility would require platforms to scale up on content moderation. , for example, pays around that make between $16 and $18 per hour. Collectively, they wade through around 3 million posts per day.Meanwhile, back in 2017, Google announced plans to build out its moderation team with at least 10,000 by 2018. And according to Reuters, \u2019s content moderation arm is comprised of about 1,500 workers.\u2018A monumental shift\u2019Jade Giltrap, head of the media coverage team for cyber insurance provider CFC, explained that even under the current wide-ranging shield, platforms do purchase coverage for claims arising from user-generated content. That includes coverage for defamation, duty of care, intellectual property, and privacy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a defense, not a right,\u201d Giltrap said of the practical application of 230. Accordingly, \u201cthe law\u2019s protection doesn\u2019t kick in from a monetary perspective until a company needs to invoke it as a defense.\u201d  Premiums to defend such claims vary widely, and depend on a platform\u2019s revenue, level of reliance on user-generated content, and lawsuit history. Big Tech platforms that do rely heavily on user generated content, Giltrap said, would tend to face higher premiums. However, they also tend to curb coverage costs through self-insurance and robust in-house legal teams that handle smaller claims, she said.  She added that an errors and omissions policy with a $10 million cap can run well into six figures for a larger online platform, and around $7,500 to $10,000 for small firms. But all that would change under a less comprehensive 230 liability shield.  \u201cWhere these platforms stop becoming only a conduit, and become responsible for most or all of the content on on their platforms, that is a monumental shift, because it doesn't allow for them to adequately control that risk,\u201d Giltrap said. \u201cThey can't control all of their content that moves through their sites.\u201d moderation responsibility is exactly what most proposals to amend 230 have in mind.  Under the DOJ\u2019s proposals, platforms would face civil liability if they purposefully facilitate third party content that violates federal criminal law.  According to Wiley\u2019s Hyun, one problem with that standard is that it tasks platforms with identifying potentially criminal content, as well as guessing what users intended when they posted it. That\u2019s because criminal violations depend on the state of mind of the alleged violator, he said.  A cyberstalking threat posted to social media, for example, could be an obvious threat to the perpetrator who posted it, yet undetectable as such by platform moderators.  Even for experienced prosecutors and investigators, Hyun said that \u201cpainstaking\u201d effort goes into uncovering enough evidence to allege the level of intent required for a single criminal lawsuit to go forward, based on a user\u2019s online speech.  \u201cThat makes it incredibly difficult when you then try to assign that role to a company,\u2019\u201d Hyun said.   The DOJ also wants to permit civil suits against platforms for content-based claims that address a broad array of cyber crimes, and permit government-initiated civil enforcement actions to \u201cprotect citizens from harmful and illicit content.\u201cThe department also aims to remove the phrase \u201cotherwise objectionable\u201d \u2014 something that\u2019s long given platforms liability-free wiggle room to perform \u201cgood faith\u201d content moderation. A redefinition of \u201cgood faith\u201d would mean only moderation that adheres to a platform\u2019s own terms of service.Trump\u2019s Executive OrderThis illustration photo shows a woman in Los Angeles looking at the official account of US President Donald Trump on June 23, 2020, with a tweet by the president which considered \"abusive\" and hid it. - on Tuesday hid a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he threatened to use \"serious force\" against protestors in the US capital, saying it broke rules over abusive content. The move appeared to be the first by against the president for an \"abusive\" tweet. In a growing dispute, the platform has recently labeled other Trump tweets as misleading and violating its standards on promoting violence. (Photo by - / AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via )Trump\u2019s executive order takes a different approach. It looks to hand power to the FCC to reinterpret and issue rules for Section 230, and to the FTC to police content moderation under its authority to enforce unfair and deceptive trade practices.Because 230 extends no authority to either agency, McDowell said efforts to carry out the executive order would probably face legal challenges. On the other hand, the agencies, both independent of the executive branch, could choose to ignore the order altogether.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want the FCC to legislate,\u201d McDowell said. Absent action by the FCC, the FTC could still pursue enforcement action that could prove costly for platforms to defend, even though the agency lacks effective tools for penalizing alleged bad actors, according to McDowell.  Although some proposals to weaken 230 protections may lack teeth, the attorney cautions that the mere contemplation of altering the law dredges up intangible costs.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big unknown here. There are opportunity costs with the inhibition to innovate, or the chilling of taking positive, constructive risks with a new business idea, or with a post,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to measure. What technologies or services don\u2019t happen if this law is changed?\u201d  Lawson echoed the point, saying the current crop of platforms are essentially a creation of Congress passing CDA 230. \u201cThis massive growth really probably could not have happened if all of this time all of these websites were having to have armies of lawyers and other people, vetting the content.\u201d  Newer platforms, and not Big Tech, tend to be the entities that test the waters on 230\u2019s reach, Giltrap said. That is because they are more likely to introduce leading-edge technologies that push its boundaries.  Rosenfeld said any changes should be looked at broadly \u2014 not just in terms of what they can do to Big Tech and companies with an in-line presence, but at how those changes will impact people's experiences on the internet.  So far, most alterations to 230 have taken shape through interpretations of the law, by courts, without intervention from lawmakers and administration officials. Still, they do they do shift risk for online platforms. A recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, for example, held that a software company could not use the law as a shield to block content moderation that amounted to anticompetitive behavior.  \u201cThat\u2019s sort of the first gap in the armor,\u201d McDowell said.Alexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

President Donald Trump has (TWTR), putting tech giants in legal and regulatory crosshairs that are likely to outlast the current election cycle.Democrats and Republicans alike voice increasing antipathy over sweeping liability protections that 230 affords to all online platforms \u2014 including (FB), , YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL). All told, experts say it\u2019s becoming clear that change is coming.\u201cIf Trump is reelected, frankly even if he isn\u2019t reelected, you might see variations on this proposal coming into some type of effect next year, with a shocking level of bipartisan support,\u201d Florida\u2019s former consumer protection czar, Richard Lawson, told Yahoo Finance recently. It\u2019s happened before. Back in 2018, bipartisan action on Section 230 created a carve out that removed immunity for user content promoting or facilitating sex trafficking of minors.   \u201cThe fact that they would come together is huge,\u201d Lawson said, speaking of the 2018 change.  In the wake of ongoing efforts by lawmakers and the Trump administration to claw back the protections, some say that\u2019s reason enough for all companies with an online presence to seriously assess the cost of the law\u2019s potential makeover.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of liability at risk,\u201d according to Rob McDowell, a former Federal Communications Commissioner (FCC) under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and partner at Cooley LLP.  \u2018Something\u2019s probably going to happen\u2019Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks during an oversight hearing to examine the Federal Communications Commission on June 24, 2020 in Washington,DC. - The hearing was held by the Senate Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation. (Photo by Alex Wong / POOL / AFP) (Photo by ALEX WONG/POOL/AFP via )The Trump administration has twice targeted Section 230 in the space of a month. The first was a controversial executive order that, in theory, would hand power to the FCC to reinterpret the statute; the second was via legislative \u201creform proposals\u201d published by the Department of Justice (DOJ).Yet independent of what the president may or may not accomplish, Congress is also growing restive, with Democrats and Republicans teaming up on bills to address the law\u2019s perceived shortcomings. In June, Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Thune (R-SD) introduced the \u201cPACT Act,\u201d which would expose platforms to federal civil claims, and allow users to appeal a platform\u2019s moderation actions.Separately, the Senate\u2019s \u201cEARN IT Act\u201d \u2014 introduced by South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham (R-SC), with backing from Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal and other Democrats \u2014 is headed to the full Senate for debate.The measure seeks to remove the liability shield for platforms that fail to meet standards for preventing sexual exploitation of children by the government or platforms. However, security and privacy experts argue the bill\u2019s stated purpose is a backdoor way to rob platforms and their users of encrypted communication.  House Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) has said he\u2019s working on legislation that would impose additional responsibility on companies earning more than $1 billion in annual revenue. In February, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) introduced legislation that would remove liability protections for Big Tech companies that knowingly publish false political advertisements.All of which suggests that the writing appears to be on the wall, according to Cooley\u2019s McDowell \u2014 especially as a mix of political bedfellows join forces.  \u201cIf you have Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Mark Warner, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Sen. Mike Lee, all coming together...something\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d he said.  Change that could be costly Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYNew changes are unlikely before next year. Yet platforms across industries can count on a host of rising compliance costs if user content must be policed more aggressively \u2014 and to defend against ensuing lawsuits.\u201cThe cost of [platforms] actually having to meet the level of granularity that\u2019s expected by some of these regulators -- that\u2019s where the tension lies,\u201d Peter Hyun, a Section 230 expert and partner at Wiley LLP who once served as chief counsel to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).  Legal experts say it\u2019s unclear how big of a war chest companies will need, as it would depend on the nature of a platform\u2019s business, and how significantly any changes shift liability.  While it\u2019s hard to put numbers on it, big platforms \u201ccould potentially be facing millions of dollars in damages costs, depending on what the actual changes to the law are, and they could be spending millions of dollars on increased moderation costs,\u201d according to James Rosenfeld, an attorney who handles defense of 230 claims for major media and tech companies, and previously for Yahoo Finance.  He explained that from a defense perspective, one advantage of 230 is it wipes out the bulk of user-generated, content-based claims in the early stages of litigation.  \u201cSo it cuts your bills a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a single case goes forward, it could be several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars to defend.\u201dAdditional responsibility would require platforms to scale up on content moderation. , for example, pays around that make between $16 and $18 per hour. Collectively, they wade through around 3 million posts per day.Meanwhile, back in 2017, Google announced plans to build out its moderation team with at least 10,000 by 2018. And according to Reuters, \u2019s content moderation arm is comprised of about 1,500 workers.\u2018A monumental shift\u2019Jade Giltrap, head of the media coverage team for cyber insurance provider CFC, explained that even under the current wide-ranging shield, platforms do purchase coverage for claims arising from user-generated content. That includes coverage for defamation, duty of care, intellectual property, and privacy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a defense, not a right,\u201d Giltrap said of the practical application of 230. Accordingly, \u201cthe law\u2019s protection doesn\u2019t kick in from a monetary perspective until a company needs to invoke it as a defense.\u201d  Premiums to defend such claims vary widely, and depend on a platform\u2019s revenue, level of reliance on user-generated content, and lawsuit history. Big Tech platforms that do rely heavily on user generated content, Giltrap said, would tend to face higher premiums. However, they also tend to curb coverage costs through self-insurance and robust in-house legal teams that handle smaller claims, she said.  She added that an errors and omissions policy with a $10 million cap can run well into six figures for a larger online platform, and around $7,500 to $10,000 for small firms. But all that would change under a less comprehensive 230 liability shield.  \u201cWhere these platforms stop becoming only a conduit, and become responsible for most or all of the content on on their platforms, that is a monumental shift, because it doesn't allow for them to adequately control that risk,\u201d Giltrap said. \u201cThey can't control all of their content that moves through their sites.\u201d moderation responsibility is exactly what most proposals to amend 230 have in mind.  Under the DOJ\u2019s proposals, platforms would face civil liability if they purposefully facilitate third party content that violates federal criminal law.  According to Wiley\u2019s Hyun, one problem with that standard is that it tasks platforms with identifying potentially criminal content, as well as guessing what users intended when they posted it. That\u2019s because criminal violations depend on the state of mind of the alleged violator, he said.  A cyberstalking threat posted to social media, for example, could be an obvious threat to the perpetrator who posted it, yet undetectable as such by platform moderators.  Even for experienced prosecutors and investigators, Hyun said that \u201cpainstaking\u201d effort goes into uncovering enough evidence to allege the level of intent required for a single criminal lawsuit to go forward, based on a user\u2019s online speech.  \u201cThat makes it incredibly difficult when you then try to assign that role to a company,\u2019\u201d Hyun said.   The DOJ also wants to permit civil suits against platforms for content-based claims that address a broad array of cyber crimes, and permit government-initiated civil enforcement actions to \u201cprotect citizens from harmful and illicit content.\u201cThe department also aims to remove the phrase \u201cotherwise objectionable\u201d \u2014 something that\u2019s long given platforms liability-free wiggle room to perform \u201cgood faith\u201d content moderation. A redefinition of \u201cgood faith\u201d would mean only moderation that adheres to a platform\u2019s own terms of service.Trump\u2019s Executive OrderThis illustration photo shows a woman in Los Angeles looking at the official account of US President Donald Trump on June 23, 2020, with a tweet by the president which considered \"abusive\" and hid it. - on Tuesday hid a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he threatened to use \"serious force\" against protestors in the US capital, saying it broke rules over abusive content. The move appeared to be the first by against the president for an \"abusive\" tweet. In a growing dispute, the platform has recently labeled other Trump tweets as misleading and violating its standards on promoting violence. (Photo by - / AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via )Trump\u2019s executive order takes a different approach. It looks to hand power to the FCC to reinterpret and issue rules for Section 230, and to the FTC to police content moderation under its authority to enforce unfair and deceptive trade practices.Because 230 extends no authority to either agency, McDowell said efforts to carry out the executive order would probably face legal challenges. On the other hand, the agencies, both independent of the executive branch, could choose to ignore the order altogether.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want the FCC to legislate,\u201d McDowell said. Absent action by the FCC, the FTC could still pursue enforcement action that could prove costly for platforms to defend, even though the agency lacks effective tools for penalizing alleged bad actors, according to McDowell.  Although some proposals to weaken 230 protections may lack teeth, the attorney cautions that the mere contemplation of altering the law dredges up intangible costs.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big unknown here. There are opportunity costs with the inhibition to innovate, or the chilling of taking positive, constructive risks with a new business idea, or with a post,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to measure. What technologies or services don\u2019t happen if this law is changed?\u201d  Lawson echoed the point, saying the current crop of platforms are essentially a creation of Congress passing CDA 230. \u201cThis massive growth really probably could not have happened if all of this time all of these websites were having to have armies of lawyers and other people, vetting the content.\u201d  Newer platforms, and not Big Tech, tend to be the entities that test the waters on 230\u2019s reach, Giltrap said. That is because they are more likely to introduce leading-edge technologies that push its boundaries.  Rosenfeld said any changes should be looked at broadly \u2014 not just in terms of what they can do to Big Tech and companies with an in-line presence, but at how those changes will impact people's experiences on the internet.  So far, most alterations to 230 have taken shape through interpretations of the law, by courts, without intervention from lawmakers and administration officials. Still, they do they do shift risk for online platforms. A recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, for example, held that a software company could not use the law as a shield to block content moderation that amounted to anticompetitive behavior.  \u201cThat\u2019s sort of the first gap in the armor,\u201d McDowell said.Alexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But if Europe lags behind the US in the knowledge economy, and now in the race for artificial intelligence, that is the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cause </emphasis>of its lacking \u201ccompanies of sufficient scale to compete with the Americans\u201d, of its struggling \u201cto nurture a culture of innovation\u201d, and of not producing \u201cenough top-flight computer scientists\u201d; in no way can it be the effect. Companies don\u2019t grow, and people don\u2019t choose, in a vacuum.</p><p>For Mr Stephens, the success of corporate Silicon Valley is due to the personal data being \u201cscooped up without asking permission\u201d, to its indulging \u201cin aggressive tax avoidance\u201d, and to its \u201cblithely ignoring competition rules\u201d. But he fails to mention that the General Data Protection Regulation, issued by Brussels, is increasingly being accepted as the rule by Big Tech companies, which don\u2019t believe it will impede their growth. Furthermore, \u201ctax avoidance\u201d is in reality a tax suspension that was granted to all multinationals as long as they kept their earnings parked in a tax haven (a regime now significantly changed by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://taxfoundation.org/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-explained/\"> Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</url> and the adoption of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://taxfoundation.org/gilti-2019/\"> Global Intangible Low Taxed Income</url>). Nor do acquisitions they made contrast with Robert Bork\u2019s interpretation of American antitrust.</p><p>Above all, Mr Stephens fails to acknowledge that at the end of the last century in Silicon Valley a liberal counterculture tied together values of spontaneous communities and of personal liberty: the free space of the web was where their request for connectedness was met by the offer of connectivity from the industry.</p><p>All these failures reveal a cultural and political attitude that may well be the reason that \u201cEurope is behind\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Franco Debenedetti</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chairman,Istituto Bruno Leoni,Milan, Italy</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-501f0860bdbb11e989e241e555e96722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTF-1PH1-JB77-K37Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

My take is that AT&amp;T is getting slammed in part because the company has lacked a strong marketing messageand because its brand does not resonate especially well with consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last decade, Verizon developed the very successful \u201cCan You Hear Me Now\u201d campaign to establish the perception (matched by fact) of network superiority. Verizon still gets a surprising amount of mileage out of this perceptioneven though the leadership delta has narrowed. And for much of this decade, T-Mobile has set the agenda for the wireless industryby addressing customer pain points with the industry and coming up with creative new ideas, reinforced by its effective \u2018Un-carrier' branding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/elliott-trashes-at-t-management-and-its-execution-wireless\">Elliott trashes AT&amp;T management and its execution in wireless</url></p><p>What about AT&amp;T? On the telecom/wireless side, the company has made a lot of the right movesand is very well positioned for 5G. But the customer perception is that AT&amp;T is still \u2018Big Telco' - itscorporate \u2018death star' logo, plus DTV and Time Warner = 1980s-style corporate conglomerate. And the customer reaction since AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner has been less about what compelling bundles and bennies will accrueand more about concerns that AT&amp;T would ruin their beloved HBO.</p><p>The sad thing is that AT&amp;T doesn't get nearly the credit for the leadership it has demonstrated in numerous areas. AT&amp;T's network has gotten steadily and consistently better since iPhone 3G/early 4G dark days. Its network performance leads in many markets. And, AT&amp;T has the spectrum assets to be in a superior position, network-wise, especially if the T-Mobile/Sprint marriage is not consummated.</p><p>Among the major U.S. carriers, I'd also argue that AT&amp;T is a leader in network innovation. Retiring AT&amp;T exec John Donovan deserves a lot of credit for this, starting with Domain 2.0 and continuing with leadership in virtualization, open networking, project AirGig, and a more open attitude toward partner agreements (i.e. the recent cloud deal with Microsoft). AT&amp;T is also #1 in the enterprise \u2014 a position the company stands to enhance with FirstNet and investments the company has made in IoT. Being a strong player in the enterprise will prove increasingly important in 5G, since that's where the lion's share of the incremental opportunity lies.</p><p>RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-surpasses-750k-firstnet-connections-developing-hpue-assured-wireless\">AT&amp;T surpasses 750K FirstNet connections</url></p><p>But, AT&amp;T doesn't get the love from the media, the trade press, or industry analysts\u2026who still fawn over Verizon or hope to get invited by John Legere to the next rock concert. AT&amp;T still suffers from a perception that its network is not up to snuff (not matched by reality). DirecTV might have brought AT&amp;T lots of cash flow, content relationships, and the subscribers it could use to pioneer an innovative ad strategy, but it has not delivered much in the way of synergies or enhancement to the brand. Let's face it -- other than some periodic incentive programs, very few customers have switched to AT&amp;T because of DTV. And, I'd argue that DTV has perpetuated AT&amp;T's \u2018Big Telco' image by being in a business that is dying a slow death in the cord-cutting era. Service blackouts due to rights fees disputes haven't helped, either.</p><p>Then there's DirecTV Now (recently renamed AT&amp;T TV Now, yuck), which went from being mediocre at launch to being OK now, which won't cut it in an increasingly crowded field. And speaking of crowded fields, even the timing of the Time Warner acquisition was somewhat unfortunate. It now appears that AT&amp;T's streaming service, HBO Max, won't launch until 2020, giving Disney Plus and Apple TV+ a several month lead. Disney Plus is going to be a pretty compelling proposition, with brand+content+$6.99 a month. A no-brainer for many. It's hard to see where AT&amp;T is going to find a lot of daylight in this space.</p><p>RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/deeper-dive-at-t-tv-falls-short-radically-reshaping-concept-television\">Deeper Dive\u2014AT&amp;T TV falls short of \u2018radically reshaping' the concept of television</url></p><p>AT&amp;T could do a lot more to help its brand, in two ways. First, it needs to do a better job trumpeting its assets, leadership, and innovation. Second, AT&amp;T must develop some bold ideas that leverage its combined assets, and build a more compelling marketing narrative to help sell the story. Some ideas:</p><p>\u2022 Stronger message around the network. Move away from \u2018Fake News 5G (5GE)' and \u2018Faux 5G+ Launches' (where nobody can actually buy the service). Instead, plant the seeds that the company is in a great position, long-term, to be a best-in-class wireless network, given its collection of assets (spectrum) and innovation (open networking, etc).</p><p>\u2022 Reinforce its leadership position in the enterprise. AT&amp;T has long had the #1 position in the enterprise. With its assets in IoT, FirstNet, recent cloud deals, spectrum position, stumbles by Verizon, and delays in the T-Mobile/Sprint deal, the enterprise is an area with significant incremental revenue potential. AT&amp;T has an opportunity to build its lead here. </p><p>\u2022 Assuage worries about HBO and do something innovative. AT&amp;T has failed to communicate to its 150 million worldwide HBO subscribers that it is investing even more in premium content, as Netflix continues to head in a Walmart (OK, Target) direction. Instead, consumers read about HBO's exec team being guttedand are worried sick that AT&amp;T will abrade HBO's quality in the name of quantity.</p><p>But there's also a huge upside opportunity. HBO is among the best-loved brands in a fiercely competitive business. AT&amp;T should reinforce that HBO will remain a brand associated with premium content. And in a crowded field, good content and product differentiation will win.</p><p>Then, why not bundle HBO Max as part of a new AT&amp;T customer loyalty program, a la Amazon Prime? For example, any family with three or more AT&amp;T Wireless subscribers, or customers who have been with AT&amp;T for X years. Borrowing from the telco playbook, churn reduction is as important as subscriber additions. In an era where wireless and broadband services are increasingly commoditized, give customers a reason to stay with AT&amp;T.</p><p>\u2022 Turn Xandr from liability to opportunity. AT&amp;T is in a precarious position with its plans for targeted advertising. Big Tech's missteps of late have handicapped any company's attempts to muck around with customer data, no less a telecom company. Add to that the greater regulatory scrutiny telcos get compared to Internet companies (sad fact), and AT&amp;T is not starting from a position of advantage here.</p><p>But as the relative new kid on the targeted advertising block, AT&amp;T has an opportunity to get it right. Start by changing the name \u2013 right now it sounds like a Pharma product. Then be really, really transparent to consumers about its plans for targeted ads showingthat this can be a positive for consumers, rather than something creepy, or worse. Maybe even have them participate in the process \u2013 i.e. \u2018here's an hour of content with typical ads, and here's that same hour with targeted ads, what's your feedback'?</p><p>The folks at Elliott Management (and others that will now surely come out of the woodwork) will look at AT&amp;T through a financial and shareholder lens, as well they should. But it would help if they saw that AT&amp;T, with its collection of assets, as a story that customers are buying into. As AT&amp;T continues to shuffle its management team and corporate structure, the company should bolster its senior marketing leadership team, in part by recruiting some fresh new talent from outside the industry.</p><p>Job number one would be to develop a better story about how AT&amp;T's collection of assets position the company well for the next ten years, and to then build some greater brand equity around that message. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:mlowenstein@m-ecosystem.com\">Mark Lowenstein</url>, a leading industry analyst, consultant, and commentator, is managing director of      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m-ecosystem.com/\">Mobile Ecosystem</url>.

Barr blasted Big Tech on Wednesday, raising the specter that Silicon Valley might soon be held accountable for a wide array of dangerous, harmful content that critics say has flourished on their sites and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At an event that laid bare tech's broad troubles - including the spread of terrorism, illicit drug sales and child sexual exploitation online - Barr said it may be time for the government to seek sweeping changes to a key portion of federal law, known as Section 230, that long has spared tech companies from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Barr said in a speech, reflecting on the origin of the statute. \"They have become titans.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barr's comments came during a day-long summit focused on the law, which aimed to study whether the decades-old federal safeguards that helped incubate the Internet have become hindrances, preventing law enforcement and aggrieved users from obtaining justice when people are harmed.</p><p>But the volatility of the debate flared repeatedly during a second, private gathering later in the day with top officials, tech giants and other digital experts.</p><p>In raising a series of issues around Section 230, DOJ officials at one point asked if social media platforms should be held liable for decisions they make around political speech, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who requested anonymity because it was supposed to be off-the-record. That sparked into a heated debate among participants over allegations that social-media companies are biased against conservatives, a charge repeated by President Trump - yet one that Facebook, Google and other companies deny.</p><p>A Justice Department aide, taking no position on the issue, initially described the fight over political speech as the \"800-pound elephant in the room,\" the sources said. Those leveling the charges of censorship, according to the sources, included a participant from the Media Research Center's TechWatch initiative, which asserts on its web page that \"a handful of tech companies can censor both the people and the ideals of the right.\"</p><p>DOJ declined to comment. A spokesman for Media Research Center did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Justice Department has been exploring Section 230 as part of a wide-ranging probe of Facebook, Google and other companies, an inquiry that's also studied whether those firms have become too big, powerful and anti-competitive. Justice officials have signaled they plan to put forward recommendations - and potentially bring individual cases against companies - before the end of the year.</p><p>For regulators, their concern is that Facebook, Google and other tech giants -- despite connecting once disparate communities -- have served as conduits for harm and abuse. They've unwittingly housed hate speech and extremism, and helped spread graphic, viral videos of violent acts, including the deadly attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year. They've become marketplaces for the sale or promotion of guns, drugs and fake medical cures. And they've been weaponized to spread misinformation and undermine elections, including in the United States. Often, they're able to dodge direct punishment even when their technologies are used to enhance the reach of such harmful material, critics say.</p><p>Lobbyists from Facebook, Google and other online platforms have fought vigorously in response to protect their prized legal shield, arguing it actually gives them cover to do the sort of content moderation that governments seek - without being sued for the decisions they make about the posts they leave up or take down.</p><p>\"Certainly, more can be done,\" Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, said in a public panel discussion. The group represents Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies. \"I don't think we should assume the misconduct of a few bad actors is generalizable across a large industry.\"</p><p>But Barr -- who cautioned earlier Wednesday he had not come to a final position on whether Section 230 should be significantly revised or repealed - still highlighted the law's \"expansive reach,\" a comment that could encourage members of Congress who have floated similar suggestions about changes to the law.</p><p>Amid withering criticism, many in the industry have emphasized their recent work to improve their policies, hire more people to review content and take swifter, more aggressive action to ensure users aren't harmed. Yet their assurances have failed to assuage regulators even beyond Washington: Throughout the European Union, for example, policymakers have contemplated a raft of fines and other punishments in the event Facebook, Google and their peers fail to prevent or disable dangerous posts, photos and videos in real time.</p><p>The regulatory threat has grown so dire that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg paid a rare visit to Brussels on Monday. Ahead of his visit with E.U. officials, the social-networking giant articulated its position on regulation, arguing in a white paper that laws that \"punish the publication of illegal speech are unsuitable for the internet landscape.\"</p><p>But the idea appeared to find an icy reception among the European Commission, where some members have pushed the company to play a more active, aggressive role in policing the Web for harm. \"Facebook cannot push away all the responsibility,\" Vera Jourova, the E.U. vice president for values and transparency, told reporters.</p><p>In Washington, top officials on Wednesday sought to make their own case about the need for Facebook, Google and their peers - with vast reach and once unfathomable profits - to be held more accountable for their role in facilitating the spread of dangerous posts, photos and videos.</p><p>\"We're constantly reminded that the same technology that facilitates free speech, connects with our loved ones and our friends and enriches our lives can pose serious dangers,\" FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said to open an event on Section 230.</p><p>The full scope of DOJ's interests surfaced at its private gathering with top officials, tech giants and other digital experts late Wednesday. DOJ officials raised a series of potential tweaks to the law, describing their attempts to solicit feedback as a \"launch point\" for future reform, according to four people familiar with the gathering.</p><p>DOJ officials did not endorse any specific reform to Section 230. But one of the ideas top aides proposed for discussion essentially would require Facebook, Google and other tech giants to take certain steps in order to earn protection under Section 230 from lawsuits and other punishments, three people familiar with the meeting said. The idea tracks with ideas expected soon in a draft bill led by GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), the sources said.</p><p>Speaking Wednesday in a public setting, Carrie Goldberg, an attorney who specializes in sexual privacy violations, offered one example of the potential harm from her own case work: A plaintiff whose ex repeatedly created fake profiles of him on Grindr, a gay dating app, putting him at risk for assault.</p><p>The ex would \"post my client's geographic information, and then send people\" to his home and workplace, looking for sex, Goldberg said. The plaintiff repeatedly flagged the issue to Grindr, to no avail, and a subsequent lawsuit fell short of holding the company accountable in court. Grindr prevailed by invoking Section 230, she said.</p><p>\"They see Section 230, and all the case law over the past few decades ... as a pass,\" Goldberg continued, \"and take no action whatsoever.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a293901a3d1548d79a3537ace67333dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7T-36N1-DXKP-J0WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1268\"/><timeReceived>2:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

BARR </p><p>[*]BARR: Thank you very much, Andrew, for your kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan are--are doing here for the people of Michigan, and all the law enforcement community from Michigan that is here today. We really appreciate your work. </p><p>And as Andrew said, after my remarks, they're going to put on a presentation on the China initiative which I think you'd find very interesting. So if you have the time, I--I'd urge you to--to stay for that. And I'd like to thank the--the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, especially Elaine Didier for hosting this event. And also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its executive director, Joe Calvaruso. </p><p>Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances, it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come--I know many have come from--from around the state and I appreciate the--the effort that was made to--to be here for these remarks. I was last in Grand Rapids, it--it'd be 30 years ago, John. John Smietanka from here was one of my principal deputies when I was deputy attorney general and stayed on while I was attorney general. He was the U.S. attorney here in the western district so, John, it's great to see you here. </p><p>I feel a special bond to the Ford administration so it's appropriate to--to be here today for these remarks because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and then President Ford took office. And because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my--were my mentors. </p><p>One of the people I met was the attorney general at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford had made attorney general and his portrait is up in my conference room. And his grandson, Will Levi, is my chief of staff so, as I say, I feel especially close to the--to the Ford administration. I wasn't a political appointee in that administration, many of the political appointees I've worked with over the years who really cut their--cut their teeth during the Ford administration. </p><p>I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the 21st century and that is the United States' response in the global ambitions--to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. </p><p>How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue to--will control the future. You know since the 1890s at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. </p><p>It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history by turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen, which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren? </p><p>Several weeks ago the national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that the days of American passivity and nai--naivete regarding the People's Republic of China are over. And last week the FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and maligned influence activities. </p><p>In the coming days you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now Chris Wray told me that shortly after his speech last week one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim today to be despicable. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no--no matter how they (PH) Chinese seek to characterize it, I do hope that my speech and--and Mike Pompeo's speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>It is fitting that we're here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest ech--echelons of--of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972. And three years' later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near peer competitor of the United States. And even then there were signs of China's immense latent power. </p><p>In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-minority leader Gerald Ford, wrote, \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people. This last impression of the reality of China's colossal potential is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\" </p><p>It is now nearly 50 years later, and the (INAUDIBLE) ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto hide your strength, bide your time. That is precisely what China has done. </p><p>China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today and by some estimates based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of (INAUDIBLE) now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. </p><p>China is no longer hiding its strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived. The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg an aggressive orchestrated whole of government indeed whole of society campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is (AUDIO GAP) such as robotics and telecommunications. </p><p>It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies but to replace them altogether. Made in China 2025 is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisition, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyber-attacks, and industrial espionage. </p><p>About 80 percent of all federal economic espionage prosecutions allege conduct undertaken for the benefit of the Chinese state, and about 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China. The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea for example through which about one-third on the world's maritime trade passes the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands, and placed military outpost on them and harassed its neighbors, ships and fishing boats. </p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's Belt and Roads infrastructure initiative. Although billed as foreign aid, in fact, these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interest and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading port companies up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms and then taking control of the infrastructure itself as it did with Sri Lanka--with its Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. </p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its digital Silk Road initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States and other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovation such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill much like chess or even more complex Chinese game of Go. </p><p>In 2017, Beijing unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence plan, a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential but a range of military applications such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence. The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. </p><p>According to the Congressional research service from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China in large part due to the lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation. The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall China is America's top supplier accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risk of dependence are real. </p><p>In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving the disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For 100 years, America's was the world's largest manufacturing allowing us to serve the world's--serve as the world's arsenal of democracy. China overtook the United States and manufacturing output in 2010; the PRC is now be world's arsenal of dictatorship. How did China accomplish all of this? </p><p>No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980 Congress granted the PRC most favored nation trading status. In the 1990s, American company strongly supported the PRC succession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today U.S. China trade totals about $700 billion. </p><p>Last year Newsweek ran a cover story titled How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again. The article details tell China's communist leaders Lord American business with the promise of market access and then having profited from American investment, and know-how turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms using tactics like holding up permits, yet few companies even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring formal trade complaints for fear of angering Beijing. </p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on Chinese markets, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as facemasks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers, including American companies, from exporting them to other countries that needed them. </p><p>It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and then requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments. China's dominance of the world's markets for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices while at the same time discriminate--discriminating against American medical companies in China. </p><p>China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products Made in China and pressured American firms to build factories in China where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American Medical device manufacturers are effectively creating their own competitors. America has also--also depends on Chinese supply--Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients known as APIs. As one defense health agency official noted, should China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs on the United States, it could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses. </p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook that they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a high value added industry and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms well-known obstacles in the Chinese health market include drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. </p><p>Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and health care companies. In fact, PRC linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal the IP related to coronavirus treatment and vaccines. Sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs. </p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States, it is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, the belief by foreign companies that large financial investments and sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice. </p><p>Although Americans hope that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law or an independent judiciary. </p><p>The CPP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employees an army of government censors, tortures dissidents and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrinate indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America's changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. </p><p>As this administration's China strategy recognizes, the CPC's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders. Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world including on American soil. All too often for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence, even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. </p><p>Sadly, examples of American business bowing to China art Legion. Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. </p><p>This censorship infects not only the versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in the United States theaters to American audiences. For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized. </p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Doctor Strange, film makers changed the nationality of the major character known as the Ancient One, a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it to from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he is Tibetan, you risk alienating 1 billion people. Or, as the Chinese government might say, we are not going to show your movie because you decided to get political. </p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered one way or another to please the CCP. National Security Adviser O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day because writers and producers know not to test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. That CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market both through quotas on American films imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. </p><p>In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of the U.S. box-office ticket sales compared to only 3 percent five years earlier. But in the long run, as with other Chinese industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown--homegrown movie productions. </p><p>To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, everything we've learned, we've learned from Hollywood. Notably in 2018--'19, 8 of the 10 top grossing films in China were produced in China. </p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000 when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which Liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem. Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Chinese communists build the great firewall of China, the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship. Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its App Store in China after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of Hong Kong democracy protests. </p><p>Apple also removed the apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the great firewall and illuminated pro-democracy songs from the Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that that move would give that Communist Party easier access to emails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud. </p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. And during the gunfight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones. And we thought that suggested that there might be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months, we tried to get in without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into those cell phones. </p><p>We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future where we found communications with al Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. </p><p>And what we've asked for is warrant--when we have a warrant from a court then we should be able to get into those cell phones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies. </p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market--market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind the scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives. Efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. </p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same. The businessperson has economic interest in China and there is a suggestion that things will go better or worse for them depending on their response to PRC's requests. </p><p>Privately pressuring and courting American corporate leaders to promote policies or you as politicians presents a significant threat because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a friendly face on its pro regime policies. The legislator or the policy maker who hears from these American businessmen is probably more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result if its lobbying are exposed. </p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of a--of Guanxi, a system of influence--influential social networking necessary to do business in the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. </p><p>FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct, but it does require those who are acting as agents of foreign principals to publicly in disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility. By focusing on American business leaders, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations, but they are principled targets today of Chinese influence operations in the United States. </p><p>The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, sensor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government funded Confucian institutes, which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other, refused to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices, support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds, and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of a appeasing the CCP's demands. </p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens rather than as American institutions, but they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, that rule of law, and the security of afforded by America's economic technological and military strength. Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. </p><p>A world marching to the beat of the communist China's--Chinese drum will not be hospitable be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time when American companies understood that they saw them--understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values. </p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company Disney made dozens of public information films about for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over at 90 percent of Disney's employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, at Disney also designed Insignia that appeared in planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American allied forces. </p><p>I suspect that Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with foreign dictatorships today. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it, ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last. </p><p>After that CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access and the CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a stupid mistake. Disney then Began courting the PRC to open a 5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give the Chinese government officials role in its management. Of the parks full time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party and they reportedly display hammer and sickle insignia on their desks and attend party lectures at the facility during business hours. </p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese owned theme park popped up a couple 100 miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. Americas--American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, but we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. </p><p>But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future, competitiveness, and prosperity as well as that classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive. During the Cold War, Lewis Powell, later Justice Powell sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. </p><p>The time has come, he said, indeed it is long overdue for the wisdom, ingenuity, and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it. So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods and they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. </p><p>If individual companies are afraid to take a stand, there is strength in numbers. As a Justice Powell wrote, strength lies in organization and careful long range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint efforts and in the political power available only through united action and national organization. </p><p>Despite years of acquiescence in communist authorities in China, America's tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with government requests for user data. </p><p>True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for non-compliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they hold firm. We hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. </p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and our grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of a whole of society approach in which the public and private sectors maintain their separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. </p><p>America has done that before and if we rekindle our love and devotion of our country and each other, I am confident that we, the American people, the American government and American business together can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. Thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CF-KYG1-F15W-H384-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

BARR </p><p>[*](APPLAUSE) </p><p>BAKER: Thank you very much, indeed, John for that introduction. Thank you, General Barr, for being here. Welcome. </p><p>BARR: Thanks. </p><p>BAKER: The headline for this-- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>--and with your indulgence, there's quite a lot of news, as John said, at the moment. So I'm going to start with the other matters part of the-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARR: Sure, that would be (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BAKER: --the other matters part of the program. So you may--it may possibly have captured your attention this morning that the House of Representatives published two articles of impeachment against the president of the United States. Let me just read out  an excerpt from the first article of impeachment, which says that using the pow--using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. He solicited the government of Ukraine to announce investigations that would, among other things, harm the election prospects of a political opponent. Is that not exactly the sort of abuse of power that the founders had in mind when they drew up the impeachment clause of the Constitution? </p><p>BARR: You put so much work into that question. I feel-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--I feel bad that I'm going to give you the answer (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BAKER: I had all morning, after all. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARR: Which is, you know, there's this political constitutional process underway on the Hill, and the attorney general is not part of that process, and at this stage I'm just not going to comment on it. </p><p>BAKER: Nothing at all? </p><p>BARR: I will say--I will say that on the other article of impeachment relating to obstruction, I don't believe it's the case that where somebody, including a branch of government, is asserting a legal privilege that they have under the law, that that constitutes obstruction. </p><p>BAKER: The second article says President Trump directed the unprecedented categorical and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives and under--given that the Constitution gives the House sole responsibility for impeachment, this is itself a--represents obstruction. </p><p>BARR: As I said, I just said what I said, which is it was predicated on advancing claims of privilege that have been previously advanced in other administrations, and I don't consider that obstruction. </p><p>BAKER: So it is not unprecedented? </p><p>BARR: No. </p><p>BAKER: Let's move on to the other issue that was occupying a lot of your attention yesterday, which was the publication of the report of the Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz into the origins of the--and the conduct of the investigation of President Trump and his associates around the Russia allegations about collusion with Russia. </p><p>Mr. Horowitz in his report said yesterday, we concluded that the FBI had an authorized purpose when it opened Crossfire Hurricane--that was the name of the--given to the investigation--to obtain information about or protect against a national security threat or federal crime. You said in response to that yesterday, the FBI launched an intrusive investigation on the thinnest of suspicions that were in my view insufficient to justify the steps taken. Could you tell us what exactly it is--where exactly you disagree with Mr. Horowitz? </p><p>BARR: Okay. Well, first let me say I think there are sort of three parts or issues--well, let's say categories of--of analysis in the report. The first is was the investigation adequately predicated, start of it? The second one is how was it conducted? And I break that down into two things, how was it conducted before the election and how was it conducted after the election? The real meat of Horowitz's work and the real thrust of the report actually deals with the conduct of the investigation, where I think it quickly became apparent that it was a travesty. And there were many abuses. And that's by far the most important part of the report. I think Mike Horowitz would agree with that. </p><p>BAKER: The abuses, these--I want to come onto these in detail, but abuses that in particular refer to the FISA application--the application to the FI--for the-- </p><p>BARR: And also the--and also the fact that from day one it generated exculpatory information and nothing that substantiated any kind of collusion. But that aside from it and going back to the issue, in many ways sort of the issue of whether it technically was adequately predicated is something of academic interest only, but where I disagree--and by the way, Mike knows I disagree with him, and there are still people in this town where you can have--where, you know, you can be adults and professionals and have disagreement without tearing each other's hearts out. So it's just one of those things. We have disagreements in the Department of Justice. </p><p>But I think that the basic--it's a big deal to use the law enforcement and the intelligence resources of the United States government to investigate a campaign of, especially an opposing party. I can't think of an--I'm sure there were instances in the past, but I can't think of any recent instance where that was done. </p><p>BAKER: The report does make clear there were concerns about that and discussions at very high levels within the FBI as to the sensitive information, sensitive (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARR: And so, you know, basically the department, as you would expect, the principles are essentially rule of reason. What is the basis you have for looking into something, and, you know, what are reasonable steps to take? Taking into consideration the weight of the evidence that's prompting you to do that, the alternatives available and exactly what you are trying to accomplish and also the sensitivity of the area involved here, a political campaign, core First Amendment activity. And where I disagree with Mike is I just think this was very flimsy. This was a comment made by a 28-year-old volunteer in a campaign in a bar, offhand, which was described as a suggestion of a suggestion. </p><p>BAKER: Right. </p><p>BARR: And I personally think the subject matter of it, which was the fact, you know, some vague allusion to the fact that the Russians may have something that they could dump. At that time, in May 2016, there was rampant speculation going on in the media on the blogosphere and in political circles that Hillary Clinton's email server had in 2014 been hacked and therefore the Russians might have those emails. So drawing the conclusion that this kind of vague comment related to and showed pre-knowledge of the DNC hack and dump, I think was a big stretch. But let me just finalize it, which is from my experience the normal thing to do in this kind of situation--and I have had analogous experience here--is to go--to go to the--to go to the campaign, and here I don't think there is a legitimate explanation for why they didn't, especially because they went to the Russians. </p><p>BAKER: Well I think actually in the report I think it does say that, you know, they considered this, but there were concerns that because the campaign--they would be alerting the campaign if there was criminal activity going on they would be alerting the campaign and they would be able to shut it down. </p><p>BARR: Right, and what the FBI person said as to why he didn't is he said we only do that if we're--if we are certain, if there is no possibility whatever that the person is witting of their--and that's simply not true. I mean, I have authorized defensive briefings, and I know of defensive briefings that are regularly conducted. You look at all the circumstances. If your purpose was to protect the election, then you would've done a defensive briefing here because the chances of people like Sessions or Chris Christie being in cahoots with the Russians were pretty minimal, but if there was stuff going on, then by going in you brace them and you disrupt the activity in time to protect the election. </p><p>But it just doesn't hold water because on August 4 they contacted the head of Russia intelligence and said we know what you're up to; you better stop it. They did again in later August, and President Obama did it directly in September. So it doesn't strike me as plausible that you would tell the Russians who clearly were guilty of interference, but you wouldn't--wouldn't go and talk to the campaign. That makes no sense. </p><p>BAKER: So you believe the predicate was very, very flimsy. </p><p>BARR: Yeah. </p><p>BAKER: Essentially, you've just laid that out. So why did they do it? Do you think there was some political motivation on the part of people at the FBI to--or the Justice Department to the FBI at the time to go off of the Trump campaign this way? </p><p>BARR: That's why we have Durham. I mean, Durham--Durham, you know, was able to look at all the evidence. He's able to not only look at the evidence within the FBI, he's able to require people to testify. He's-- </p><p>BAKER: This is the U.S. attorney (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BARR: U.S. attorney, and--and he's able to talk to other agencies, he is able to talk to private parties. There is a lot of swirling activity going on at this time, it wasn't all in the FBI, so I think he will have a broader appreciation of all of the facts and a determination can be made. I don't know what the motivations were, and I am not--I am not saying they were improper motivations but I--I think it is premature to you know rule definitively there wasn't. Now in that regard, people have to understand the role of the IG. You know we are an agency that makes discretionary decisions every day, thousands of them and the internal watchdog, his general approach and it is the right approach and I respect it is--is to say look, if the people involved give me reasonable explanations for what they do that is there--their explanation is not unreasonable on their face and I can't find in the documentary or testimonial evidence that contradicts it I will accept it and that is what happened here. </p><p>He said I haven't found evidence of improper motive. He did not--contrary to what a lot of media is reporting he did not find there was no improper motive, he didn't find evidence of improper motive. </p><p>BAKER: The evidence of absence of evidence is not (INAUDIBLE). So Christopher Wray, the FBI director similarly said yesterday in response to the report the--the report did not find, we did not find believable bias or improper motivation. Again do--do you challenge that? </p><p>BARR: No, I am just saying what--what the IG found, the IG said I didn't--I didn't--did not find documentary or testimonial evidence contradicting the reason or the explanations that were given to me and I excepted them. He--he is not definitively ruling that there was no bias. I think that is why we have Durham. </p><p>BAKER: The initial investigation the FBI again in the report it says the FBI saw that and (INAUDIBLE) refer to that initial conversation between George Papadopoulos and Alexander Downer it is just referred to in the report as--I love these acronyms, FFG, friendly foreign government. </p><p>BARR: Friendly foreign government (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BAKER: FFG. </p><p>BARR: We never heard (INAUDIBLE) or not. </p><p>BAKER: We also have CHS, confidential human sources and various others but--but there was this conversation between Papadopoulos and the Australian which probably wasn't reported actually for about two months I think after the initial--after the initial conversation but the FBI regarded that as a tipping point given what had been seen about the WikiLeaks publication, what it knew about the DNC hack already and that this some--is it not reasonable that they thought given that they knew there was this extensive Russian effort to intervene in the election along comes somebody inside the Trump campaign who says you know what we've got this information and possibly I have been offered--I have been offered information possibly dirt on Hillary Clinton is that not reasonable then for the FBI to go ahead and say you know what we probably need to investigate this? </p><p>BARR: That is why I sort of expanded on this say little bit in the front and. The basic official version is that we thought the Russians were hacking into the DNC, and on July 23, WikiLeaks dumped DNC emails. Then a foreign official comes in and says you know, back in May this guy said something in and it bothered me, it was a suggestion than a suggestion and before they even interviewed that person they--the open the counterintelligence investigation on the whole campaign on the idea that this must reflect pre-knowledge of the hack. </p><p>I am saying that when you actually look at the surrounding circumstances, that was--that was a bridge too far. I mean there--it wasn't reasonable for them to assume that and the proper response was to talk to the campaign. That is normally where it would happen. You know this happens all of the time in campaigns. You know distraught foreign donors, through scrub donors and there is hanky-panky going on and usually, we don't assume it is the government that the campaign is part of that plot. We go and we say to the campaign hey, there's foreign people that are feeding money into your campaign and so forth. So the idea that you only talk to the--some of Americans involved here if you are 100 percent certain that they are not culpable is simply not true. </p><p>BAKER: Just very quickly on this because we do want to move on to other things, but on the FISA application, particularly again, the report is very critical. Documents 17 omissions or errors in the--on the initial or the three subsequent applications to the FISA court for surveillance of (INAUDIBLE) as we know that the report does say it resulted in FISA applications that made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case. Do you think that, given that that actually those FISA applications should never have been made? </p><p>BARR: Yes, the--this is the meat of the issue, and if you actually spend time to look what happened, I think you would be appalled. Remember they say okay, we are not going to go and talk to the campaign. We are going to send people in and wire them up and have them talk to the individuals. That happened. That happened in August, September and October, and it all came back exculpatory people saying I don't know--don't know what you are talking about. Not only exculpatory as to the relationship with the Russians but as to the specific facts and that day they never did anything about that. They just pressed ahead but be, they never informed the court. They were told they didn't have probable cause to get a warrant and so they took the steel dossier, which they had done nothing to verify, and they use that to get the warrant, collapse everything. They--they withheld from the court all of the exculpatory information and they withheld from the court information about the lack of reliability of Steele. </p><p>The real interesting thing here, to me the major take go away actually is after the election because in January they went to--Steele was dealing with one person, only talk to one person, and that is the--what we call the primary sub source and it was that person who have the so-called network of sub-sources. When they finally got around to talking to him he said I don't know what Steele is talking about, I didn't tell him this stuff or you know it was mostly barroom talk and rumor. I made it clear to him this was my own suppositions and theories and you know this--and at that point, it was clear that the dossier was a sham. So what happens? What happens at that point? They don't tell the court and they continue to get FISA warrants based on that dossier and more damning is that they actually filed with a court a statement saying we talked to the sub source and we found him credible and cooperative and they put that into bolster-- </p><p>BAKER: When the sub source (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BARR: What he was being truthful about is that the dossier was garbage. So it is hard to look at this stuff. I think that it was a gross abuse. </p><p>BAKER: Let me put it another way. Do you think the judges, the four separate FISA judges in those courts were badly misled? </p><p>BARR: Yes. </p><p>BAKER: Just final question on this. The report also says this was a failure not only of the operational team in the FBI but if the managers and supervisors including senior officials in the chain of command there's going to--there's going--are people going to be held accountable? </p><p>BARR: Well, they are all gone. </p><p>BAKER: Do they need to be held? Is there some--you have mentioned--you have mentioned obviously the other investigations going on? </p><p>BARR: You know, I think that's--that's-- </p><p>BAKER: Is that up to and including Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe? </p><p>BARR: I am not going to speculate who but </p><p>BAKER: Do you think they--do you think they are implicated in that statement? </p><p>BARR: I think I have said that I think that group there was a failure of leadership, and I will just quote the IG, and the IG says that the explanations he received were not satisfactory. When you have the kind of rank behavior that man involved and the IG says he doesn't get an explanation for it you can draw your own conclusions from that but here--here I want to say one of the things that is poisonous about our politics is the use of the criminal law process as a political weapon and both sides to some extent are guilty of this and instead of just invading ideas may want to label their adversary as a criminal and they you know for over the U.S. code to try to find some kind of esoteric argument as to why won't when someone does there is a crime, and you get into criminal investigation. And then they start calling for scouts. So you know nowadays I am constantly hit why aren't people going to prison for what they did to the president. On the other side, you know throw Bill Barr in prison and these things take time. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You know at the end of the day we are all protected by the fact and this is something I will get to if you want to talk about white-collar crime-- </p><p>BAKER: Yes, I do. </p><p>BARR: Which is-- </p><p>BAKER: (INAUDIBLE) nothing but white-collar crime I think you were talking about a different (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BARR: What protects all of us is that the government has to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt at least under Justice Department standards before we indict anybody and that is a pretty substantial hurdle, and no one is going to go to jail and no one is going to be indicted unless that standard is men and I know a lot of people (INAUDIBLE) they think if I don't like someone and I don't like what they did and I am morally outraged send them to jail and why isn't this person being indicted and that is you know sort of poisoning the system. And that's you know, sort of poisoning the system. </p><p>BAKER: Very quick question before you get onto that address. On--on the Ukraine issue--famous July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky which is the cause of this impeachment proceeding that we are seeing today. There is--there is a quote in there where he says there is a lot of--President Trump says to President Zelensky there is a lot of talk about Biden's son. That Biden stopped the prosecution that was of the--of the Ukrainian prosecutor and a lot of people want to find out about that. So, whatever you can do with the Attorney General that would be great. It seems horrible to me. </p><p>Did the Ukrainians do anything with you? </p><p>BARR: No. </p><p>BAKER: Nothing at all? </p><p>BARR: No. That is taken out of context just to be fair. I mean, in the president's call he started out by talking about the abuses in the 2016 election that he said our country has paid a heavy price for and he asked them to work with the Attorney General on that. </p><p>Now, the fact is I was smart enough not to get involved with Ukraine. At least put it very low on the list. </p><p>BAKER: You can trust yourself--trust yourself with Rudy Giuliani you are saying? </p><p>BARR: I am saying that you know, that hadn't reached the top of my to do list yet and so fortunately I hadn't you know, looked into the Ukraine situation. But he then later in the conversation gets into other things and then he starts throwing different names around. </p><p>But the fact, as I said at the time I had no dealings with Ukraine. I had no dealings with Rudy Giuliani about Ukraine. </p><p>BAKER: Just raise the question, why was this never a U.S. investigation? The allegation was that a U.S. citizen was perhaps corruptly acting you know with a--with a Ukrainian--why was all the pressure on the Ukrainians to announce an investigation? Why was--why would then--why would that not be a matter for U.S. investigatorial authorities? </p><p>BARR: You know, I at the time I--I don't know whether it was or not frankly. </p><p>BAKER: Antitrust. The--it has been widely reported. I know you can't talk about it the Justice Department the antitrust division is investigating big tech--technology--technology firms I know you had a strong interest in this--in this over the years. But in the private sector now in your role big investigation meanwhile the FTC is also--also investigation. </p><p>There seems to be (INAUDIBLE) supporting Washington to do something about what is seen as the dominating position of big tech again, I don't even want to talk about the details. But first can I just ask you the timing on that investigation? Are you, it was announced over the summer are you expecting any kind of eminent resolution? Can we expect it sometime next year? </p><p>BARR: You know, I don't want to sort of predict that. I started it in Ju--we started in earnest in July. It has been moving very quickly. We have a very--ambitious schedule and things are--are keeping up to schedule. We are talking very broadly with people, getting a lot of input from people int eh industry and experts and so forth and we are doing our analysis. And, you know, I would like to have it completed sometime next year. </p><p>I think it's important to move quickly on things. That is something we can talk about later. You know, these things have cost to the marketplace and to the businesses. And I think at some point the government has to fish or cut bait. </p><p>BAKER: What are the principals here at stake? I mean obviously, bigness alone is not these are enormous companies. They dominate sectors. They dominate the U.S. economy and the markets in this way. But it is well established that scale alone is not sufficient to warrant antitrust enforcement action or even to raise necessarily concerns about--about--about unfair behavior. </p><p>So what--what--what would be the pr--without getting into it again, what are the concerns about what Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, maybe others are doing? </p><p>BARR: Let me just say you know, our--our review is not just limited to antitrust. Antitrust obviously is front and center but there are also other concerns relating to these companies. Other laws might apply to. There is some pressure or some people have suggested sort of strong arming the antitrust laws in order to reach things that really were not intended to be covered by the antitrust laws. And I am not really in line with that. I don't mind updating making sure that we are properly applying the antitrust laws to new situations. </p><p>But we are looking at antitrust. We are also looking at behavior across the board and how it implicates other laws. The problem obviously, and I said this in my confirmation hearing you know, big is not bad. I work for Verizon and I really appreciate that. But the question is when you have the kind of market power that some companies have in their--in their market then some conduct which you may--which may have made sense when they were sort of the insurgent company in a growing industry can become anticompetitive because it ends up fortifying the monopoly. </p><p>So, there is conduct that has grown up in these businesses that we have to take a look at and see the extent to which it really involves maintaining a--maintaining a monopoly. Also, this is particularly true where you have a powerful network effects like you do in these sectors. The other thing is that these are businesses that operate in multiple submarkets and you have to do a lot of thinking about how--how they potentially are leveraging power one and to another and also the role that data plays in that. </p><p>BAKER: Couple--couple of the issues again. You got you may or may not want to comment on it. But couple of things that people have raised concerns about are things like, for example, bias in search results. That they could be the algorithms could possibly, conceivably be favoring either their own products or people who paid whatever. Is that--is that--is that a possibility? Is that something you are looking into? </p><p>BARR: Well, I can say exactly what we are looking into. I think Google has made public that they received civil investigative demands. I think it is apparent to every kinds of practices that are potentially (INAUDIBLE) could be one. </p><p>BAKER: What about the simple scale of online advertising--Facebook and Google dominate online advertising. Is that, in itself, the scale that they have is that a source of concern of potential antitrust action? </p><p>BARR: that goes to the market power and then you have to look at particular practices that may essentially exclude other competitors and--and lock in their market power. As I said successfully competing and getting into a dominant position is not itself, wrong. </p><p>BAKER: What about the use of these--there is an intriguing article by the way, the Wall Street Journal just published today that said that points out that while Facebook and Google may defend themselves on the grounds that they are not--they are not raising prices it is all they provide is free and actually they provide a tremendous benefit. </p><p>There is an interesting new argument I think in antitrust that actually what they are doing in a sense, they are charging consumers by using their--by using their data. And that--that is if you like a--a cost to the consumer a non-monetary cost perhaps, but a cost to the consumer that their data is being used and that itself could represent exploitation of a monopoly in a way that is unhealthy and potentially in breach of antitrust. </p><p>Is that an argument, is that a theory that you are open to? </p><p>BARR: I'm--I'm inclined to think that there is no free lunch and something that is free is actually getting paid for one way or another. So, I am open to that argument. </p><p>BAKER: Could one solution--one solution there be that maybe people suggested that people should be paying that I am happy to for--for Facebook to use my data but it has a value and I should be--I should be--I should receive compensation for it? </p><p>BARR: I don't want to start talking about potential policy responses. You know, there--you know, I think the--the public interest, consumer interest standard is broad enough to--to reach not just issues of pricing but wholesale practices relating to free--so called freebies, but as you--as you said at the beginning one of the interesting things about this issue is the bipartisan support for the issue. </p><p>I found that out, going around it was the only thing that some people were civil to me about during my confirmation. But we have 50-- </p><p>BAKER: You and Elizabeth Warren are on exactly the same page. </p><p>BARR: Ah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But 50 state AGs have now coalesced that we are working with all 50 state AGs. Now for those of you who have had companies dealing with state AGs and coalitions of state AGs you know, it is a pretty difficult situation when you are in a business. But there is--there is compete consensus that something should be done and we are trying to work closely with them. </p><p>One you know, if there is a basis for the litigation, if there is a basis for other enforcement action so be it. But there also may be an opportunity for legislative proposals. </p><p>BAKER: One more quick question on--on the tech which is encryption. I know there has been again, some consideration of this and I think your deputy made clear recently this is part of the litigation. This issue of seeing end to end encryption is very, very hard--obviously, it is designed that way--very, very hard for anybody to crack. And it does have law enforcement implications. </p><p>Is that something you're looking you--you--you think needs to you have already whether it is with WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is that something you want to--to address? </p><p>BARR: I mean, that's one of our highest priorities. It's something I've talked about a lot. You know, basically we are not concerned about the kind of encrypt--you know, encryption is good in that it enables, you know, the commercial use of the Internet. We're not talking about encryption, you know, in dealing with your bank or a vendor or something like that because the government, with a warrant, can go and get the information needs from the vendor or the bank. </p><p>What we're talking about is consumer products that provide into in encryption like WhatsApp and Signal and other things. Criminal organizations, and I'm talking about terrorist organizations, drug cartels, child molesting rings and, you know, kiddie porn type ring, are moving to encryption--encrypted end-to-end apps which completely defeats the ability of the government to get in there. </p><p>So, we have--we--we have increasing number of horror stories about how people are dying or being molested or whatever that we cannot get into. We know it's happening but we can't get into the communications. This also goes to telephones. We can pick up a terrorist telephone and not be able to get into it. Fortunately, sometimes we can get into it but not all the time. </p><p>And, you know, we're talking, by the way, about no diminution in privacy. What we're talking about is when you actually have a warrant based on probable cause that a crime is being committed, you cannot get the information. And I sort of sum up the whole thing this way. These businesses are essentially selling this. They're basically saying to people, hey, we can give you the protection against any scrutiny from the government whatsoever. No matter what you do, you are completely impervious to government surveillance. </p><p>That might sound good to the individual, but do we want to live in a society like that were everybody is absolutely insulated from any government scrutiny even when there's probable cause to believe a crime is underway? I don't think we do. So-- </p><p>BAKER: One more question on antitrust. A feature of U.S. economy in the last 25 years has been a dramatic increase in concentration in sector after sector, the number of mergers and acquisitions, companies going under. There's been a--you know, a recent survey said that I think 75 percent of U.S. industries had seen a significant increase in concentration from five to four companies or four to three companies. And there's tons of evidence that this is not--this is harming the consumer. </p><p>You look at things like broadband, for example, a very good example. You know quite a lot about this, I'm sure. There--you know, there were two or three major companies providing broadband services, two or three major companies providing cell phone services. There's a very interesting new book out by an economist at New York University which estimates that--that--that the prices in these areas, costs to the consumer in these areas, in the sectors of the economy where there is--there is this concentration is significant. And he compares U.S. concentration and U.S. prices to Europe, to prices in Europe. </p><p>We don't think of Europe as a particularly competitive market particularly. But, for example, broadband--average price of broadband in the United States is $68 a month. In France, it's $31 a month. And it's only $30 a month. Cell phone use, U.S. $100 a month; EU it's about half that. Whether--whether you dispute the figures are not, there has been this dramatic concentration of sector after sector, with plenty of evidence that it's--that it's harming the consumer. Do you think there needs to be a fundamental review, either through antitrust--obviously, antitrust would be an obvious way to do it, but somewhere else of actually examining these and restoring some degree of competitive pressure to many of the sectors? </p><p>BARR: No. </p><p>BAKER: Just not--you don't think it's a problem? </p><p>BARR: I think you--I think it-- </p><p>BAKER: --You don't-- </p><p>BARR: --I don't think you can make that kind of general statement across all business and all sectors. I think it's a sector by sector market by market analysis to see--you know, to assess concentration. I think some markets actually benefit from concentration--some degree of concentration. </p><p>BAKER: Which markets? Yeah. </p><p>BARR: Telecom. No, I mean-- </p><p>BAKER: --Well, maybe the--maybe the companies benefit, but from what-- </p><p>BARR: --I think that--I think the American-- </p><p>BAKER: --At least the--the consumers don't see it. </p><p>BARR: I think--I think in certain network industries, you can just--you can--you can be too Balkanized and know what has the scale necessary for the kind of innovation that we're seeing. And also, I think it's sometimes hard to assess technological change. So, you know, 5G sort of changes the--the whole idea of broadband availability and so forth. </p><p>You know, I--I think you have to look at it sector by sector with an appreciation of technology. You know, I think back when I was at Verizon, people were still, you know, looking at it as--you know, they wanted to, you know, increase the number of competitors on telephone by essentially converting the local phone companies into wholesale platforms, and everyone else glommed onto it at discounted prices. </p><p>And the regulators were, you know, spending all their time on that. Meanwhile, what happens? What happens is IP protocol on cable, which then immediately turned the cable companies into competitors. So--and--and now we have, you know, wireless and so forth. So, I think it's a sector by sector, market by market analysis, anything some markets benefit from a few--a few players. Some may, you know, require more. </p><p>BAKER: A quick couple of final questions. We're running out of time. You came--you were--you were attorney general 20--almost 30 years ago, 25 years ago the first time around in the first Bush administration when you were what, 15--15 years old, something like that? Yeah. </p><p>BARR: Forty-one, yeah. </p><p>BAKER: You're back this time. </p><p>BARR: Let me just tell you that I have a--in my view on this thing is that there's only--the only people who should be attorney general are people who are too young to know the risk or too old to care. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BAKER: Well, we'll--we won't--we won't decide which--which--which category you're in, but just what's your--I know you worked in the private sector, you've talked about it a little bit, for most of that interim period. As you come back in to the--you've obviously been somewhat hit by all these--all these impeachment and other related issues and investigations and everything else. </p><p>But as--from the point of view of business, what you've seen from outside the--the Justice Department, from outside government in the last 20 years or so, what--what--what do you want to do--and you've doubtless had to deal with the Justice Department in--in--in various roles in many ways. What do you want to do? What--what needs to be done, do you think, to--for--especially from the perspective of this business audience, to make that experience in dealing with law enforcement fairer, more effective, maybe more transparent? What--what-- </p><p>BARR: --Yeah-- </p><p>BAKER: --What are your priorities there? </p><p>BARR: So, my view is you shouldn't work in a senior position in the Department of Justice unless you--unless you've spent a lot of your time on the outside dealing with the Department of Justice, so a--a number of things. Number one, time. I think there's a risk of the department and other--other agencies, you know, they think they can take forever on the--their matters. And they do, and they come in, you know, sort of like day after day in the case, or the--it's like a--their rice bowl for the next five years is investigation. </p><p>My attitude is fish or cut bait. The government--that has huge cost of the government in terms of opportunity cost for you to be, excuse the expression, dicking around with some case that really isn't getting anywhere, and it's very costly to the--to the private sector to be under this kind of cloud. So, I want to make sure that people purposefully address a case, and there's a someone who sensible them up and say is this going to get anywhere? At the end of the day, are we going to be able to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt? And if we're not going to be in that position and it's a disproportionate amount, are we going to move on to the next thing? So, I'm impatient with, you know, sort of the backlog of cases and the time--the average life of cases. </p><p>An--another issue is, you know, esoteric legal theories. You know, enforce the law in the core meat and potatoes area where the law is supposed to apply. And they'll come in here with some kind of esoteric application of the law just because you can catch the company. The other thing is, you know, let's face it, companies are like shooting fish in a barrel. Very few companies are going to go and take the risk of a trial. </p><p>And so, over the years, a state of mind has--has arisen where, you know, you get the company over a barrel, you just get--you know, it's a question of how much money you're going to get. So, we've adopted the policy that, in order to come in to resolve the case, the prosecutors have to come in with a trial plan. They have to show that they can establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of a crime and the--and what witnesses they are going to be able to call to do that. They're going to show they have to do the work to say that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this company is guilty. </p><p>Now, if a company rushes in, you know, the day after their caught and says, hey, we want a DPA and, you know, we're willing to pay anything, I'm not saying that we wait until we develop the case, okay? You want to deal, we'll deal. But if--if a company is being held up on something that's unjust, we want to put the prosecutors through the ringer, that they actually have to have the evidence and be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is not an extortion of the company. Those are some of the ways that I--I'm trying to address it. </p><p>Now, there's a lot going on, and I can't give this my undivided attention. But--but, you know, this is one of the reforms I'd like to see. </p><p>BAKER: Final question. You gave a speech a few weeks ago which attracted a lot of attention at the University of Notre DameLaw School-- </p><p>BARR: --Um-hmm-- </p><p>BAKER: --In which you talked about the centrality of religious liberty in the United States, and its history and the mind of the fine--founding fathers and those traditional religious--religious values and how much--how important they are to a fully functioning free democracy actually said the traditional religious values are under threat now--are the target of organized destruction you said. So attacking traditional religious values whether it's over requiring catholic institutions to--to provide contraception to their employees or the LGBT rights to others people organizations that maybe disagree with--don't accept those. </p><p>Now, this attracted a lot of attention to people on the left got a lot of criticism from liberals. The New Yorker actually called it the worst speech by an Attorney General in modern history. You must some badge--badge of pride for that bit there. </p><p>But could you just give us just the--the final--it's a final--final moments a little bit more about what that is --why--why you think religious freedom is under threat and why it's--what you particularly as the Attorney General of the United States perhaps can do to defend it and to restore it to its central role in the U.S. and the U.S. Constitution--U.S. life? </p><p>BARR: Legally speaking there used to be a consensus there was a you know, just 10 years ago, 15 years ago that there should be an accommodation of religion. In fact, that passed overwhelmingly in congress and you know, Chuck Schumer was the cosponsor of it. </p><p>And, I think Teddy Kennedy and Hatch were involved. Which is, you know, maximum accommodation to religion. Religion is a good thing and we may have a general rule but if it steps on somebody's toes we try to accommodate it that's gone by the boards. </p><p>Now, we almost people--some people seem to take light enforcing particular groups to accept something that is an (INAUDIBLE) to them. You know, I think hu--humans have lived with religion for 500--evolved with religion for 50,000 years. I think it regardless and I am not saying it is just a utilitarian thing but--but it has been a very important part of--of our ability to live together in a community and--and our founders believed that they can provide the kind of freedom that they did in this system precisely because they felt that the moral values that people had pr--primarily from religion they would be able to control themselves. </p><p>So, we can give the maximum freedom and that if--if they don't have that then society become smore and more tyrannical and starts making all the rules. And, I feel that there has been a breakdown of self-control and that the government is performing the role of sort of the alleviator of the consequences that essentially subsidizing irresponsibility and misconduct so we are getting more and more of it, less and less self-control. </p><p>And, you know, government is--you know, facilitating that and I think we would be better off to take a more neutral and more accommodating opposition toward religion--not opposition hostility toward religion. I think you know, the Constitution has been misinterpreted too. </p><p>BAKER: This is a (INAUDIBLE) we had a session this morning Chief Executives are increasingly you know, demanded to take public stances on some of these issues in ways that a lot of religious people object to. Is that some--is that--is that a threat again, to the religious freedom values that you are talking about? </p><p>BARR: What--what do you mean? </p><p>BAKER: For example, they are--are--are strongly under pressure in all of these issues of social, social concern whether it be again, LGBT rights for example, some people may object to those. They may find it very difficult to have that you know a--a religious view which is consistent to what you--but you think--but it does seem like the prevailing atmosphere these days requires chief executives to embrace rights that may be--and we have seen some of these religious (INAUDIBLE) come along with you know, the stuff that sort of Chick-fil-A is going through or some of these other issues. We are seeing you know, more and more pressure on companies. You know, some people regard it as a good thing. What is your view? </p><p>BARR: My view is you know I--I--I don't think it's a good development to have you know, all these social warriors you know, essentially pushing companies to take positions on these kinds of things. Those are the companies that do it's fine. That's their choice and if the shareholders are happy that's fine too. </p><p>But what I was saying is and I think I said this at my confirmation you know, it is one thing--I personally do not believe that gay people should be discriminated against in work. That's not currently in our law but I have no problem with that. I think that's the right thing. But on the other hand I think there has to be accommodation so that if a catholic school system doesn't want to have you know, a gay person who is living in a single sex marriage as a teacher they should be able to say that. </p><p>So, my attitude is live and let live and there has to be space for a different you know, real diversity. When people talk about diversity they are not really talking about diversity. I want real diversity in our society. I want people to--to be able to find their own communities and live according to their values. I think--I think there is a group in our society you know, that views their mission as going around bludgeoning everyone into uniformity. And I said in my Notre Dame speech it's a little bit like the Roman Empire where you know, the Christians were good citizens. I mean they were the best fighters in the Roman Army-- </p><p>BAKER: They were no match for the Lions though were they? </p><p>BARR: No but that was later--that was earlier. You know, and yet they wouldn't let the Christians many of the emperors would not let the Christians live in peace. They weren't satisfied unless they actually got up and sacrificed to the emperor as a God. You sort of feel a little bit of the same spirit now is that unless the little sisters of the poor provide contraception, ok, there is something horrible and outrageous going on in society. I just I don't like that. </p><p>BAKER: And we'll have to leave it there. </p><p>BARR: Thank you very much. </p><p>BAKER: Ladies and gentleman please (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you very much. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-4F21-F15W-H02B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Barr on Tuesday signaled that the Justice Department plans to step up its scrutiny of Silicon Valley, exploring new legal tools to probe companies for their privacy abuses and the way they police content online.</p><p>Barr didn't mention companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google by name, but his speech - delivered to state law enforcement officials in Washington - amounted to the latest high-profile warning for Silicon Valley at a moment when major tech companies already are under investigation for their business practices. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The attorney general also said the Justice Department is taking a closer look at decades-old laws that spare tech companies from being held liable for content posted by their users. Those rules, known as Section 230, are considered some of the most prized legal protections in Silicon Valley, sparing them from some lawsuits and other punishments.</p><p>\"We've heard widespread concerns from consumers, businesses, [and] entrepreneurs, including about stagnated innovation, high prices, lack of choice, privacy, transparency and public safety, and in response, DOJ initiated a review into market-leading online platforms,\" Barr said.</p><p>The attorney general later added: \"We are thinking critically about how DOJ and our state partners can address other topics related to online platforms such as privacy, transparency, consumer fraud, child exploitation or public safety.\"</p><p>In July, the Justice Department announced a wide-ranging review of \"market-leading online platforms,\" citing competition concerns in \"search, social media, and some retail services online.\" Since then, the agency's antitrust division has embarked on more focused antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, amounting to a major new legal headache for an industry that long dodged such regulatory scrutiny in Washington.</p><p>Opening his speech, Barr joked that Democrats and Republicans had found rare alignment in their concerns about big tech. He said the same about state attorneys general, nearly all of whom have banded together across the country to open their own probes into Facebook and Google to see if they have harmed competition or consumers.</p><p>\"I think this demonstrates the importance of these issues to Americans across the country regardless of location or political persuasion,\" Barr said.</p><p>The attorney general stressed the department's review of major technology companies would encompass far more than traditional antitrust concerns, exploring the extent to which their massive data stores offer them a competitive advantage and even their approach to political posts, photos and videos online.</p><p>Barr pointed to unnamed critics in raising concerns that social media sites may stifle some \"third-party speech, including political speech, selectively and with immunity.\" His concerns appear to echo those of President Trump, who has accused Facebook, Google and other companies of censoring conservatives online. Trump has not provided systemic evidence of such political bias, and the three major social media companies have denied it.</p><p>In response, Barr said the Justice Department is exploring recommending possible changes to Section 230, pointing to critics who say the rules have been \"expanded far beyond what Congress originally intended.\" Amazon, Facebook, Google and their top Washington advocates have fought fiercely for years to protect their liability shield, pointing to the fact that it actually gives them the legal basis for moderating their sites in the first place.</p><p>Barr, however, said the department is \"thinking critically on the issue.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-eb362d0fc0594686827db29977fdbc01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPS-5CH1-JB4M-V04Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><timeReceived>9:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Barr Delivers Remarks on China Policy at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Washington: Offices of the United States Attorneys has issued the following news release:</p><p>Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today\u2019s event. I\u2019d also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.</p><p>It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \u201c[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d[1]Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.</p><p>It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America\u2019s reengagement with the People\u2019s Republic of China, which began with President Nixon\u2019s historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China\u2019s immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people \u2026. This last impression\u2014of the reality of China\u2019s colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d[3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China\u2019s remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d[4] That is precisely what China has done. China\u2019s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\u2019s GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \u201ccloser to center stage,\u201d \u201cbuilding a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\u201d and replacing the American Dream with the \u201cChinese solution.\u201d[5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\u2019s time has arrived.</p><p>The People\u2019s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world\u2019s chess grandmasters. But the PRC\u2019s interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6] \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7]</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.</p><p>As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S -China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201d[8]The article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.</p><p>China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d[9]</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d[10]</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you. As a U.S Chamber of Commerce report put it, \u201c[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\u201d[12]</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China\u2019s political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration\u2019s China Strategy recognizes, \u201cthe CCP\u2019s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\u2019s borders.\u201d[13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movieWorld War Zdepicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbusterDr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d[14]Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d[15]</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d[16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.</p><p>In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d[17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18]</p><p>These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney producedKundun, the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.</p><p>But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized forKundun, calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d[19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park\u2019s 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \u201c[T]he time has come,\u201d he said, \u201cindeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\u201d[20]</p><p>So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \u201cStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\u201d[21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC\u2019s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3532675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CG-91K1-F0YC-N26F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum   especially Director Elaine Didier   for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. </p><p>Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today. It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century   that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that '[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.'[1][1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2][2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party. It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: 'If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people . This last impression of the reality of China's colossal potential is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.'[3][3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: 'hide your strength and bide your time.'[4][4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving 'closer to center stage,' 'building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,' and replacing the American Dream with the 'Chinese solution.'[5][5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, 'Made in China 2025' sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.'Made in China 2025' is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's 'Belt and Road' infrastructure initiative. Although billed as 'foreign aid,' in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,' a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6][6] 'Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,' in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7][7]The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer   allowing us to serve as the world's 'arsenal of democracy.' China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's 'arsenal of dictatorship.'How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled 'How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.'[8][8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers   including American companies   from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively 'creating their own competitors.'[9][9]America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as 'APIs.' As one Defense Health Agency official noted, '[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],' it 'could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.'[10][10]To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a 'high-value-added-industry' and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11][11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, '[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.'[12][12]Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, 'the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.'[13][13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the 'Ancient One,' a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that 'if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.'[14][14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say '[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'[15][15]These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, '[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.'[16][16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which 'liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.'[17][17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives   efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the 'guanxi'   or system of influential social networks necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18][18]These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded 'Confucius Institutes,' which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a 'stupid mistake.'[19][19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.During the Cold War, Lewis Powell   later Justice Powell   sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. '[T]he time has come,' he said, 'indeed, it is long overdue for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.'[20][20]So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: 'Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.'[21][21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we the American people, American government, and American business together can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. [1][22] Robert C.

I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum especially Director Elaine Didier for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.</p><p>It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \"[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.\"[1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.</p><p>It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impressionof the reality of China's colossal potentialis perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\"[3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\"[4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \"closer to center stage,\" \"building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\" and replacing the American Dream with the \"Chinese solution.\"[5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkriegan aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6] \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7]</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.</p><p>As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer allowing us to serve as the world's \"arsenal of democracy.\" China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\"[8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers including American companies from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"[9]</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\" As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"[10]</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"[12]</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.\"[13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influenceeven at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\"[14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \"[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"[15]</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative marketboth through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywoodand eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\"[16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.</p><p>In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\"[17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of Chinathe world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" or system of influential social networksnecessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18]</p><p>These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.</p><p>But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\"[19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell later Justice Powell sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overduefor the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\"[20]</p><p>So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\"[21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that wethe American people, American government, and American business togethercan do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p><p>[1] Robert C.

Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far rivaling its peers, while capturing 75 percent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.</p><p>\"They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\" he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Some of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users' personal information.

Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far rivaling its peers, while capturing 75 percent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.</p><p>\"They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\" he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Some of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users' personal information. Their early rebukes raised the stakes for Google, threatening top-to-bottom scrutiny of its sprawling business beyond just ads. Paxton promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it's done fairly,\" said Sean Reyes, the Republican attorney general of Utah.

Now, an antitrust investigation into Facebook announced by New York Attorney General Letitia James in September has amassed a Super Friends-like team of 46 other attorneys general to probe Facebook for potential antitrust violations. When James' Facebook investigation was first announced, only eight other attorneys general were involved.</p><p>It's neither the first tech probe involving nearly every state's attorney general (see: a similar investigation into Google), nor is it James' first time targeting tech companies. The Facebook investigation will focus on whether the company put consumer data at risk, whether it has reduced the quality of customers' choices \u2013 hitting on the company's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp \u2013 and increased the price of advertising. On Monday, James met with a group of attorneys general and other federal officials in Manhattan about building an antitrust case against Facebook.</p><p> The probe comes amid questions about whether Big Tech giants like Facebook and Google should be broken up. Recently, that particular question has reached larger stages, like the Democratic presidential primary debates, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren coming out strongly in favor of breaking up the firms.</p><p> For the rest of today's tech news, head over to First Read Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

They can break up monopolies, for example, and penalize companies for privacy abuses. But some state officials contend that Washington bears some of the blame for the tech industry's string of scandals. Lawmakers in Congress long have struggled to adopt a national law targeting tech giants' data-collection practices, while federal agencies have allowed many of the headline-grabbing mishaps at Facebook and Google to go unpunished.</p><p>In response, states like Arizona and Mississippi are taking aim at Google for the way it collects and monetizes Web users' data. Washington, meanwhile, is challenging Facebook's business practices in court. There are also \"numerous bipartisan discussions\" among Democrats and Republicans about other areas where attorneys general can coordinate their attention on Big Tech, Landry said.</p><p>\"We are in a moment where the federal government's level of effectiveness and engagement on a range of issues, on technology, consumer protection and privacy, is limited,\" added Phil Weiser (D), Colorado's attorney general. Absent federal intervention, he said, \"states in general or state AGs are able to act.\"</p><p>Asked about the criticisms, Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local public policy, said the tech giant has had \"productive conversations\" with state attorneys general. \"Many officials have approached us in a constructive manner, focused on solutions that ensure all companies are protecting people's information, and we look forward to working with them,\" he added in a statement.</p><p>\"Privacy and security are built into all of our products, and we will continue to engage constructively with state attorneys general on policy issues,\" Google said in a statement.</p><p>The appetite for action seemed apparent last week, when state officials gathered in Washington for events that included an annual forum with the National Association of Attorneys General, of which Landry is president. Concerns about the tech industry's privacy practices were on full display, while a few miles away, the District appeared in court to argue that Facebook had deceived its users about its approach to collecting and monetizing their data. The lawsuit stems from Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data about roughly 8 million of the site's users without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>Federal watchdogs have been probing the matter for nearly a year, and they could soon bring a historic fine. But D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) opted not to wait for his federal counterparts, and he filed his case in December, which Facebook has sought to dismiss on grounds that the District lacks jurisdiction. Both sides are set to air their next round of arguments in front of a D.C. Superior Court judge next week. A slew of additional states, including New York and Pennsylvania, are proceeding with Facebook probes of their own.</p><p>Other state attorneys general have set their sights on Google, fearing the search, advertising and mobile giant knows too much about consumers and can easily squash its competitors. Some states' calls for stronger antitrust enforcement stand in stark contrast with Washington, where federal regulators investigated Google but ultimately decided in 2013 against breaking apart the company.</p><p>The latest to take aim was Arizona's attorney general, Mark Brnovich (R), who began investigating the tech giant's data-collection practices in 2018. Last week, Brnovich reaffirmed his concerns with Google's use of location data gleaned from Android smartphones during a private event for fellow Republican attorneys general, according to a person who attended the gathering but asked not to be identified because the event was off record. Brnovich also raised questions about Google's search practices, particularly the company's approach to surfacing results to queries about local businesses, the person said.</p><p>Asked Thursday if the states needed to open an antitrust probe of Google, Brnovich replied: \"Maybe,\" adding: \"I think there are a lot of us in the AG world that are collecting information, trying to get documents and trying to get to the bottom of whether that's a reasonable step or a reasonable option.\" He said he could not comment on any open investigations.</p><p>Google's challenges could span far beyond Arizona. Before becoming Minnesota's attorney general, Democrat Keith Ellison argued in Congress for the federal government to embark on an antitrust probe of the tech giant. Ellison's office declined to comment for this story. In Missouri, meanwhile, the state embarked on a wide-ranging antitrust and privacy investigation into Google under former attorney general Josh Hawley, who left the office for the U.S. Senate in January. A spokesman for his successor declined to say if it's still underway.</p><p>Louisiana's Landry slammed Google last week for being \"more and more manipulative\" with its search results. In Mississippi, Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has sued the company for its handling of students' data. For years, the two sides have warred repeatedly, with Google at one point suggesting that Hood had wrongly targeted the company with the aid of its foes in the movie industry. In an interview, Hood faulted Google for trying to \"send a message to other states that we will sue you.\"</p><p>\"You cannot allow this power to accumulate in the hands of this few people,\" Hood said. \"At some point, there's going to have to be a reckoning for it.\"</p><p>In these and other probes, state attorneys general are powerful in their own right: They can leverage local laws to fine companies for their misdeeds. In some cases, their rules are tougher than what the federal government has at its disposal - especially in California under a landmark privacy statute adopted in 2018.</p><p>But they often band together to take aim at common targets. At their most effective, state attorneys general can prod the federal government to do the same. The tech industry learned that lesson firsthand two decades ago, when state attorneys general helped drive a landmark U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and sought later to block a settlement out of concern that the federal government had been too soft on the company.</p><p>The most recent wave of activity began in September, when the Justice Department asked attorneys general to discuss the power of Facebook, Google and online platforms. The session in Washington had been designed to probe claims that some tech companies censor conservatives - a concern Democrats don't share - but the conversation proved far more wide ranging, with Hood and others weighing whether to partner in a formal way to study big tech companies.</p><p>Roughly six months after that DOJ summit, Xavier Becerra (D), California's attorney general, said their early talks were \"perceived as something worthwhile.\" He acknowledged in an interview there's been \"increased discussions among the state AGs\" about the privacy challenges and other troubles posed by some of the tech industry's biggest players.</p><p>Becerra added: \"I think everyone's trying to get a handle on what we can do.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-b7a8e48c-4774-11e9-90f0-0ccfeec87a61</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-K8K1-DXXY-33SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They can break up monopolies, for example, and penalize companies for privacy abuses. But some state officials contend that Washington bears some of the blame for the tech industry's string of scandals. Lawmakers in Congress long have struggled to adopt a national law targeting tech giants' data-collection practices, while federal agencies have allowed many of the headline-grabbing mishaps at Facebook and Google to go unpunished.</p><p>In response, states like Arizona and Mississippi are taking aim at Google for the way it collects and monetizes Web users' data. Washington, meanwhile, is challenging Facebook's business practices in court. There are also \"numerous bipartisan discussions\" among Democrats and Republicans about other areas where attorneys general can coordinate their attention on Big Tech, Landry said.</p><p>\"We are in a moment where the federal government's level of effectiveness and engagement on a range of issues, on technology, consumer protection and privacy, is limited,\" added Phil Weiser (D), Colorado's attorney general. Absent federal intervention, he said, \"states in general or state AGs are able to act.\"</p><p>Asked about the criticisms, Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local public policy, said the tech giant has had \"productive conversations\" with state attorneys general. \"Many officials have approached us in a constructive manner, focused on solutions that ensure all companies are protecting people's information, and we look forward to working with them,\" he added in a statement.</p><p>\"Privacy and security are built into all of our products, and we will continue to engage constructively with state attorneys general on policy issues,\" Google said in a statement.</p><p>The appetite for action seemed apparent last week, when state officials gathered in Washington for events that included an annual forum with the National Association of Attorneys General, of which Landry is president. Concerns about the tech industry's privacy practices were on full display, while a few miles away, the District appeared in court to argue that Facebook had deceived its users about its approach to collecting and monetizing their data. The lawsuit stems from Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data about roughly 8 million of the site's users without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>Federal watchdogs have been probing the matter for nearly a year, and they could soon bring a historic fine. But D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) opted not to wait for his federal counterparts, and he filed his case in December, which Facebook has sought to dismiss on grounds that the District lacks jurisdiction. Both sides are set to air their next round of arguments in front of a D.C. Superior Court judge next week. A slew of additional states, including New York and Pennsylvania, are proceeding with Facebook probes of their own.</p><p>Other state attorneys general have set their sights on Google, fearing the search, advertising and mobile giant knows too much about consumers and can easily squash its competitors. Some states' calls for stronger antitrust enforcement stand in stark contrast with Washington, where federal regulators investigated Google but ultimately decided in 2013 against breaking apart the company.</p><p>The latest to take aim was Arizona's attorney general, Mark Brnovich (R), who began investigating the tech giant's data-collection practices in 2018. Last week, Brnovich reaffirmed his concerns with Google's use of location data gleaned from Android smartphones during a private event for fellow Republican attorneys general, according to a person who attended the gathering but asked not to be identified because the event was off record. Brnovich also raised questions about Google's search practices, particularly the company's approach to surfacing results to queries about local businesses, the person said.</p><p>Asked Thursday if the states needed to open an antitrust probe of Google, Brnovich replied: \"Maybe,\" adding: \"I think there are a lot of us in the AG world that are collecting information, trying to get documents and trying to get to the bottom of whether that's a reasonable step or a reasonable option.\" He said he could not comment on any open investigations.</p><p>Google's challenges could span far beyond Arizona. Before becoming Minnesota's attorney general, Democrat Keith Ellison argued in Congress for the federal government to embark on an antitrust probe of the tech giant. Ellison's office declined to comment for this story. In Missouri, meanwhile, the state embarked on a wide-ranging antitrust and privacy investigation into Google under former attorney general Josh Hawley, who left the office for the U.S. Senate in January. A spokesman for his successor declined to say if it's still underway.</p><p>Louisiana's Landry slammed Google last week for being \"more and more manipulative\" with its search results. In Mississippi, Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has sued the company for its handling of students' data. For years, the two sides have warred repeatedly, with Google at one point suggesting that Hood had wrongly targeted the company with the aid of its foes in the movie industry. In an interview, Hood faulted Google for trying to \"send a message to other states that we will sue you.\"</p><p>\"You cannot allow this power to accumulate in the hands of this few people,\" Hood said. \"At some point, there's going to have to be a reckoning for it.\"</p><p>In these and other probes, state attorneys general are powerful in their own right: They can leverage local laws to fine companies for their misdeeds.

The session in Washington had been designed to probe claims that some tech companies censor conservatives - a concern Democrats don't share - but the conversation proved far more wide ranging, with Hood and others weighing whether to partner in a formal way to study big tech companies.</p><p>Roughly six months after that DOJ summit, Xavier Becerra (D), California's attorney general, said their early talks were \"perceived as something worthwhile.\" He acknowledged in an interview there's been \"increased discussions among the state AGs\" about the privacy challenges and other troubles posed by some of the tech industry's biggest players.</p><p>Becerra added: \"I think everyone's trying to get a handle on what we can do.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-b7a8e48c477411e990f00ccfeec87a61</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-F801-JCDY-T31D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><timeReceived>11:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The sooner it waves goodbye, the better. The question is, who wants it?   DirecTV has faded into the background at AT&amp;T, a company now entirely focused  on competing in 5G wireless connectivity and online television. Any DirecTV user can attest to how the service has been neglected in recent years, and the business might be forgotten by investors if it weren\u2019t for the headline-grabbing subscriber losses it\u2019s mounted each quarter.   AT&amp;T, which also owns the U-Verse brand, has lost about 6 million traditional pay-TV customers overall in just the last two years. The Covid-19 pandemic is causing cord-cutting to accelerate as consumers look to save money by switching to streaming-video services such as Netflix and AT&amp;T\u2019s own HBO Max. So while AT&amp;T paid $49 billion when it bought DirecTV, it\u2019d be lucky to fetch even half that now. One analyst, John Butler of Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates a potential sale price of just $20 billion.   Some may be wondering, what on earth would any buyer want with a satellite-TV business anyway? The answer is cash. DirecTV still throws off quite a bit of it, which explains why private equity firms including Apollo Global Management Inc. and Platinum Equity are said to be taking a look. Financial suitors want businesses that generate lots of cash because they can support dividends and the debt load needed to take them private \u2014 although DirecTV\u2019s ability to do so is certainly diminishing.    Cash is one reason AT&amp;T has waffled over whether to part with DirecTV; its earnings help the parent company chip away at its own mountain of debt. According to a Los Angeles Times article in January, AT&amp;T said that DirecTV had generated $22 billion of cash flow since 2015. But now that Randall Stephenson, the CEO who bought DirecTV,  has retired, and AT&amp;T has  a new linear TV product called AT&amp;T TV, it no longer makes sense to hold on to a tired brand. DirecTV also won\u2019t rebound after the pandemic, and given the uncertainty around sports, there\u2019s now a question mark on the value of its NFL Sunday Ticket package.   Satellite TV does continue to serve a crucial demographic: rural America. There, streaming apps often aren\u2019t an option; instead, the choice is between DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. In fact, roughly half of satellite churn is back and forth between DirecTV and Dish, according to a research report last September by Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson LLC. As they both try to offset subscriber shortfalls and higher programming costs, DirecTV has turned to  price hikes and Dish has embraced channel blackouts. This is why Dish has long been considered the most obvious merger partner for DirecTV, an idea that seems to have been deterred only by the regulatory hurdles. So even as AT&amp;T holds formal discussions with private equity suitors, there would seem to be a high likelihood that Dish billionaire Charlie Ergen also joins the fray. The satellite business may be the awkward sibling of the AT&amp;T family, but it\u2019s a piggy bank for Ergen\u2019s desire to  launch his own 5G wireless network.   This may be the last chance for DirecTV and Dish to strike a deal. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission\u2019s approval of T-Mobile US Inc.\u2019s purchase of Sprint Corp., which was backed by a court ruling this year,  opened the door to other mergers between direct rivals in highly concentrated markets. That  lax approach to antitrust may end, though, if Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump for the presidency in November. Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat leading a House investigation into  Big Tech\u2019s anticompetitive practices, told Bloomberg News last week that Biden would likely  pursue an aggressive antitrust policy.   While a group of state attorneys general were unsuccessful in trying to block T-Mobile\u2019s takeover of Sprint,  their efforts signaled that states are willing to step in when they see regulators drop the ball. As AT&amp;T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens noted in an interview in January, contending with antitrust matters now means squaring off against the \u201cthree-headed monster\u201d of the DOJ, FCC and states. \u201cOr maybe a 52-headed monster, I should say,\u201d he added.   AT&amp;T may not want to take the risk of that monster coming after it \u2014 again. Its $109 billion deal for WarnerMedia (then called Time Warner Inc.) got tied up in a legal battle with the Justice Department for well over a year. New CEO John Stankey, who oversaw that effort, probably doesn\u2019t want a repeat. The company has enough on its plate, with the virus  halting productions at WarnerMedia and starving  HBO Max of content. Considering AT&amp;T\u2019s $178 billion of net debt, including lease obligations, it\u2019d be prudent to sell DirecTV to whoever offers a combination of best price and best chances of getting a deal done quickly.

D...</p><p>(Bloomberg Opinion) -- AT&amp;T Inc. is once again  looking to sell its DirecTV unit, a business that has lost billions of dollars in value since the wireless carrier acquired it in 2015. The sooner it waves goodbye, the better. The question is, who wants it?   DirecTV has faded into the background at AT&amp;T, a company now entirely focused  on competing in 5G wireless connectivity and online television. Any DirecTV user can attest to how the service has been neglected in recent years, and the business might be forgotten by investors if it weren\u2019t for the headline-grabbing subscriber losses it\u2019s mounted each quarter.   AT&amp;T, which also owns the U-Verse brand, has lost about 6 million traditional pay-TV customers overall in just the last two years. The Covid-19 pandemic is causing cord-cutting to accelerate as consumers look to save money by switching to streaming-video services such as Netflix and AT&amp;T\u2019s own HBO Max. So while AT&amp;T paid $49 billion when it bought DirecTV, it\u2019d be lucky to fetch even half that now. One analyst, John Butler of Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates a potential sale price of just $20 billion.   Some may be wondering, what on earth would any buyer want with a satellite-TV business anyway? The answer is cash. DirecTV still throws off quite a bit of it, which explains why private equity firms including Apollo Global Management Inc. and Platinum Equity are said to be taking a look. Financial suitors want businesses that generate lots of cash because they can support dividends and the debt load needed to take them private \u2014 although DirecTV\u2019s ability to do so is certainly diminishing.    Cash is one reason AT&amp;T has waffled over whether to part with DirecTV; its earnings help the parent company chip away at its own mountain of debt. According to a Los Angeles Times article in January, AT&amp;T said that DirecTV had generated $22 billion of cash flow since 2015. But now that Randall Stephenson, the CEO who bought DirecTV,  has retired, and AT&amp;T has  a new linear TV product called AT&amp;T TV, it no longer makes sense to hold on to a tired brand. DirecTV also won\u2019t rebound after the pandemic, and given the uncertainty around sports, there\u2019s now a question mark on the value of its NFL Sunday Ticket package.   Satellite TV does continue to serve a crucial demographic: rural America. There, streaming apps often aren\u2019t an option; instead, the choice is between DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. In fact, roughly half of satellite churn is back and forth between DirecTV and Dish, according to a research report last September by Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson LLC. As they both try to offset subscriber shortfalls and higher programming costs, DirecTV has turned to  price hikes and Dish has embraced channel blackouts. This is why Dish has long been considered the most obvious merger partner for DirecTV, an idea that seems to have been deterred only by the regulatory hurdles. So even as AT&amp;T holds formal discussions with private equity suitors, there would seem to be a high likelihood that Dish billionaire Charlie Ergen also joins the fray. The satellite business may be the awkward sibling of the AT&amp;T family, but it\u2019s a piggy bank for Ergen\u2019s desire to  launch his own 5G wireless network.   This may be the last chance for DirecTV and Dish to strike a deal. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission\u2019s approval of T-Mobile US Inc.\u2019s purchase of Sprint Corp., which was backed by a court ruling this year,  opened the door to other mergers between direct rivals in highly concentrated markets. That  lax approach to antitrust may end, though, if Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump for the presidency in November. Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat leading a House investigation into  Big Tech\u2019s anticompetitive practices, told Bloomberg News last week that Biden would likely  pursue an aggressive antitrust policy.   While a group of state attorneys general were unsuccessful in trying to block T-Mobile\u2019s takeover of Sprint,  their efforts signaled that states are willing to step in when they see regulators drop the ball. As AT&amp;T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens noted in an interview in January, contending with antitrust matters now means squaring off against the \u201cthree-headed monster\u201d of the DOJ, FCC and states. \u201cOr maybe a 52-headed monster, I should say,\u201d he added.   AT&amp;T may not want to take the risk of that monster coming after it \u2014 again. Its $109 billion deal for WarnerMedia (then called Time Warner Inc.) got tied up in a legal battle with the Justice Department for well over a year. New CEO John Stankey, who oversaw that effort, probably doesn\u2019t want a repeat. The company has enough on its plate, with the virus  halting productions at WarnerMedia and starving  HBO Max of content. Considering AT&amp;T\u2019s $178 billion of net debt, including lease obligations, it\u2019d be prudent to sell DirecTV to whoever offers a combination of best price and best chances of getting a deal done quickly.

China Tech War Author Gordon Chang also with us this morning is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell Forbes Media Chairman and Former Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes and Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tepper. Great to see everybody this morning, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>Gordon, it's good to have you here. You've been such as really an important student and writer of what's taking place in China? What is your reaction of this conversation that apparently took place according to John Bolton between the President and Chinese President Xi Jinping?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\", AUTHOR: Robert Lighthizer was very clear in his Senate Finance Committee testimony yesterday. So right now it's up to death in doubt but even if what Bolton said was true what President Trump said to Xi Jinping was basically in line with what previous Presidents have said and their approach to China?</p><p>And that goes all the way back to Nixon but especially in the previous 2 administrations. So I don't think that approach works. I don't like it. I think it's counterproductive but none the less I'm in the minority on this and the mainstream view is what basically Trump did?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Gordon there is so many levels to the relationship with China and I know you know all of them back and forth. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo it's going to be holding this meeting this week in Hawaii with his Chinese counterpart in that few are using these talks as an opportunity to stress the need for reciprocal dealings on a number of issues.</p><p>The meeting comes amid unrest in Hong Kong as well as the global Coronavirus pandemic. As we speak there are troops facing off against one another on the China/India border and of course that's not even including all of the other behavior like the theft of intellectual property going on. What's your take in terms of the U. S./China relationship going forward?</p><p>CHANG: Well, I think the Secretary Pompeo and Young who were starting Tuesday night they can paper over differences. They can talk about it. They can continue discussions as they said they would but the fundamental problem is that Chinese foreign policy right now is extremely provocative and belligerent.</p><p>I mean it's not just with regard to the United States is with regard to for instance India as you point out where they had that Bill flash on Monday night. Also you know we're seeing dangerous intercepts of the U. S. Navy and the global comments.</p><p>China has picked up the tempo of that there all of these incidents in the South China Sea and East China Sea the threats of invasion of Taiwan, Beijing is lashing out Xi Jinping the Chinese ruler is looking for a victory. He's probably going to end up with a string of defeats and that's when China becomes even more dangerous.</p><p>So although the diplomats can talk the reality is that Xi Jinping is pushing the world in a very, very dangerous direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what could come out of these talks then Gordon? I mean what's the point of having these diplomatic talks when we know about the dictatorship and the behavior of the Chinese Communist Party? Is Pompeo really going to be able to change any of these?</p><p>CHANG: I actually don't think so but I think the one thing that Secretary Pompeo can do which he is really good at doing is making it clear to China what the consequences of his actions will be? He has been extremely stern. He has actually taken measures instead of just talking about this.</p><p>And so I think that the Chinese will at least at the diplomatic level will take into account what Secretary Pompeo was saying but the problem is this not the Chinese diplomats. The problem is Xi Jinping the Chinese ruler.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And is he - I mean is there any pressure that he could face in terms of the people revolting? Let's look at this India/China conflict for example. Secretary Pompeo told me 2 weeks ago that China is - Xi Jinping is using this opportunity of the pandemic to gain more territory.</p><p>India holding funerals now for some of the 20 soldiers killed this week in a battle that they have a land border between the 2 countries. Diplomats urging both sides not to escalate the situation, but 20 people are already dead, Gordon?</p><p>CHANG: Yes. And there are a couple of folds to this story. One of them is that there are the Chinese casualties might be higher. Beijing's not talking about that. If news of casualties starts to be a particularly through the Chinese social media, Xi Jinping will be in trouble because the Chinese toll probably is higher.</p><p>But the one thing that Xi Jinping has suffered as a setback is that in India right now there is white hot anger against China. We are going to see India's - I think ripped out and replaced all Chinese telecom equipment. There is going to be this boycott which is started in the Indian population of Chinese goods.</p><p>And I think that you will see India move much closer to the United States, Japan, Vietnam and Australia and much farther away from China. This looks like a fundamental shift in Indian foreign policy because the deaths of the Indian soldiers and by the way China started despite the deaths of the Indian soldiers I think it's a turning point from which China can not actually influence India anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it certainly feels like maybe this is going to be the place where many companies decide to put supply chains in India and work with the U. S. in that regard as well to try to get the supply chains out of China.</p><p>Gordon, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for your important insights on the subject Gordon. We'll see soon.</p><p>CHANG: Thank you so much Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you sir. Gordon Chang, joining us there. We are just getting started this morning. We've got a lot coming up later this hour I'll be speaking with Former Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove as some states see record spikes in new Coronavirus cases don't miss that.</p><p>And then the 7:00 am hour Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here as the GOP unveils its police reform bill. Plus Merrill Lynch Wealth Management President Andy Sieg is telling me the biggest market moves he's watching this morning.</p><p>As we navigate Wall Street wrestling with reopenings as well. Democratic Senator from Delaware Chris Coons is here as Democrats and Republicans clash over what to include in that police reform legislation?</p><p>And then at 8:00 am eastern Kroger's Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen will join us with explosive reaction to the retail giant's earnings that's coming up. And Texas Senator Ted Cruz joining me on his plans to target Google's anti conservative bias.</p><p>Then I'll speak exclusively with U. S. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza on the fight to save America's small business big show a lot coming up. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are searching for direction this morning ahead of the weekly jobless numbers out this morning. Take a look DOW Futures are down 32 points right now. The NASDAQ is up it's up just a 7 points but the S&amp;P is also negative down about 3 points.</p><p>Market snapped a 3 day winning streak yesterday with declines with the DOW down 170 points and the S&amp;P down 11, the NASDAQ was up yesterday as well 14 points. There are concerns however growing over the spike of new Coronavirus cases.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of Verdence Leo Kelly. Leo, great to have you this morning thanks very much. How concerned are you with the fact that as we reopen America we're seeing an increase in spikes? Is this going to take us back a few steps?</p><p>LEO KELLY, VERDENCE CEO: Well, obviously you have to be concerned at any increase in Coronavirus spikes. But I think we have to take a few other points into consideration. One is we're doing more testing so we're going to see more cases.</p><p>Secondly there's an interesting statistic in some of these states where are hospitalizations are going up where as people come back to do elective procedures they're being tested for Coronavirus so you're going to see more Coronavirus cases in hospitals as a result of all this.</p><p>So I think we have to focus on the death rate. I think we have to focus on the vulnerable. I don't think the country's going to have an appetite to do a complete shutdown again. I think the market is showing us that that's what it believes as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So you've got initial jobless claims out this morning in about 2 hour's time. Economists are predicting another 1.3 million jobs lost in the last week that would be 44.2 million jobs lost since the end of March. Leo how does this play into how you invest today?</p><p>KELLY: Well, I think when you look at this quarter as damaging and as difficult as this quarter is in terms of the statistics are on unemployment and small businesses that's what the Fed came in to do and that's what the stimulus came into solve for was to get us through this moment.</p><p>The market is a forward forecasting mechanism and so while the jobs numbers going to be ugly today the key is what the pace of change the rate of change is? And as long as the economic data continues to improve then we have to look forward beyond what we're going through today in terms of our investment strategy?</p><p>As I've said before here on the show Maria as you know rate of change on the economy rate of change on the science and take note of the political atmosphere around shut down so those are the 3 key variables. And as long as they continue to improve the market should stay strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Tepper?</p><p>MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO: Leo, when it comes to putting new cash to work what your favorite sectors or industries right now?</p><p>KELLY: Well, new cash to work today is a little bit tougher proposition because the market has run its gotten - what I could see a little bit ahead of itself it's already in my opinion discounting a successful outcome for the year or almost at a high so it's a little bit more difficult today.</p><p>There are still some lagging areas like industrials and financials that are interesting the small caps continue to rebound but they've made a big run. Frankly cash is a good place to be right now. We're going to have volatility. I don't - volatility is this is in the DNA of an equity investor so holding cash isn't bad.</p><p>We also by the way like private equity. There are opportunities in the private equity world maybe not in the mainstream venture capital world but there are opportunities in private equity that give you a chance to make up a bit of a higher yield.</p><p>BARITORMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Leo, we'll be watching. We'll take a look at those PE ideas. Leo thanks so much Leo Kelly for joining us this morning. Coming up Colin Kaepernick makes a comeback President Trump is running reverse play softening his stance on the NFL stars kneeling controversy the President's take, coming up next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Colin Kaepernick may make a return to the NFL. President Trump said last night he's on board with Kaepernick returning to the league, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If he has the ability, if somebody would take him. You're not going to lose games because wanting to be politically correct. They had somebody that was going to win games. They will sign him it doesn't matter who they are?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And one team is giving the former quarterback a closer look, the Los Angeles Chargers Head Coach Anthony Lynn says this it would be crazy not to have him on that workout list, stay talent of that caliber that's available under these circumstances that were in right now. I would think most teams would explore that. Dagen McDowell, your reaction?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: That it's nice to hear that from President Trump but this is - people look at Colin Kaepernick now and what he was doing to draw attention to racial injustice. The treatment of black men and women by some members of Police Departments across the country even racism taking a knee, they look back and see what he was trying to tell people particularly following the murder of George Floyd?</p><p>And I said this before in terms of what we started seeing from beginning with a NASCAR official taking a knee but saluting during the National Anthem? This is going to be a form of powerful but quiet protest across the country to draw attention to these weighty important issues and is going to be happening across sports.</p><p>And so I think the President and people who don't like it need to realize it's not political it is deeply personal for these men and women beginning with Colin Kaepernick.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really good way to put it. Mark how do you see it?</p><p>TEPPER: The way I see it is the key here is Kaepernick should not be blacklisted from the league. What do the guys good enough he should be on a team but he had like one good season and then he was exposed just like RG 3 and a number of other quarterbacks. Then he didn't take his trial seriously.</p><p>And you look at quarterbacks like Jamey Winston who threw for like over 5000 yards last season but also a lot of interceptions and that guy can't get a starting job in the league. He's a backup to Drew Brees so it's all about game play here. Teams want to win and that's what's most important and if he's good enough you should be on a team.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the President also weighed in on the kneeling controversy listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: When the National Anthem plays and our flag the great American flag is raised you should not be kneeling, you should be standing ideally with your hand on your heart or saluting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not changing his stance on that Steve Forbes.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: No he isn't. So I think he's a recognizing weather situation we have today as Dagen pointed out. And the fact that he can play a team is going to sign him, I guarantee of that. And so he will have a job coming this new season. And I think they will get that season off the ground.</p><p>But in terms of the anthem and everything else I think you're going to see a lot of the players doing the kneel whether it's the NHL, the NBA even - you may not have size and had baseball yet. I'm not sure we're going to have a season yet but that seems almost past say now given the situation we have today.</p><p>I think most fans are just going to look away and say I like it or don't like it. But they're going to be focusing on issues like the upcoming police reform bill that the GOP is introducing the Senator Scott and try to get substantive things done so that these other controversies won't be necessary because real reforms is being undertaken.</p><p>And that's the key real action if not just having to rely on symbols but getting real things done especially in getting police transparency with the unions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I think that's what the White House is trying to do as well? Some real changes actually. I will - we'll be talking about that coming up. Then also coming up Americans are eager to get back to work but certain states are seeing a record spike in new Coronavirus cases after rolling back restrictions what it could mean for recovery coming up?</p><p>Plus a rearranged marriage how brides and grooms are reshaping their traditional wedding plans amid the Coronavirus pandemic? We wish you hear this, stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, June 18th. Your top stories right now, it is 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. There are concerns growing over coronavirus spike as the country reopens. Florida, Texas, Arizona are all seeing cases rise to record highs. Futures meanwhile are searching for direction this morning.</p><p>Take a look at stocks, the Dow is down 24, the Nasdaq is up, it's up at 8 points and the S&amp;P is down 2 and a half. Similar story yesterday when the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 snapped a three-day winning streak, but the Nasdaq was actually higher at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. The Dow is down 170 points with the Nasdaq was up 14, the S&amp;P was down 11 at the close yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this, European indices right now are lower across the board, we are waiting on the Bank of England's decision today at 7:00 a.m. Eastern, investors are looking for an expansion of its bond-buying program, and any news of any possible stimulus for England. The FTSE 100 right now is down about -- under 1 point, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 20, and the Dax index in Germany lower by 26.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets are mostly lower there as well. Chinese Center for Disease Control is claiming that the latest coronavirus outbreak in Beijing is under control, nonetheless, we told you last -- yesterday, rather, that the entire city is being closed in terms of schools, et cetera. Shanghai Composite was up a fraction, the others were lower. Hertz is slamming the brakes on a proposed sale of New York -- of new stock. Cheryl Casone with the details there. They were going to do a secondary, right, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, Maria, and this is a company -- let's remind everybody, that's in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. So this raises a lot of eyebrows. Now, Hertz has suspended that plan to sell up to $500 million in new shares after the Securities and Exchange Commission raised questions about the deal, Hertz was looking to take advantage of a recent rally in its stock which sent shares as high as 553 each.</p><p>Investors piled into the stock even after the company warned these new shares could be worthless. Hertz was forced to idle about 700,000 vehicles because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There's the stock in the pre-market, back down to a buck 81, a loss of 9.5 percent in the premarket -- and by the way, the stock was halted for several hours yesterday. Well, Conagra brands says it's going to do a complete brand and packaging review of Mrs. Butterworth's syrups after the Quaker Oats company announced plans to retire its Aunt Jemima brand because it is based on racial stereotypes and doesn't represent company values.</p><p>But they're not the only logic corporation making changes, Mars' own Uncle Ben is also changing its look. The company is telling Fox Business, it doesn't plan on replacing the products, but they're going to focus on evolving the Uncle Ben's brand. Finally, let us look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, AT&amp;T's 5G network is expected to reach nationwide coverage this Summer.</p><p>Currently, it covers more than 160 million people and 327 markets. Lyft pledging every vehicle in its platform is going to be electric by 2030, but it's not providing financial support to drivers to make the switch. And for today only, Blaze Pizza, Maria, it's offering its pizza with a mango- flavored white claw hard seltzer crust at 40 of its locations.</p><p>This by the way is LeBron James' pizza company. I know you're a pizza purist, so I don't know how you feel about that, but that's what they're going to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I like all small businesses to thrive, so there's that, but yes, I'm you know, I'm a purist, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Good to know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, record coronavirus spikes across the country, we are talking about thousands of new cases this week in Florida, Texas and Arizona, but none of the governors in those states pushing to shut down again after pushing for reopening. President Trump is touting the economic resurgence the country has seen since reopening. He talked on Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we had to turn it off, we would have lost millions of people, we did, we turned it off, and now we've started up again and we're going to have an amazing year next year. We're going to have a great third quarter. We just had the best job's numbers, the biggest job gain in history, and we just had the biggest retail sales numbers in history for the last month.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: Yes --</p><p>TRUMP: So we're starting up and it's going to be very strong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Toby Cosgrove. And Toby, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much --</p><p>TOBY COSGROVE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CLEVELAND CLINIC: Good morning, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: For being here this morning.</p><p>COSGROVE: Well, thank you, my pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what strikes you first -- I'm sorry, so what strikes you first about where we are in the coronavirus? I have your op-ed that you wrote a couple of months ago in terms of needing an army of healthcare workers. So I'm going to get to that in a moment. But anything so far in terms of this reopening and these spikes that we're seeing that strikes you?</p><p>COSGROVE: Well, Maria, I think where we have to understand that we're going to be living with this pandemic for a very long period of time, that you have to remember that there's only been one viral disease that's totally eliminated from the face of the earth, and that's smallpox, we have all the rest of them with us. So even if we can get a vaccination, we're still going to have to understand that this is a new disease that we're going to have to deal with for a long time. So it's changed our culture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so how do we deal with that? Just what we're doing in terms of the guidelines, masks, gloves, anything else that we should be doing, knowing that this is here for some time and a vaccine doesn't happen overnight?</p><p>COSGROVE: No, it certainly doesn't, but I think we also have to appreciate the fact that 80 percent of the deaths have been in people who are over 65 years of age, and if you're under 65 years of age, the risk of dying of COVID infection is about the same as your risk of getting in a car accident and driving to work in the morning. So it's really very low and particularly low amongst young children.</p><p>So, that's a fortunate thing for younger people. But we have to protect older people, and the way you protect them is -- you don't put them in large crowds, you wear masks, you don't have long periods together with people, and those are the things that protect people over time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's really one of the reasons Vice President Mike Pence wrote an op-ed this week saying that there's no second wave, he's touting efforts by the administration to expand testing and research. Pence is blaming the media for overshadowing efforts, writing, quote, \"the media has tried to scare the American people every step of the way and these grim predictions of a second wave are no different.</p><p>The truth is whatever the media says, our whole-of-America approach has been a success.\" What's your take on that, Toby, in terms of this potential second wave. You say, look, this is here with us, we've got to deal with it and we all have to adapt.</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes, exactly. And Dr. Fauci, I think made it very clear that we haven't got the second wave yet, we're continuing to see this first problem that we're dealing with, and we're going to continue to have to deal with it for a long time. One of the things that concerns me is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me talk to you about what you've -- yes, go ahead --</p><p>COSGROVE: One of the things that concerns me is 30 percent of the people said that they wouldn't get a vaccine initially, and that is going to leave a repository of infections that will continue to be with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. A lot of people refuse to get vaccines regardless and --</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Overall. You've been talking about this healthcare ready reserve trained by U.S. Armed Forces, so you write an op-ed on health soldiers saying that we could train 1 million people over 3 to 12 months on military bases for around $50 billion. You say that both of the problems can be solved at least partially in the same solution establishment of a million strong healthcare ready reserve. Tell us more about this.</p><p>COSGROVE: Well, I think this is an idea that John Dreskell(ph), a friend of mine came up with, and I thought it was a great idea, and basically is going back to WPA, what happened after the great depression? We're dealing with two things, frankly, we're dealing with a disease and we're dealing with unemployment. And this is an opportunity to train people that will be healthcare providers in the future.</p><p>This would be much like a National Guard is today to be called out, and it will provide employment, it will provide salaries and it will also benefit the country. And I think this is an opportunity that is bigger than just providing a straight financial aid to people, it gives them the dignity of a job and it provides additional support for the country to continue.</p><p>Think about contact-tracing for example, we don't have enough contact- tracers in many states, this would provide those sorts of individuals. And I think that you do have an opportunity to begin to develop a force that will begin to look at floods or hurricanes or any sort of natural disasters as well as epidemics in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love the idea. I think to me, it falls under the umbrella of national security. You know, it's almost like we --</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, the fact that we have to import 70 percent of the active ingredients in our drugs, that this is just not acceptable. I mean, this is, again, under national security, we need to have this -- the training as you say for a healthcare professionals as well as the drugs we need accessible and at-the ready. So have you shared this idea, Toby, with the administration?</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes, I have. I've shared it as lively as I can. There are senators now, Senator Sullivan from Alaska, for example, is starting to put together a bill in the Senate, and I hope that we will use some of the money that has been directed to -- for COVID to sort of an opportunity. I think it is going to be vital for unemployment and good for the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, Toby, real quick before you go, I know you've worked a lot on technology and technology enabling healthcare. Can you talk to us about any jobs that you see in the future in that realm?</p><p>COSGROVE: Yes, I think that we have to really begin to think about technology, helping us understand the opportunities there are from these huge data sets. And AI, and I think is going to be enormous opportunity to do that, and the use of the huge data sets that are being accumulated now through electronic medical records.</p><p>I think it's possible to have privacy and also use those -- that data to improve the quality of care for people and be great for predicting of disease propensity. This opportunity is to do this or enormous we're seeing all kinds of interesting ways now to begin to track the, you know, testing, using your cell phones and technologies. This is great opportunities and I think technology is going to explode.</p><p>One of the things that has taken off is through this whole epidemic is the use of telemedicine. Tele-medicine at the clinic went from 2 percent to 75 percent of the visits, over a two-month period --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow --</p><p>COSGROVE: Of time, 94 percent of diabetics were treated this way. I could imagine now that you're no longer going to need to go to the hospital to get your blood-sugar checked or your blood pressure taken, it all can be done from home and probably regulated much more efficiently than it ever has in the past. This is a whole new world that is opening up and how you treat patients, and I think people will be moving increasingly to outpatient and to homecare as a result of this. A major change that technology is bringing to the delivery of healthcare.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. I love it. It's a new day in that regard. Toby Cosgrove, it's always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>COSGROVE: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Toby Cosgrove, but we'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, wedding bell blues. The coronavirus pandemic forcing many couples to change their plans to their upcoming wedding. More couples are passing on the vows and just living the together. As our Gerri Willis reports, there are benefits on both sides of that aisle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, TELEVISION JOURNALIST: It's June and usually that means wedding season, but this year, thousands of couples have postponed because of COVID-19. But for now, they're in good company when it comes to staying committed without getting hitched. Millions of committed couples choose never to get married in the first place. Listen to my friend Jeane Meyer on why she decided not to tie the knot.</p><p>JEANE MEYER, MARKETING CONSULTANT: Both of us had short-term marriages that ended in divorce, and I think the primary reason is that the divorce in particular was a very unpleasant process -- you know, it wasn't our first rodeo.</p><p>WILLIS: The percentage of partners who don't get married has tripled in the last two decades. Marriage rates are at their lowest level in over 100 years and the trend is gaining steam with Gen Z couples 24 and under more likely to live together than be married. But experts say what's love got to do with it? There are more than a thousand tax breaks, benefits and protections for married couples like tax benefits, employee benefits, even housing benefits.</p><p>MARILYN CHINITZ, PARTNER, BLANK ROME LLP: So there's very significant reasons I think that you want to take advantage of the marital laws because it provides you with the opportunity to enhance and preserve that wealth which is very important for most people.</p><p>WILLIS: Primary amongst those benefits inheriting your spouse's assets when they pass away without paying any federal or estate taxes. In fact, spouses can exchange financial gifts completely tax-free. So with so many financial benefits on the table, why choose not to marry?</p><p>CHINITZ: Well, you maintain your own assets, you maintain your own wealth, and there are clearly benefits to being single because number one, you maintain your financial autonomy, no one is telling you what to do.</p><p>WILLIS: The number of older couples who get together but don't marry has tripled over the last two decades, the reason? Social security. Getting hitched can reduce benefits significantly. Also marriage can threaten the inheritance for any children from previous relationships. That said, committed couples who aren't married can tackle those issues with contracts and wills. As for Jeane, she says she only has one regret.</p><p>MEYER: Because we never had an official wedding date, we don't really celebrate an anniversary. Every now and then, I think, it would be nice to have an actual wedding anniversary.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: Maria, for me, I made my decision years ago last week, I celebrated my 26th wedding anniversary. So far, it's working out. Back to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How fantastic, thank you, Gerri. And I just celebrated 21, more MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the morning buzz. First up, Spotify brings to star power to its podcast roster. Kim Kardashian, West inking a new deal for an exclusive series on a case involving criminal justice reform. Mark Tepper, will you tune in?</p><p>MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, actually, I mean, look, Spotify right now, they seem to be the big winner in the podcast war. I mean, they landed Joe Rogan, maybe a month ago, and now they got Kim K. And the deal is this, I mean, Joe Rogan became disgruntled with YouTube and their censorship. I mean, you know, we all know that Google right now has the federal list than zero had in its crosshair.</p><p>So censorship is a big issue. You know, you're supposed to be able to say what you want on a podcast, and then people have the choice to listen or not. So, I think Spotify is definitely going to be the big winner here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting. Next up here are the tweets. Twitter trying out audio tweets now where users can now share thoughts in audio form. Dagen?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: So if Kim Kardashian tweets, fam, I wonder what it's going to sound like as she does on audio tweets because again, who wants to listen to a podcast? Listening to that valley girl voice for any -- longer than 15 seconds. So audio tweets -- I just wonder if people will be as nasty if they audio tweet you as they are on Twitter was in responding to things that you might say because like there is so much venom and vile out there, I think folks need to go to church.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and if you start just saying it, maybe you're doing too many knee-jerk reactions in an audio tweet. How about this? Not so fast. A new study shows half of Americans are not quite ready to go back to the office yet due to concerns over health and safety. The same study shows 40 percent of Americans have bosses who are not forcing them to come back, Steve, what do you think?</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, that's changed, and I think, you will have people coming back more as we get effective treatments and later this year we get a vaccine. But in terms of interaction with people, I think there's no substitute for that. Yes, you can get a lot of work done at home, perhaps more work if the kids stay out of the way or grandkids stay out of the way.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is offices are being reconfigured. We're doing the same thing that our offices will be opening in a few weeks. And people want safety, but they do need that interaction. So you might call up masking anxieties, you put the mask on and I think people will interact. This is not going to be a permanent. It will be a mix. It'll be a mix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, still ahead, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is here this morning as Democrats and Republicans clash over what to include in police reform legislation. He's right here next hour with MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020061801cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-JSB1-JB20-G3MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

While Congress obsesses about new ways to regulate \"big tech,\" the US government has oddly been busy neutering all oversight of \"big telecom\"[4]. That's at least partially by design; giants like AT...nd Comcast have spent years[5] pushing for the hyper regulation of companies telecom increasingly competes with in the online ad space. The result: as Silicon Valley faces an endless cavalcade of daily DC and press outrage, the telecom sector has suddenly little to no scrutiny whatsoever. Whether it's the speed at which the competition-eroding T-Mobile merger is being shoveled through the DOJ and FCC[6], or the blind eye being turned to major telecom privacy scandals[7] (like location data), telecom lobbyists have been on a successful tear convincing well-heeled DC lawmakers to ignore the massive, obvious monopoly, privacy, and competition issues inherent in telecom to focus exclusively on the problems in \"big tech.\" </p><p>AT... top lobbying and policy man, Jim Cicconi, was recently brought out of retirement[8] to (in part) help tackle both the looming privacy minefield and an ongoing revolt among investors who have grown tired of AT... focus on growth for growth's sake[9]. In a treatise nobody asked for[10], Cicconi this week shared his thoughts[11] on recent missives at the NY Times[12] exploring how the bloom of optimism has fallen from the internet rose in recent years. The Times package focuses on everything from US broadband coverage woes to the rise of internet misinformation. But Cecconi's takeaway from the package, unsurprisingly, is somehow that broadband providers are yesterday's news and no longer worth talking about:\"Notably, nowhere does the series discuss internet service provider (ISP)-based open internet misconduct or concerns, and for good reason. As intervening events in the last few years have dramatically exposed how the internet is being used, misused and manipulated by a variety of internet players, ISP-centric arguments have quickly become yesterday's policy story.\"This idea that the hugely unpopular telecom sector is an innocent little angel and Silicon Valley is the only real problem has been a narrative telecom giants have been pushing for a while[13], and with pretty notable success if you've tracked DC policy conversations and the newswires. But because the Times didn't bother mentioning how telecom is nearly as terrible[14] on privacy as Facebook, doesn't make it untrue. Of course Cicconi and AT... real goal is to ensure that whatever regulation and legislation comes from this era of reckoning, it won't include big telecom:\"Yet for the past decade plus, the internet policy debate has been focused almost solely on ISPs, to the exclusion of other online actors. That regulatory myopia has in turn produced the internet we didn't expect. The true costs and challenges of an interconnected world, which are now only starting to be more fully understood, are the issues that today demand our time, energy and best ideas. As we look back on the debate, I hope that the signs and signals we missed previously will illuminate our path forward.\"That's total fantasy. The telecom sector has spent billions of dollars to eliminate consumer protections and government oversight of its businesses over the last few decades. That recently culminated in the FCC's decision to effectively self-immolate[15] at industry's behest, shoveling any remaining telecom oversight to an FTC that lacks the authority or resources[16] to police the sector effectively. The end result: a total accountability vacuum that's letting the telecom sector rip off customers with relative impunity, provided they're moderately clever about it[17]. Our friend Jim is worried about one thing: that Congress and the states will ruin AT... string of good luck with new laws and regulation focused on subjects like privacy and an open internet. And he'd sure appreciate it if the most unpopular business sector in America, fresh on the heels of thirty years of anticompetitive behavior, is excluded entirely from the conversation.Permalink[18] |

The Department of Justice sued to block AT... merger late last year as part of a move that surprised most analysts and even the wireless carrier itself, prompting it to delay its deadline for the completion of the deal while publicly expressing its befuddlement[1] with the development. </p><p>And while the antitrust regulator is trying to break more than a century old precedent in regards to vertical consolidations, big tech is still freely investing in the segment, with the likes of Amazon, Netflix, Google, and even Facebook now committing significant sums to original video content. Leo Hindery of InterMedia Partners was quoted by CNBC as saying that this is the first period in his career over which he's reluctant to predict what kind of a reaction could the federal regulators have to any proposed mergers, vertical or otherwise, criticizing Washington's 'inconsistent strategies' in regards to approaching big business tie-ups. Whereas the Silicon Valley is still committing billions to boosting its video programming, some traditional media players feel they are unfairly limited by antitrust regulations, with that gap in regulatory policies becoming even more pronounced after the DOJ decided to break from precedent and challenge AT... proposal in court. That state of affairs is also what partially prompted Rupert Murdoch to accept Disney's $52.4 billion bid for the majority of 21st Century Fox last month, some sources claim. The high-profile deal may not be as straightforward as originally announced, with Comcast supposedly considering outbidding Disney for the assets if AT...] succeeds in defending its proposed acquisition in the court of law, though Disney is understood to already be planning for such a scenario. Mr. Murdoch recently publicly criticized social media companies for their role in the demise of not just traditional media but digital outlets as well, claiming companies like Facebook should pay[3] any website whose content their users are taking. The media mogul is understood to be skeptical of Fox's long-term prospects as uneven regulatory pressure and other obstacles may allow the Silicon Valley to outbid the firm for valuable content in the future, making Disney's offer an apt opportunity for him to cash out.

Stankey went on to single out the CEO of the world's largest social-networking service.</p><p>\"I heard some comments the other day that Mark Zuckerberg made that said he thinks he's somewhere between a distribution company like a telephone company and a media company, and therefore they should be handled differently,\" Stankey said. \"And I kind of said, you know, why did editorial integrity show up in media companies? ... Well, editorial integrity and editors arrived because people needed to make sure that their source of information was, in fact, doing that ethical and fair reporting.\"</p><p>Stankey had earlier referenced the news efforts at CNN in the interview.</p><p>Stankey raised concerns about the tech companies as they come under growing scrutiny about how they use personal information and provide information to the masses.

I, of course, cannot do that!\"Leon's opinion repeatedly cites the challenges facing traditional media conglomerates amid the rise of <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>Amazon, Facebook, and other hugely capitalized digital behemoths. The judge offers lengthy discourse on how the digital heavyweights are advantaged by the Big Data they cull from the viewing activity on their platforms. He also discusses the unique structure of the SVOD giants in serving as both a distributor with direct customer relationships and a programming service offering exclusive original series. Even in a vertically integrated media conglomerate such as Comcast, the cable service and programming operations are usually separated by distinct divisions. <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>on the other hand, is an all-in-one service that has direct relationships with subscribers but at a much lower cost than traditional MVPD service.Leon notes the hyper-competitive impact of <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>barreling into the programming arena with as much as $8 billion to spend on original and acquired content, which as he cites in the opinion \"is more than twice the size of HBO's\" programming budget. He also points to the shift in consumer behavior toward preferring ad-free platforms.\"After all, as Nobel Laureate\u00a0Bob Dylan correctly observed: You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,\" Leon wrote, quoting a lyric from Dylan's 1965 anthem \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" Moreover, he rejects the government's rationale that the market power of a combined AT&amp;T-Time Warner needed to be considered outside of the context of the larger pay-TV market, echoing the assertions of CEOs and moguls for more than a decade. Leon's legal reasoning will undoubtedly be cited by companies in future regulatory proceedings at the FCC and Justice Department.\"Although the government is of course correct that the refrain 'we are getting killed in by new competition in different markets' is no 'defense to an illegal merger,' I simply cannot evaluate the government's theories and predictions of harm, as presented by the Government at trial, without factoring in the dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers view video content.\"The judge's opinion was so strongly in favor of AT&amp;T that he went so far as to endorse the telco giant's projection of realizing $1.5 billion in cost savings by 2021 from the consolidation of overlapping administrative departments. \"I have a high degree of confidence that the defendants will generate most, if not all, of the predicted $1.5 billion in annual cost savings,\" he wrote.Leon's opinion took an exhaustive look at the facts and theories traded in the AT&amp;T case no doubt because he is aware of its impact on future media M&amp;A activity at this tumultuous time of disruption and reinvention. He notes that the trial generated some 3,000 pages of documents, and that the transcript of the court proceedings over the six-week trial runs some 4,300-pages.He concluded his opus opinion with a warning that the government should not take any more steps to block the completion of AT&amp;T and Time Warner deal, now scheduled for June 20. For the government to seek a stay of his order pending their appeal would do far more harm than good, even for those in the Justice Department who strongly believe that the deal is bad for competition.\"To use a stay to accomplish indirectly what could not be done directly - especially when it would cause certain irreparable harm to the defendants - simply would be unjust. I hope and trust that the government will have the good judgment, wisdom, and courage to avoid such a manifest injustice,\" Leon wrote. \"To do otherwise, I fear, would undermine the faith in our system of justice of not only the defendants, but their millions of shareholders and the business community at large.\"Read the full ruling below:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/381649278/AT-T-Decision#from_embed\">AT&amp;T Decision</url> by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/user/70135302/gmaddaus#from_embed\">gmaddaus</url> on ScribdRelated stories      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/att-time-warner-trump-1202844093/\">Time Warner: Political 'Motivation' Was Behind Antitrust Lawsuit</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/att-time-warner-merger-decision-hollywood-reacts-1202843539/\">AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger Decision Inspires Mixed Emotions in Hollywood</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-decision-time-warner-ma-content-technology-1202843249/\">AT&amp;T Decision Could Send Content Companies Rushing Into Big Tech's Arms</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1202843576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJB-3041-DYJW-X2T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

Across Hollywood, the talk was almost exclusively about the pending federal court ruling on <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/att/\">AT&amp;T</url>'s $85 billion bid for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/time-warner/\">Time Warner</url>, the company behind Warner Bros., HBO, and CNN.Work screeched to a halt Tuesday afternoon on Warner Bros.'s Burbank lot and in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-time-warner-trial-streaming-cord-cutting-1202843576/\">Time Warner</url>'s sprawling mid-town Manhattan office complex as employees gathered around televisions, scrolled through Twitter, and kept checking their phones for updates.There was a palpable sense of relief and even some scattered applause, insiders said, when word finally came that U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon had upheld the merger. Employees on both coasts were largely relieved by the sweeping nature of Leon's decision. The judge rejected the Justice Department's lawsuit claiming that the marriage of the telecom giant and the entertainment company represented an anti-trust violation and imposed no conditions on the merger.\"We've been in a holding pattern for so long,\" said one Time Warner employee. \"At least now we have some clarity.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/att-time-warner-trump-1202844093/\">AT&amp;T</url> presented the deal as a win for consumers, saying the merger means \"we can begin to give consumers video entertainment that is more affordable, mobile, and innovative.\" But most industry observers think the big winners will be corporate lawyers, bankers, and moguls, all of whom are poised to benefit from a coming wave of media consolidation.\"It's not the summer of love,\" said one studio executive. \"It's the summer of chaos.\"Comcast, emboldened by the judge's rubber stamping of the AT&amp;T/Time Warner deal, is expected to formally make an offer on Wednesday for most of Fox's film and television assets. The cable giant hopes to play spoiler, potentially plucking Fox away from the Walt Disney Company, which has a deal to buy the bulk of the company. At the very least Comcast will drive the price for Fox above the $52.4 billion in stock that Disney is currently offering.Many industry figures believe that the AT&amp;T and Time Warner deal will have a domino effect, potentially putting companies like Lionsgate, MGM, or Sony in play as bigger companies hope to capitalize on a more laissez-faire regulatory climate.\"It's off to the races,\" said one entertainment industry executive. \"Whether you're Apple or Amazon or someone with a big wad of cash, this gives you the greenlight to go shopping.\"That's a good thing for tech giants looking to buy content makers, but it's a bad thing for job security. There's already a lot of uncertainty on the Fox lot, where executives were busy mapping out their post-Disney plans - Some were thrilled to have received the silent nod they'd be part of the Magic Kingdom, others were aggrieved to have realized that Bob Iger's team had little need for them, and a more entrepreneurial group were already mapping out new landing spots. The entrance of Comcast complicates that kind of long-term strategizing.Those concerns extend beyond the Fox rank-and-file.\"There have been lots of questions by talent who wonder should I make a movie or a show there?\" said the industry executive. \"They don't know who is going to be in control.\"There are a few contrarians who believe it's hyperbolic to think the AT&amp;T and Time Warner deal will open the floodgates on merger activity.\"I don't buy the theory this is going to change the world,\" said Richard Gelfond, CEO of IMAX. \"Some things that were in the works for awhile will happen now, but I don't think there's going to be dozens of transactions.\"Entertainment industry labor unions voiced anger over the court's decision. The Writers Guild of America, East, for instance, released a blistering statement linking the AT&amp;T and Time Warner decision with recent efforts to weaken net neutrality protections.\"Never before has so much programming been under the domination of so few massive media and technology corporations,\" the guild's statement reads. \"At a time when the country demands, and needs, the broadest possible set of views and stories and voices, we have handed over the keys to the media kingdom to giants whose sole motivation is to maximize their short-term investment return, not to inform or enlighten or entertain. Monopolies and oligopolies are bad for the economy in general, and for people who care about compelling stories and insightful reporting, in particular.\"The Writers Guild of America, West echoed its cousin to the East, noting that it had supported the Justice Department's effort to squelch the AT&amp;T-Time Warner union.\"A combined AT&amp;T-Time Warner, like so many mergers before it, will lead to higher prices and fewer choices,\" the group said in a statement. \"Further, it will pave the way for more anti-competitive mega-mergers, like the forthcoming Comcast-NBCU-Fox tie-up.\"IMAX's Gelfond disagrees. He argues the Justice Department was using an overly broad definition of monopolies\"The media landscape is changing so rapidly that it would have messed up the business if this had been allowed to go through,\" said Gelfond. \"Today's decision is good for the industry, and it's good for the country.\"Related stories      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/att-time-warner-trump-1202844093/\">Time Warner: Political 'Motivation' Was Behind Antitrust Lawsuit</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/att-time-warner-merger-decision-hollywood-reacts-1202843539/\">AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger Decision Inspires Mixed Emotions in Hollywood</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-decision-time-warner-ma-content-technology-1202843249/\">AT&amp;T Decision Could Send Content Companies Rushing Into Big Tech's Arms</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1202843539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJB-3041-DYJW-X2TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 12, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002SBL</classCode><className>TIME WARNER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

That Verizon, Comcast and Sony all seemingly were interested in Fox shows there's sizable interest in M&amp;A, and \"a lot of assets on the block,\" he said.</p><p>Also driving such activity in the coming year is the expectation the regulatory environment is amenable, despite the DOJ challenge to AT&amp;T/TW (see 1711210005), experts said. AT&amp;T/TW and Disney/Fox were driven in part by that regulatory perception, plus that both are in maturing spaces that lead to players looking for increased scale via M&amp;A, said S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Research Director-Media Ian Olgeirson. But whether the regulatory environment is friendlier \"remains a question mark,\" Olgeirson said.</p><p>Some see the trend of MVPD consolidation losing steam. TV industry analyst Alan Wolk said the looming arrival of 5G and its potential for rivaling home broadband could make MVPDs less attractive as an investment. But as the broadband market continues maturing, there could be more willing cable ISP sellers as they see broadband start to face an uphill battle, Olgeirson said. He also said 5G's introduction \"is a double-edged sword\" for cable operators, with competing high-bandwidth high-throughput wireless service posing a competitive challenge to wireline operators, but 5G also requiring a dense last-mile infrastructure to serve small cells. Small and mid-sized cable ISPs are seeing \"a lot of speculation\" about whether it's a good time to combine, given 5G issues, said American Cable Association President Matt Polka.</p><p>AT&amp;T/TW will likely be consummated next year with a settlement just before the March trial, while Disney/Fox \"breeze[s]\" through regulatory approval, said tech and media investor Eric Jackson, president of EMJ Capital, in a newsletter Wednesday. He predicted an \"M&amp;A bonanza\" next year, with the market slightly sour on initial public offerings, saying that bonanza will include \"more mega-mergers and ... some of the smaller media companies ... to be digested by their larger siblings.\" Other deals potentially in the wings include Verizon/CBS, since CBS has no partnership for its content and no way to distribute internationally, Wolk said. CBS and Verizon didn't comment.</p><p>Wolk also said 2018 will bring more virtual MVPD services, as they let providers introduce both targeted advertising and easier upgrades of interfaces than traditional MVPDs can accomplish.</p><p>The increased recognition in the past three to four years that viewers want more watching options led channels that once eschewed Internet distribution to jump to virtual MVPD lineups, said University of Michigan communications studies professor Amanda Lotz. That's been an impetus for some deals, like Disney/Fox, but smaller programmers remain unlikely to go the DTC route since sticking with a streaming service partner \"takes a whole lot of headaches off the table,\" Lotz said. Given the technical difficulties of having a robust over-the-top (OTT) service, a more significant deal for Disney might have been its acquiring a majority of streaming tech company BAMTech (see 1708080065), she said.</p><p>The FCC's rollback of Title II regulation of broadband could sizably affect media mergers, Lotz said, with distributor and programmer relationships in the future depending on the degree to which cable ISPs engage in paid prioritization and use exclusive content deals as a selling feature. The net neutrality rollback creates the new balance of power that cable ISPs have long wanted, but content companies are in a more precarious position and more prone to look for deals with distributors, Lotz said. The new net neutrality regulatory policy \"has the potential to change everything in video distribution,\" she said. James said it's not clear how the new net neutrality regime will affect the video industry, but ISPs like Comcast or AT&amp;T likely won't want to be overly aggressive in favoring their own content or services, thus bringing scrutiny that could give cause for more regulation. \"No one wants to poke the bear on this one,\" James said.</p><p>The OTT industry is still some time away from M&amp;A deals, experts said. Streaming services are still figuring out their long-term viability, Wolk said. More likely than acquisitions are partnerships and bundles of complementary services, James said, citing Hulu and Spotify rolling out a combined offering for college students. For now, most of the existing streaming services have relatively small subscriber bases, meaning \"there's not a lot to buy there,\" Olgeirson said.</p><p>The M&amp;A thoughts of edge providers like Apple, Google and Facebook -- all of which undoubtedly will get deeper into video -- remain unclear, James said. The $1 billion Apple plans to spend on original content \"is not that big\" compared with what Netflix and Amazon Prime are spending, he said, saying shopping for an MVPD might be on hold until prices come down. The \"perpetual buzz\" of one of the tech companies getting into distribution has been \"more noise than truth,\" and remains unlikely, Olgeirson said. Wolk said he sees the possibility of a major edge provider like Apple buying an MVPD or telco to get a last-mile distribution platform, plus more access to user data. Big tech companies \"have more money than God,\" he said, saying with Apple, the question of a major investment into content, such as through buying a programmer, is \"when and what, rather than if.\" Apple didn't comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R9M-RWK1-JC8G-92B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 02, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC00028PO</classCode><className>BAIN &amp;

That Verizon, Comcast and Sony all seemingly were interested in Fox shows there's sizable interest in M&amp;A, and \"a lot of assets on the block,\" he said.</p><p>Also driving such activity in the coming year is the expectation the regulatory environment is amenable, despite the DOJ challenge to AT&amp;T/TW (see 1711210005), experts said. AT&amp;T/TW and Disney/Fox were driven in part by that regulatory perception, plus that both are in maturing spaces that lead to players looking for increased scale via M&amp;A, said S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Research Director-Media Ian Olgeirson. But whether the regulatory environment is friendlier \"remains a question mark,\" Olgeirson said.</p><p>Some see the trend of MVPD consolidation losing steam. TV industry analyst Alan Wolk said the looming arrival of 5G and its potential for rivaling home broadband could make MVPDs less attractive as an investment. But as the broadband market continues maturing, there could be more willing cable ISP sellers as they see broadband start to face an uphill battle, Olgeirson said. He also said 5G's introduction \"is a double-edged sword\" for cable operators, with competing high-bandwidth high-throughput wireless service posing a competitive challenge to wireline operators, but 5G also requiring a dense last-mile infrastructure to serve small cells.

Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, immediately sought to vet AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson's predictions of lower prices, but also questioned deal opponent Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge. The $108.7 billion deal was announced in October and the nearly three-hour hearing was the first on its merits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stephenson assured Lee the takeover would lead to lower prices \"by virtue of the innovation,\" as it did with his company's recent buy of DirecTV. The TW acquisition \"is taking the innovation of DirecTV Now to a whole different place and a whole different level,\" he said, referring to the recently launched streaming service (see 1612060065). He committed to subcommittee ranking member Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that the combined company wouldn't discriminate against non-TW content: \"There's no advantage to it, nor would we do it.\" DOJ should \"formulate an approach\" ensuring AT&amp;T abides by certain promises, Stephenson said. Klobuchar mentioned \"growing skepticism\" that conditions can be truly effective. Justice doesn't have the engineers and network experts to really assess, Kimmelman told Klobuchar.</p><p>TW CEO Jeff Bewkes testified the combined company would have neither incentive nor ability to use increased leverage on carriage negotiation nor the financial incentive to use it for its benefit. \"It would make no sense ... to not sell HBO on the Comcast cable system, on the Verizon system,\" Bewkes said of that TW premium channel. \"It would make no sense not to offer it.\" He disputed the company would charge more: \"The market's way too competitive for that kind of thing.\"</p><p>Congress has no direct power in approving the transaction. Justice would review it but it's unclear if the FCC would have a role (see 1612060051). President-elect Donald Trump pledged in October that his administration would reject the deal. AT&amp;T is widely seen as a lobbying heavyweight and in the 2016 cycle AT&amp;T's federal political action committee donated thousands of dollars each to Lee, Klobuchar and the full Judiciary committee leadership plus multiple senators who defended the deal.</p><p>\"I would like to see the FCC involved in this,\" said Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., referring to what he saw as an important FCC role in addressing Comcast/NBCUniversal issues following that acquisition.</p><p>\"We're working through that process right now, senator,\" Stephenson told Franken. \"The trigger for FCC review is whether we assume any licenses from Time Warner.\" AT&amp;T is assessing \"license by license\" now and can't speak to whether it would file for commission review until it's finished, but it will \"keep the FCC posted on our process whether we file for formal review or not,\" Stephenson said. Kimmelman said the FCC's oversight would depend on \"what assets are involved in the transaction\" but would prefer a role: \"It would be beneficial to the public policy process.\"</p><p>Telecom Implications</p><p>Lee questioned witnesses on whether TW's business would become exempt from Section 5 of the FTC Act given the agency's common carrier exemption. \"They would come under the FCC's purview, in terms of regulating these issues,\" Stephenson told Lee, acknowledging \"confusion about a content company under the purview of the FCC\" and urging Congress bring \"some clarity\" through legislation. \"Obviously with the net neutrality provisions, our privacy standards are under the purview of the FCC,\" he said. The FTC's exemption applied to TW \"would be a cause of concern\" for some, Lee warned.</p><p>\"The FCC can only regulate their common carriage business,\" Kimmelman said. \"They are restricted by Congress. ... There is a gap there that I think is significant.\" He referred to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that the FTC lacks jurisdiction over AT&amp;T in a data throttling case: \"We believe the court decision was horrible and needs to be appealed.\"</p><p>Both Lee and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, identified zero rating among possible deal concerns. Grassley complained of personally struggling to find a favorite DirecTV channel and failing due to a contract dispute. \"There's concern that a combined company will give preferential treatment -- for example, favorable channel placement and zero rating pricing -- to Time Warner's premium entertainment programming to the disadvantage of other content producers, in particular small independent producers,\" Grassley warned. \"AT&amp;T's ownership of these channels could also potentially force DirecTV's rivals into a Hobson's choice of higher prices or limited Time Warner content, knowing that many customers would migrate to DirecTV if its rivals refuse to pay the higher Time Warner prices,\" Lee said in his opening statement, noting \"potential anticompetitive favoritism.\" He invoked \"the siren song of zero rating,\" which he said \"appears to be consumer friendly\" but noted its critics, including the FCC's recent concern on AT&amp;T practices: \"Critics say that such concerns would only be exacerbated if AT&amp;T were able to bring Time Warner content under its fold.\"</p><p>\"It'll combine two titans of industry,\" said Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., worrying about the loss of net neutrality protections in light of such a change. Those rules \"appear to be under serious threat by the incoming administration,\" Leahy said, saying Trump has \"formally named three staunch net neutrality opponents to oversee his FCC transition.\" Harms \"would only be exacerbated\" by further consolidation, Leahy said. Franken pressed Stephenson to attempt to stop Trump and Congress from rolling back net neutrality. \"I am not a strong opponent of net neutrality,\" Stephenson replied, saying AT&amp;T \"supported\" and \"helped craft\" the previous 2010 net neutrality rules. \"We went to court against Title II categorization of our services; that is not synonymous with net neutrality.\"</p><p>\"I have yet to be convinced the benefits outweigh the harms to competition and possibly to consumers,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., ripping into Trump's unhappiness with TW's CNN news coverage as a factor in his opposition to the deal: \"For a public official to use the blunt heavy instrument of law enforcement to try to silence or change coverage by a news department of any company is for me absolutely abhorrent.\" Stephenson and Bewkes defended their commitment to independent journalism and pledged coverage wouldn't be influenced. \"I'm a novice in the world of politics,\" Stephenson told Blumenthal.</p><p>GOP Support</p><p>Several Republican senators struck a sympathetic note, pressing the CEOs to elucidate benefits. \"We have to consider who the competition really is,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., citing power \"among the edge providers.\" Stephenson said the combined company is necessary to take on cable incumbents. \"How does this size of the merged company compare to the real competitors we're talking about, some of the edge companies?\" Flake asked.</p><p>\"The combined market cap, depending on the day you look at the market, is 300, 350 billion,\" while some of the big tech companies \"are about two times that size,\" Stephenson said. \"We have to recalibrate what size means in this new world.\"</p><p>\"Size today does not necessarily correlate to dominance,\" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., considering that the deal may be necessary for innovation. \"I think this merger opens those doors.\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, prompted Stephenson on why it wouldn't make sense for AT&amp;T to raise prices and freeze out competitors and to \"degrade service speeds for nonaffiliated content.\" Stephenson said he sees no economic or customer rationale.</p><p>\"If we just continue to focus on where the puck is, not on where the puck is going,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., \"we're going to disadvantage some real innovators.\" He complained of \"constraints\" imposed \"using old-world models.\" Kimmelman agreed companies \"will skate to where the puck is\" and want to \"control as much of that distribution as possible.\" A lot of the new market players aren't charging $200 a month for access to content, he said: \"Somebody's paying, and I just want to make sure it's a fair price.\" The internet-focused tech entrants to the market don't control the wired and wireless access to households, he said: \"And you can probably only get it from a couple players, and that's where there's an antitrust problem.\" Franken said the puck is going in the direction of wireless. \"I'm hoping we're going to have a hearing [in 2017] on some of these broader communications issues next year,\" Klobuchar said of the big tech companies.</p><p>\"The present model needs disruption,\" Stephenson told senators. \"DirecTV Now is step one. Acquiring Time Warner is step two.\" He described a need for more flexible programming bundles, such as ones that don't involve sports.</p><p>The Consumer Federation of America released a 240-page report Wednesday blasting the influence of AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter Communications as a \"tight oligopoly on steroids.\" Written in conjunction with Public Knowledge, the report was mentioned by Klobuchar and Kimmelman during the hearing. CFA Research Director Mark Cooper wrote the document urging deal opposition and said \"there will still be a lot of work to do to control the abuse of market power by the dominant communication giants\" even with rejection. \"For a typical household with two wireless subscriptions, a [landline], broadband Internet access service, and multi-channel video, the total overcharge is about $45 per month ($540 per year),\" the report said. \"The aggregate overcharges are almost $60 billion per year.\"</p><p>RFD-TV CEO Patrick Gottsch issued a statement to the subcommittee saying he backs swift AT&amp;T/TW OK. He opposed the unsuccessful Comcast/Time Warner Cable, but AT&amp;T \"is honoring its commitment\" to rural America, Gottsch said. \"AT&amp;T's new DIRECTV NOW over-the-top service includes RFD-TV in its most basic package, which ensures that consumers across the country will have access to rural-oriented programming.\" Free Press didn't testify but slammed the deal: \"In the absence of strong antitrust enforcement and nondiscrimination rules, we know how AT&amp;T will use acquisitions like this,\" said Policy Director Matt Wood. \"It'll deny programming to other distributors and favor its own content -- slashing its own costs, but without passing any of those savings along to its customers.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MBK-W5S1-JC8G-831V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 08, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

In a blog post, AT&amp;T executive Joan Marsh said the telecom giant will participate in an FCC comment period later this week and will argue that platforms like Twitter and Facebook should be subject to clearer guidelines for how they handle controversial content on their platforms.  Marsh cast the fight over social media content moderation in light of the long-running debate over calls for \"net neutrality\" rules that would bar operators of physical broadband infrastructure, like AT&amp;T, from discriminating against content provided by their rivals or disfavored parties. Marsh said the discussion should now shift from targeting physical infrastructure to scrutinizing the web platforms where content actually is posted.  \"AT&amp;T will join the growing consensus of voices concluding that online platforms should be more accountable for, and more transparent about, the decisions they control,\" Marsh wrote. \"Dominant online platforms owe the public greater transparency about the choices made on their platforms.\"  The forthcoming comments relate to the White House's July 27 rulemaking request, which asked the FCC to consider whether it can further define the circumstances under which online content moderation policies constitute responsible practices. If companies do not follow reasonable moderation practices, they could be exposed to lawsuits under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Trump administration appeared motivated to act on the topic after Twitter labeled two of the president's posts about voting as misleading.  The FCC's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau published an Aug. 3 notice soliciting public input on the idea. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai acknowledged that the request is controversial but said in a statement that his agency takes the administration's petition seriously and is obligated to respond quickly.  AT&amp;T previously advocated for Pai's net neutrality deregulation, which in 2017 struck down rules requiring internet service providers to treat all content neutrally. Now, Marsh said, the agency is considering a more timely neutrality regime that would rightly shift the focus away from internet infrastructure to web platforms that actually control the flow of information.  \"The Section 230 debate and the broader tech scrutiny underway should serve as a reminder of where the power to control access to content, websites and e-services on the internet really resides,\" Marsh wrote. \"Adopting an ISP-only 'neutrality' regime is as backwards looking as it is mistargeted.\"  On the flip side, video-sharing service Vimeo has told the FCC that it should resist pressure from the White House to weaken the liability shield for social media sites. Vimeo, which was a vocal proponent of the now-discarded net neutrality regulations, wrote that the Section 230 probe is \"wildly inappropriate\" for the FCC as Congress already outlined.  According to the FCC, initial comments are due Wednesday, and reply comments are due by mid-September.  --Editing by Daniel King.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42971569727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-H331-JCSC-J17N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Law360</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

On one side are the bias-fixers, who believe the systems can be purged of prejudice with a bit more math. (Big Tech is largely in this camp.) On the other side are the bias-blockers, who argue that AI has no place at all in some high-stakes decisions.Why it matters: This debate will define the future of the controversial AI systems that help determine people's fates through hiring, underwriting, policing and bail-setting.What's happening: Despite the rise of the bias-blockers in 2019, the bias-fixers remain the orthodoxy. </p><p>A recent New York Times op-ed laid out the prevailing argument in its headline \"Biased algorithms are easier to fix than biased people[5].\"\"Discrimination by algorithm can be more readily discovered and more easily fixed,\" says UChicago professor Sendhil Mullainathan in the piece. Yann LeCun, Facebook's head of AI, tweeted approvingly: \"Bias in data can be fixed[6].\"But the op-ed was met with plenty of resistance. The other side: At the top academic conference for AI this week, Abeba Birhane of University College Dublin presented the opposing view[7]. Birhane's key point: \"This tool that I'm developing, is it even necessary in the first place?\"She gave classic examples of potentially dangerous algorithms, like one that claimed to determine a person's sexuality from a photo of their face, and another that tried to guess a person's ethnicity.\"[Bias] is not a problem we can solve with maths because the very idea of bias really needs much broader thinking,\" Birhane tells Axios. The big picture: In a recent essay, Frank Pasquale, a UMD law professor who studies AI, calls this a new wave of algorithmic accountability[8] that looks beyond technical fixes toward fundamental questions about economic and social inequality. \"There's definitely still resistance around it,\" says Rachel Thomas, a University of San Francisco professor. \"A lot of people are getting the message about bias but are not yet thinking about justice.\"\"This is uncomfortable for people who come up through computer science in academia, who spend most of their lives in the abstract world,\" says Emily M. Bender, a University of Washington professor. Bender argued in an essay last week that some technical research just shouldn't be done[9]. The bottom line: Technology can help root out some biases in AI systems. But this rising movement is pushing experts to look past the math to consider how their inventions will be used beyond the lab. \"AI researchers need to start from the beginning of the study to look at where algorithms are being applied on the ground,\" says Kate Crawford, co-founder of NYU's AI Now Institute.\"Rather than thinking about them as abstract technical problems, we have to see them as deep social interventions.\" The impact: Despite a flood of money and politics propelling AI forward, some researchers, companies and voters hit pause this year. Most visibly, campaigns to ban facial recognition technology succeeded in San Francisco[10], Oakland[11] and Somerville, Mass[12]. This week, nearby Brookline banned it, too[13].One potential outcome: freezes or restrictions on other controversial uses of AI. This scenario scares tech companies, who prefer to send plumbers in to repair buggy systems rather than to rip out the pipes entirely. But the question at the core of the debate is whether a fairness fix even exists.The swelling backlash says it doesn't \u2014especially when companies and researchers ask machines to do the impossible, like guess someone's emotions by analyzing facial expressions, or predict future crime based on skewed data. \"It's anti-scientific to imagine that an algorithm can solve a problem that humans can't,\" says Cathy O'Neil, an auditor of AI systems.These applications are \"AI snake oil,\" argues Princeton professor Arvind Narayanan in a presentation[14] that went viral on nerd Twitter recently.The main offenders are AI systems meant to predict social outcomes, like job performance or recidivism. \"These problems are hard because we can't predict the future,\" Narayanan writes. \"That should be common sense. But we seem to have decided to suspend common sense when AI is involved.\" This blowback's spark was a 2017 research project from MIT's Joy Buolamwini. She foundthat major facial recognition systems struggled to identify female and darker-toned faces. The study and its follow-ups prompted companies to try \"fixing\" the problem by increasing their systems' accuracy across faces \u2014mostly by gathering more data from underrepresented groups, sometimes in shady ways[15].But Buolamwini and others argue that the technology shouldn't be used[16] without being tightly regulated. What's next: Companies are tightening access to their AI algorithms[17], invoking intellectual property protections to avoid sharing details about how their systems arrive at critical decisions. \"The real problem is we citizens have no power to even examine or scrutinize these algorithms,\" says O'Neil. \"They're being used by private actors for commercial gain.\" [ 1]:

But 48 hours later - after blocks were removed on most of the app code - half a dozen tear down sites, cryptologists, cyber analysts and developers had broadly given the app a solid pass.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There have been some (serious) quibbles on how the Bluetooth goes to sleep on Apple phones, also anxiety about malicious actors sniffing the Bluetooth signal, and understandable concerns that the national data store creates a honey pot for hackers.

The COVIDSafe app is an important part of what public health officials expect to be a six-month highly structured return to normal living.</p><p>The speed of the spread of COVID-19 infections is what has caught dozens of countries off guard. Oxford University modelling shows contact tracing needs to happen in one or two days if it is going to be effective for isolating contacts - and that manual tracing will not be enough.</p><p>Australia's minuscule infection numbers mean that big state health tracing centres can use people power to run down the contacts quickly.</p><p>But this rapidly changes if you have a resurgence, exactly as Japan and Singapore experienced as they started to relax. Both were considered exemplars of the best pandemic practice.</p><p>And it's why Prime Minister Scott Morrison moved from being a sceptic to an enthusiastic promoter. Yesterday, he enthusiastically described the app as a \"ticket to a COVID-safe Australia\".</p><p>The tracing app is an integral part of the armoury and is why most developed countries are now exploring them in some form. This is being supported by both Google and Apple, who are due later this week to release beta seed code that should significantly improve the effectiveness of Bluetooth tracking apps, including Australia's.</p><p>The issue becomes adoption. Estimates vary, but to get a meaningful number of contacts, the maths suggests that more than half the community must download and turn on the COVIDSafe app.</p><p>Discounting for people without a smartphone, that is north of 10 million who need to turn on the app. The early adoption has been solid - about 3 million had downloaded the app by yesterday but there will need to be triple that uptake.</p><p>That is going to be an issue of public trust.</p><p>The anxiety among ministers and officials when they stepped up to the podium to launch the app on Sunday was palpable. And not surprising.</p><p>A litany of technology missteps has made the Commonwealth government everyone's favourite punching bag. The 24-hour shutdown of the 2016 Census site, the clumsy robo-debt implementation, the 2015 hack of the Bureau of Meteorology - and various small, but well-publicised, data leakages of Medicare and other data - had created an unshakable public narrative that Big Gov and its tech cannot be trusted.</p><p>At the same time, metadata capture, encryption legislation and pernicious prison sentences for digital giants that host abhorrent violent video were rushed into law. Poorly explained and with little regard to the precious social licence required, legislation was rammed through a mostly tech ignorant cabinet and Parliament. This led to loud charges of overreach.</p><p>Distrust with gov tech has also been fuelled by numerous usability, design and performance issues as (very) traditional government chief information officers struggled to grasp a digital world where citizen experience is king. Witness the tragic collapse of the MyGov site and the farcical ministerial attempts to blame it on hackers - only last month.</p><p>This collapse in digital trust has come as surging political partisanship and infighting and a federal public service that somewhere lost its mojo, have all combined to halve public trust in government over the past 20 years. Trust is now down to a miserable 26 per cent, with only one in three Australians trusting government services.</p><p>The elephant in the room is a deeply ingrained, 30-plus-year fear of privacy and identity issues, that started when the late Bob Hawke sensibly suggested a single identity card, called the Australia Card in the mid-1980s. The then Labor government lost a critical byelection over it.</p><p>Ever since generations of ministers and agency leaders have run scared of building a sensible trust framework to underpin the common sense joining up of services and data sharing to build better services and targeted policy initiatives.</p><p>This is finally being addressed, but meanwhile, Australia continues to play in the sandpit when it comes to privacy. Dog's breakfast is probably the best description of the mishmash of federal and state laws, regulations, codes and principles that describe the Australian privacy landscape. This is made more problematic because of special privacy provisions that apply in public health emergencies</p><p>In Australia, the lack of community consensus around privacy has severely hindered the roll-out of digital initiatives and data sharing more broadly.</p><p>This was the real world playing field when Morrison a month ago told Singapore's Prime Minister he was interested in its new tracing app. It set off a month-long scramble to try to reset the government's reputation for reliable, trust-worthy technology.</p><p>Five years ago it would have been laughable to even think the Commonwealth could get an app like the COVIDSafe live in a few weeks. The Digital Transformation Agency was set up for this exact purpose and leadership was determined to ensure the high-profile app was built with privacy and security at its core.</p><p>Working with Boston Consulting Group, local software engineer firm Shine Solutions and Amazon Web Services, the decision was taken to tightly limit the app to a single purpose, contact tracing, rather than a broader app that helped ensure social distancing. This meant no location data was needed.</p><p>Similarly, it was decided to collect only the minimum personal data needed for tracing. This materially reduced the risk of re-identification, an ever-present fear when collecting public data.</p><p>By limiting the amount of personal and sensitive information, this enabled the privacy policy and terms and conditions to be simplified and comprehended by a 14-year-old - unheard of in a typical government document.</p><p>By yesterday, the app had received more that 13,000 reviews, tracking at an impressive 4.3-star rating in the Apple App store and a solid 3.4 rating on Google's Play store.</p><p>It's still early days, but having learnt past lessons, the COVIDSafe app could finally be the turning point for digital services.AFR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7acrkl1zit3120fw9m9v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTB-YH21-JD34-V2CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1194\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They said Parker's experience is just one example.</p><p> Parker has been an advocate for gun control since his daughter, WDBJ (Channel 7) journalist Alison Parker, was shot to death on live television at Smith Mountain Lake in August 2015.</p><p> The gunman, a disgruntled former WDBJ news employee, filmed the shooting and posted it on social media shortly after killing Alison Parker and her colleague, Adam Ward, and wounding chamber of commerce official Vicki Gardner.</p><p> Videos from the gunman's point of view as well as what was filmed by WDBJ spread across social media platforms, especially on YouTube, whose parent company is Google. They've also spawned conspiracy theories, such as the shooting being faked as part of a plan to seize guns.</p><p> \"I recognize the First Amendment gives everyone the right to publicly speculate that the moon landing was faked, or that the earth is flat,\" Parker said. \"But there is a difference between someone venting about a favorite conspiracy theory and Google turning its platforms over to anonymous users for them to target and harass victims of public tragedies ' the former is free speech, the latter is violence.\"</p><p> Parker acknowledged lawmakers convened the panel to discuss censorship of political speech, but he asked them not to turn \"a blind eye to targeted harassment over the internet.\" He linked his harassment to those opposed to his gun control advocacy.</p><p> \"Even though some on this committee may not agree with my cause, they must recognize that the harassment and threats of violence I faced was an attempt to intimidate me, prevent me from telling Alison's story and speaking out against gun violence, and to silence my free speech rights,\" Parker said.</p><p>YouTube and other technology platforms have faced increasing criticism for failing to police the content users post. Videos of violent attacks appear on the platforms, which have roles in publicizing violence and hosting the hate-filled ideology breeding it.</p><p> For years, it has automatically flagged pornography and copyrighted music, yet YouTube has not been able to quell the upload and spread of videos depicting violence.</p><p> Parker enlisted the help of the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic, which contacted Google earlier this year with a list of Parker's demands, including taking down all videos showing Alison's death as well as prohibiting hoaxes or content that targets and harasses victims of public tragedies and their family members.</p><p> In the meantime, Parker has worked with the Honr Network, which was created by Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was among the 26 people shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. The network flags videos of Parker's daughter so he doesn't have to view them himself.</p><p> Bhatia told the subcommittee that hoax videos about the WDBJ shooting and those violating YouTube policies have been taken down, but he said news videos remain online. Sitting behind him, Parker shook his head.</p><p> In a brief review Tuesday afternoon of videos on YouTube related to the WDBJ shooting, videos claiming the shooting was a hoax and showing Alison's death are still available to view. Parker obtained the copyright of the video WDBJ captured of the shooting, and that video still can be found on YouTube.</p><p> Bhatia pointed to the sheer quantity of videos uploaded ' 500 hours a minute seeking to be posted ' and said the company is working to improve its technology to identify and take down videos that violate its policy.</p><p> \"You can't simply release the monster and say it's too big to control,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.</p><p> Even as YouTube has moved to make conspiracy videos harder to find by no longer suggesting those with \"borderline content\" or that \"misinform users in a harmful way,\" Parker urged Congress to do more.</p><p> \"There is an emerging consensus that this is an urgent crisis that merits an immediate public reckoning,\" Parker said.</p><p> He said Congress should remove Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so tech companies are held accountable for content they allow in their platforms.</p><p> The 26-word provision protects online platforms from liability for content users post, including tweets and Facebook posts, YouTube videos and Yelp restaurant reviews.</p><p> On the one hand, it was designed to keep the internet free of censorship. On the other hand, people like Parker become victims of harassment because they can't make platforms take down posts or sue them for damages.</p><p> \"As more and more public tragedies and horrific mass shootings occur, they will be recorded, broadcasted, and disseminated on platforms like YouTube like so much cheap entertainment for Google to use to add a few more millions to its bottom line,\" Parker said.</p><p> Barbara and Andy Parker, parents of slain journalist Alison Parker, react July 9 in Richmond at the end of the special session on gun violence called by Gov.

They said Parker's experience is just one example.</p><p> Parker has been an advocate for gun control since his daughter, WDBJ (Channel 7) journalist Alison Parker, was shot to death on live television at Smith Mountain Lake in August 2015.</p><p> The gunman, a disgruntled former WDBJ news employee, filmed the shooting and posted it on social media shortly after killing Alison Parker and her colleague, Adam Ward, and wounding chamber of commerce official Vicki Gardner.</p><p> Videos from the gunman's point of view as well as what was filmed by WDBJ spread across social media platforms, especially on YouTube, whose parent company is Google. They've also spawned conspiracy theories, such as the shooting being faked as part of a plan to seize guns.</p><p> \"I recognize the First Amendment gives everyone the right to publicly speculate that the moon landing was faked, or that the earth is flat,\" Parker said. \"But there is a difference between someone venting about a favorite conspiracy theory and Google turning its platforms over to anonymous users for them to target and harass victims of public tragedies ' the former is free speech, the latter is violence.\"</p><p> Parker acknowledged lawmakers convened the panel to discuss censorship of political speech, but he asked them not to turn \"a blind eye to targeted harassment over the internet.\" He linked his harassment to those opposed to his gun control advocacy.</p><p> \"Even though some on this committee may not agree with my cause, they must recognize that the harassment and threats of violence I faced was an attempt to intimidate me, prevent me from telling Alison's story and speaking out against gun violence, and to silence my free speech rights,\" Parker said.</p><p>YouTube and other technology platforms have faced increasing criticism for failing to police the content users post. Videos of violent attacks appear on the platforms, which have roles in publicizing violence and hosting the hate-filled ideology breeding it.</p><p> For years, it has automatically flagged pornography and copyrighted music, yet YouTube has not been able to quell the upload and spread of videos depicting violence.</p><p> Parker enlisted the help of the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic, which contacted Google earlier this year with a list of Parker's demands, including taking down all videos showing Alison's death as well as prohibiting hoaxes or content that targets and harasses victims of public tragedies and their family members.</p><p> In the meantime, Parker has worked with the Honr Network, which was created by Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was among the 26 people shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. The network flags videos of Parker's daughter so he doesn't have to view them himself.</p><p> Bhatia told the subcommittee that hoax videos about the WDBJ shooting and those violating YouTube policies have been taken down, but he said news videos remain online. Sitting behind him, Parker shook his head.</p><p> In a brief review Tuesday afternoon of videos on YouTube related to the WDBJ shooting, videos claiming the shooting was a hoax and showing Alison's death are still available to view. Parker obtained the copyright of the video WDBJ captured of the shooting, and that video still can be found on YouTube.</p><p> Bhatia pointed to the sheer quantity of videos uploaded ' 500 hours a minute seeking to be posted ' and said the company is working to improve its technology to identify and take down videos that violate its policy.</p><p> \"You can't simply release the monster and say it's too big to control,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.</p><p> Even as YouTube has moved to make conspiracy videos harder to find by no longer suggesting those with \"borderline content\" or that \"misinform users in a harmful way,\" Parker urged Congress to do more.</p><p> \"There is an emerging consensus that this is an urgent crisis that merits an immediate public reckoning,\" Parker said.</p><p> He said Congress should remove Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so tech companies are held accountable for content they allow in their platforms.</p><p> The 26-word provision protects online platforms from liability for content users post, including tweets and Facebook posts, YouTube videos and Yelp restaurant reviews.</p><p> On the one hand, it was designed to keep the internet free of censorship. On the other hand, people like Parker become victims of harassment because they can't make platforms take down posts or sue them for damages.</p><p> \"As more and more public tragedies and horrific mass shootings occur, they will be recorded, broadcasted, and disseminated on platforms like YouTube like so much cheap entertainment for Google to use to add a few more millions to its bottom line,\" Parker said.</p><p> Barbara and Andy Parker, parents of slain journalist Alison Parker, react July 9 in Richmond at the end of the special session on gun violence called by Gov.

While every brand still wants to squeeze out all available power from ubiquitous four-cylinder motors, providing excess is only a priority in a handful of cases catering directly to enthusiasts.    The idea of a big, brutish luxury car with a monstrous engine still exists, but it\u2019s being supplanted by technology-driven features catering to tech-focused minds and the green movement. Modern luxury is based in connectivity, applications, and distancing one from the experience of driving altogether  \u2014 or at least that\u2019s what the automotive industry now seems to believe.    And they may have a point. While we\u2019re well aware those advocating \u201cmobility\u201d desperately want it so that they can tap into your data (to enhance revenue using the same grimy business tactics favored by big tech firms), carmakers also need something shiny to dangle in front of consumers so we\u2019ll buy the latest and greatest product. The tech sector is also booming right now, and the industry\u2019s dying to get investors back on its side after seeing the Wall Street performance of EV companies  \u2014 especially Tesla Motors.    Even the traditionalists at Toyota are buying into it, announcing an important push into software development as they attempt to craft the next industry-standard operating system for cars. It\u2019s also the song Volkswagen Group has sung ever since Dieselgate. Meanwhile, Audi recently explained its own commitment to software after its parent company (VW) tasked it with ensuring the botched launches of the ID.3 and Mk8 Golf don\u2019t become commonplace.    \u201cWhen it comes to digitalization we are lagging behind  \u2014 for now,\u201d Audi CEO Markus Duesmann said in an interview explaining the company\u2019s new Project Artemis program to Reuters (via the New York Times ) .    The project involves taking around 200 employees and using them to accelerate the software going into a scalable vehicle platform; they\u2019ll be allowed to operate somewhat autonomously from Volkswagen Group. Duesmann said this is necessary due to the stakes at play. The group already intends to bring a \u201chighly automated\u201d electric vehicle to the public in just a handful of years.    \u201cTo develop a new car with so many new features in this period until 2024 is so demanding that it is probably without precedent. That\u2019s why we have decided to work with a separate unit,\u201d he explained.    From Reuters :    With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicles need processors and software operating systems to analyze data from radar, lidar, and camera sensors to calculate driving reflexes so cars can navigate and avoid accidents on their own.    In the past, bigger cars with more powerful engines were automatically better. Now computing power and intelligence will be a key metric for defining what is premium, forcing Audi and VW to retool the way they design cars.    \u201cTechnical development of vehicles is no longer organized according to a vehicle\u2019s size, but by the car\u2019s electrical and electronic architecture,\u201d Duesmann said, explaining that premium and high-value models would now differentiate themselves according to their computing power and sensor levels.    We\u2019d like to use this opportunity to remind our readers that self-driving cars still don\u2019t exist. The technology has seen its development slow to a crawl in recent years as R&amp;D teams realized training a machine to account for all variables is a difficult proposition. It should also be said that \u201cbigger cars with more powerful engines\u201d are still objectively better. Circumstances (income, where one lives, etc.) and personal preference may direct someone toward a smaller, less potent automobile \u2014 often resulting in the ideal product for the customer \u2014 but more is still more in terms of cars.    Until Bentley starts selling pint-sized economy models for $250,000 and Lamborghini stops thinking 0-60 times matter, that will remain true. However, convincing the public that something using half the materials is worth as much as an older design with twice the mass and a juicier dyno sheet (like Dodge) would be a boon to automakers looking to sell you on touchscreens and the same connectivity that\u2019s already available on your phone. The only real bright spot is the enhanced safety features offered by equipping cars with sensors and more computer power, but those systems have proven occasionally annoying, highly fallible, and may even make us worse motorists.    Still, there may be no other way. Much of the industry is already deep into the process of digitizing everything it possibly can as the situation snowballs down the mountain. Any company snubbing the assumed technological bonanza runs the risk of looking old-fashioned, falling behind and losing out on wads of cash made available through data acquisition and updated business models. This is also why so many of these big moves between industry giants look so similar.    Audi\u2019s Project Artemis is a near carbon copy of Woven Planet Holdings (aka the rebranded Toyota Research Institute). Both use names that distance themselves from traditional industry players, designed to welcome new partnerships and outside investment. Self-driving is a concern but secondary to building on the software used for in-car operating systems and the new features they bring to the table. Ideally, VW Group would like to see this happen as quickly as possible.    \u201cIf we gain speed with a supplier or with a software company, we will consider it. Speed is extremely important,\u201d Duesmann said. China is also supposed to play a large role in the program but the CEO declined to elaborate.    Artemis will be working alongside VW\u2019s Car.Software team, rather than absorbing it. Duesmann noted it will be important to have staffers embedded in various departments to ensure a degree of mental flexibility. Not that we\u2019re seeing many new ideas, overall. The public now understands that the promise of self-driving vehicles is a largely empty one, and Artemis\u2019 plan to bring a semi-autonomous vehicle to market by 2024 sounds awful familiar. Audi\u2019s real goal is solving Volkswagen\u2019s software issues while gently copying BMW\u2019s Project i\u2026 which was established roughly a decade ago and has already delivered a couple of novelty cars.

Top level EU competition law has not touched on the social media axis of big tech yet, with the Commission concentrating recent attention on mobile chips (Qualcomm); and mobile and ecommerce platforms (mostly Google; but Amazon\u2019s use of merchant data is in its sights too); as well as probing Apple\u2019s tax structure in Ireland.  But last week Europe\u2019s data protection supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli,  told us that closer working between privacy regulators and the EU\u2019s Competition Commission is on the cards, as regional lawmakers look to evolve their oversight frameworks to respond to growing ethical concerns about use and abuse of big data, and indeed to be better positioned to respond to fast-paced technology-fuelled change.  Local EU antitrust regulators, including in Germany and France, have also been investigating the Google, Facebook adtech duopoly on several fronts in recent years.  The Libe committee\u2019s call is the latest political call to spin up and scale up antitrust effort and attention around social media. </p><p>  The committee also says it wants to see much greater accountability and transparency on \u201calgorithmic-processed data by any actor, be it private or public\u201d \u2014 signalling a belief that GDPR does not go far enough on that front.  Libe committee chair and rapporteur, MEP Claude Moraes, has previously suggested the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal could help inform and shape an update to Europe\u2019s ePrivacy rules, which remain at the negotiation stage with disagreements over scope and proportionality.  But every big tech data breach and security scandal lends weight to the argument that stronger privacy rules are indeed required.  In yesterday\u2019s resolution, the Libe committee also called for an audit of the advertising industry on social media \u2014 echoing a call made by the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, the ICO, this summer for an \u2018ethical pause\u2018 on the use of online ads for political purposes.  The ICO made that call right after announcing it planned to issue Facebook with the maximum fine possible under UK data protection law \u2014 again for the Cambridge Analytica breach.  While the Cambridge Analytica scandal \u2014 in which the personal information of as many as 87 million Facebook users was extracted from the platform without the knowledge or consent of every person, and passed to the now defunct political consultancy (which used it to create psychographic profiles of US voters for election campaigning purposes) \u2014 has triggered this latest round of political scrutiny of the social media behemoth, last month Facebook revealed another major data breach, affecting at least 50M users \u2014 underlining the ongoing challenge it has to live up to claims of having \u2018locked the platform down\u2019.  In light of both breaches, the Libe committee has now called for EU bodies to be allowed to fully audit Facebook \u2014 to independently assess its data protection and security practices.  Buttarelli also told us last week that it\u2019s his belief none of the tech giants are directing adequate resource at keeping user data safe.  And with Facebook having already revealed a second breach that\u2019s potentially even larger than Cambridge Analytica fresh focus and political attention is falling on the substance of its security practices, not just its claims.  While the Libe committee\u2019s MEPs say they have taken note of steps Facebook made in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to try to improve user privacy, they point out it has still not yet carried out the promised full internal audit.  Facebook has never said how long this historical app audit will take. Though it has given some progress reports, such as detailing additional suspicious activity it has found to date, with 400 apps suspended at the last count. (One app, called myPersonality, also got banned for improper data controls.)  The Libe committee is now urging Facebook to allow the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and the European Data Protection Board, which plays a key role in applying the region\u2019s data protection rules, to carry out \u201ca full and independent audit\u201d \u2014 and present the findings to the European Commission and Parliament and national parliaments.  It has also recommended that Facebook makes \u201csubstantial modifications to its platform\u201d to comply with EU data protection law.  We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the recommendations \u2014 including specifically asking the company whether it\u2019s open to an external audit of its platform.  At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to our question but we\u2019ll update this report with any response.  Commenting in a statement, Libe chair Moraes said: \u201cThis resolution makes clear that we expect measures to be taken to protect citizens\u2019 right to private life, data protection and freedom of expression. Improvements have been made since the scandal, but, as the Facebook data breach of 50 million accounts showed just last month, these do not go far enough.\u201d  The committee has also made a series of proposals for reducing the risk of social media being used as an attack vector for election interference \u2014 including:    applying conventional \u201coff-line\u201d electoral safeguards, such as rules on transparency and limits to spending, respect for silence periods and equal treatment of candidates;  making it easy to recognize online political paid advertisements and the organisation behind them;  banning profiling for electoral purposes, including use of online behaviour that may reveal political preferences;  social media platforms should label content shared by bots and speed up the process of removing fake accounts;  compulsory post-campaign audits to ensure personal data are deleted;  investigations by member states with the support of Eurojust if necessary, into alleged misuse of the online political space by foreign forces.  A couple of weeks ago, the Commission outted a voluntary industry Code of Practice aimed at tackling online disinformation which several tech platforms and adtech companies had agreed to sign up to, and which also presses for action in some of the same areas \u2014 including fake accounts and bots.  However the code is not only voluntary but does not bind signatories to any specific policy steps or processes so it looks like its effectiveness will be as difficult to quantify as its accountability will lack bite.  A UK parliamentary committee which has also been probing political disinformation this year also put out a report this summer with a package of proposed measures \u2014 with some similar ideas but also suggesting a levy on social media to \u2018defend democracy\u2019.  Meanwhile Facebook itself has been working on increasing transparency around advertisers on its platform, and putting in place some authorization requirements for political advertisers (though starting in the US first).  But few politicians appear ready to trust that the steps Facebook is taking will be enough to avoid a repeat of, for example, the mass Kremlin propaganda smear campaign that targeted the 2016 US presidential election.  The Libe committee has also urged all EU institutions, agencies and bodies to verify that their social media pages, and any analytical and marketing tools they use, \u201cshould not by any means put at risk the personal data of citizens\u201d.  And it goes as far as suggesting that EU bodies could even \u201cconsider closing their Facebook accounts\u201d \u2014 as a measure to protect the personal data of every individual contacting them.  The committee\u2019s full resolution was passed by 41 votes to 10 and 1 abstention. And will be put to a vote by the full EU Parliament during the next plenary session later this month.  In it, the Libe also renews its call for the suspension of the EU-US Privacy Shield.  The data transfer arrangement, which is used by thousands of businesses to authorize transfers of EU users\u2019 personal data across the Atlantic, is under growing pressure ahead of an annual review this month, as the Trump administration has failed entirely to respond as EU lawmakers had hoped their US counterparts would at the time of the agreement being inked in the Obama era, back in 2016.  The EU parliament also called for Privacy Shield to be suspended this summer. And while the Commission did not act on those calls, pressure has continued to mount from MEPs and EU consumer and digital and civil rights bodies.  During the Privacy Shield review process this month the Commission will be pressuring US counterparts to try to gain concessions that it can sell back home as \u2018compliance\u2019.  But without very major concessions \u2014 and who would bank on that, given the priorities of the current US administration \u2014 the future of the precariously placed mechanism looks increasingly uncertain.  Even as more oversight coming down the pipe to rule social media platforms looks all but inevitable in Europe.    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN897021720181011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG5-G2R1-J9XT-P4Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 11, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Enforcing such access obligations is, however, challenging where the data in question is personal data. Based on three case studies, Bird &amp; Bird partners, Anne Federle (competition law) and Benoit Van Asbroeck (IT &amp; data protection), are exploring in this article whether and how companies can obtain access to personal data collected by another market player.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Does competition law give a right of access to another company's data?</p><p>The fact that data collected by a company can be an indispensable input for the business activities of other companies - and thus for the continued existence of effective competition on certain markets - is increasingly being recognized by competition authorities. In particular large multi-sided online platforms such as Amazon, Facebook and Google have been identified as having collected vast volumes of highly valuable consumer data that make it difficult for smaller companies and new market entrants to compete with them. As Commissioner Magrethe Vestager put it: \"Data allows you to be competitive. You can develop excellent and innovative technologies but if you do not have access to data at the same time, you will not be able to offer clients good service\". She therefore declared that \"Access to data has to be redesigned so that newcomers can compete with big tech giants.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIRD &amp; BIRD PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 BIRD &amp; BIRD PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Bird &amp; Bird provides legal advisory services.

The adoption of these new guidelines follows a series of public consultations (the last one took place at the end of 2019) and is part of the FCA's efforts to simplify and modernize merger control in France.</p><p>Merger control guidelines provide a practical framework for notifying undertakings regarding the application of merger control rules and the expected content of the notification file. They also help companies to understand potential competition law issues which may be raised by a transaction.</p><p>The new guidelines take into account the most recent case law of the FCA and the French Conseil d'Etat since 2013 - in particular with regard to gun jumping as well as the monitoring/revision of commitments - and announce some innovations both in terms of procedure and competition analysis.</p><p>Changes in the merger notification procedure include in particular:</p><p>the extension of the eligibility of certain transactions to the simplified procedure (allowing companies to submit a lighter notification file and leading to a decision of the FCA within a shortened period of approximately 3 weeks); the communication to the notifying party of an indicative provisional timetable if the transaction needs an in-depth competition assessment (i.e. phase 2); the possibility to have a case handler appointed within 5 working days to start pre-notification discussions; the FCA's commitment to confirm within 10 working days of the notification whether or not (i) the notification file is complete and (ii) the transaction is eligible for the simplified procedure. Although this is a non-binding deadline for the FCA, it should give companies better visibility on the timeline for the investigation of their transaction.</p><p>August 18: Bird &amp; Bird: Anti-Monopoly Case (Taiwan Cement Corporation and OYAK): Failure to Legally Declare Joint Venture</p><p>On August 13, 2019, the State Administration for Market Regulation (\"SAMR\") commenced an investigation into Dutch OYAK TCC Holdings B.V. (\"Joint Venture\"), a joint venture between Taiwan Cement Corporation (\"Taiwan Cement\") and Ordu Yardimlasma Kurumu (\"OYAK\") for failing to declare the concentration of business operators.</p><p>During the investigation, the SAMR found that on October 25, 2018, Taiwan Cement and OYAK signed a share subscription agreement, shareholders' agreement and articles of association in relation to the Joint Venture; the shareholding of which comprised: (a) an investment by OYAK via its existing cement business and assets in Turkey to acquire 60% of the shares; and (b) a cash contribution by Taiwan Cement to acquire the remaining 40% of the shares. On November 26, 2018, Taiwan Cement and OYAK completed the business of registration of the Joint Venture.</p><p>The SAMR found that the Joint Venture was a concentration of business operators for the purposes of Article 20 of the Anti-Monopoly Law, and that the turnover of both Taiwan Cement and Oyakin in 2017 reached the declaration standard stipulated by Article 3 of Provisions of the State Council on the Declaration Standard of Business Operators Concentration. For these reasons, Taiwan Cement and OYAK were required to file the above mentioned declaration before completing the business registration of the Joint Venture. However, the parties failed to do so, in violation of Article 21 of the Anti-Monopoly Law. Despite this failure by the parties to file the required declaration, the SAMR found that it did not have the effect of eliminating and restricting competition in the market after conducting its competition assessment.</p><p>Based on its investigation and the outcomes of its evaluations, the SAMR decided to impose an administrative penalty of RMB 300,000.00 on Taiwan Cement and OYAK respectively on the basis of Article 48 and Article 49 of Anti-Monopoly Law and Article 13 of Interim Measures for Investigating and Handling Failure to Legally Declare the Concentration of Business Operators.</p><p>August 18: Bird &amp; Bird: UK ' Merger thresholds for mergers in critical sectors revised</p><p>The UK government has given the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) further powers to review mergers in strategically important sectors. These steps include making changes to the Enterprise Act 2002 (Enterprise Act) to provide the government with extended powers to scrutinise foreign takeovers to ensure they do not impact upon the UK's ability to tackle COVID-19 or other related public health emergencies.</p><p>Initial amendment to the Enterprise Act in 2018</p><p>In 2018, the government amended the turnover test and the share of supply test under the Enterprise Act to allow the CMA to review mergers that would otherwise have fallen outside the previous merger test, in the areas of dual and military-use technology, quantum technology and computer hardware. Where the target falls within one of these sectors, the relevant thresholds were lowered as follows:</p><p>the turnover threshold - for the turnover of the target business - was lowered from Pound70 million to Pound1 million for businesses in those sectors; and</p><p>the requirement in the share of supply test for an increase in the parties' combined share of supply to a figure of more than 25% was replaced by a requirement that the target business alone should have a share of supply of 25% or more of the relevant goods or services, i.e. there is no need for the parties to overlap.</p><p>If either test is met, the \"relevant merger situation\" is capable of being reviewed by the CMA.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 18: Bird &amp; Bird: ICA launches investigation into Apple and Amazon for alleged restrictions in the online sale of Apple and Beats branded products</p><p>On 22 July, the Italian Competition Authority (the \"ICA\") announced it had opened an investigation against Apple and Amazon for an alleged violation of article 101 TFEU.</p><p>Following a complaint received in February 2019 from a retailer who was banned from reselling products on the Amazon market, the investigation was launched in order to ascertain whether Apple and Amazon have implemented a competition-restricting agreement to prohibit the sale of Apple and Beats-branded products by certain electronics retailers.</p><p>According to the complainant, in execution of an agreement between the Apple and Amazon groups in 2018, the latter removed from the Italian marketplace all retailers who had previously legitimately offered Apple and Beats products through the Amazon marketplace, as they were not members of Apple's official programme.</p><p>In the ICA's view, the agreement would appear to prevent access to intermediary services for sale on marketplaces, where Amazon is the primary player, to resellers of consumer electronics products that do not adhere to Apple's official distribution programs, but which legally sell Apple and Beats products by purchasing them through the Apple wholesaler channel.</p><p>The contested conduct appears prima facie to constitute an infringement of Article 101(1)(b) TFEU in that it is likely to create a significant barrier for unofficial resellers to enter into the market for the online sale of electronic products by reducing the online offer of Apple and Beats products.</p><p>In addition, these same restrictions, according to the ICA, could limit the incentives to compete effectively on the price of Apple and Beats products, as well as prevent the integration of European markets and restrict parallel trade.</p><p>The assessments will be carried out by the ICA taking into account that, in the current market scenario, the use of e-commerce and distance purchasing makes access to the marketplace services provided by Amazon an essential element of competitiveness, especially for small and medium-sized national enterprises.</p><p>August 17: Bird &amp; Bird: Australia Chapter in \"Antitrust and Intellectual Property Review\" Fifth Edition</p><p>Our Australian competition and IP team have recently contributed a chapter to \"The Intellectual Property and Antitrust Review\" Fifth Edition. In this edition, they discuss topical issues at the intersection of competition (antitrust) law and intellectual property in Australia.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 14: Bird &amp; Bird: European Commission launches sector inquiry into consumer Internet of Things (IoT)</p><p>On 16 July 2020 the European Commission launched a sector inquiry into the Internet of Things (IoT) for consumer-related products and services.</p><p>The inquiry will focus on \"consumer-related products and services that are connected to a network and can be controlled at a distance, for example via a voice assistant or mobile device, including smart home appliances and wearable devices\". Consumer-related IoT products and services in the Union is already an important sector, which is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. The total number of smart home devices in the EU is likely to rise to 184 million by 2023.</p><p>The Commission mentions several restrictions of competition law that could emerge in relation to IoT. It will focus on looking into data access and interoperability practices as well as certain forms of self-preferencing and practices linked to technology standards and standard essential patents (SEPs). Finally, network effects, economies of scale and the emergence of digital ecosystems and gatekeepers will also be investigated as part of the inquiry. Some of these issues have already come up in the assessment of the Google/Fitbit transaction (see here) and the investigation into Amazon's use of data from independent retailers.</p><p>The goal of a sector inquiry is to gather market information to better understand the potential competition issues and guide the Commission's future enforcement of competition law in the sector. If, during the sector inquiry, the Commission identifies problematic restrictions of competition law, it can open an investigation to enforce article 101 and/or 102 TFEU. The previous sector inquiry into the e-commerce sector led to cases such as Guess (AT.40428) and consumer electronics (AT.40181, AT.40182, AT.40465 and AT.40469).</p><p>For the purposes of this sector investigation, the Commission has sent requests for information to around 400 market players active at various levels of the supply chain.</p><p>August 13: Bird &amp; Bird: Revision of EEA Interchange Fee Regulation appears unlikely ' at least for now</p><p>Card issuers, acquirers and merchants are among those preparing for a public hearing to take stock of the EEA Interchange Fee Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/751 - IFR), due to be organised by the European Commission on 7 December 2020. This follows the recent publication of a Commission report on the impact of the IFR (staff working paper available here), which notably stated that a revision of the IFR would not be proposed at this stage. Prior to submitting its report, the Commission also published a study prepared on its behalf by Ernst &amp; Young and Copenhagen Economics on the IFR (available here) which fed its decision-making process.</p><p>The Commission's report was submitted to the European Parliament and EU Council on 29 June 2020, more than a year past its deadline. To recall, according to Article 17 of the IFR, the Commission had been required to submit a report by 9 June 2019, accompanied if appropriate by a legislative proposal to amend the IFR. In principle, the Parliament (either at plenary level or at Committee level) could now choose to debate the report. However, arranging parliamentary debates in the current circumstances is very difficult and the Parliament is giving priority to the economic recovery plan for Europe. At the time of writing there was no initiative to hold such a debate.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 12: Bird &amp; Bird: Reports of Trade Mark Cases for CIPA July 2020</p><p>In this month's report, we report on the High Court's decision concerning the Protected Designation of Origin for Prosecco and the deceptive nature of the NOSECCO trade mark, in Les Grands Chais de France SAS v Consorzio di Tutela della Denominazione di Origine Controllata Prosecco ([2020] EWHC 1633 (Ch)).

Source: Company Website</p><p>August 10: Bird &amp; Bird: One giant (regulatory) leap for UK spaceflight: the launch of the UK Government's consultation on the supporting regulations to the Space Industry Act 2018</p><p>The recognition of space as an important contributor to the UK's economy, society, national security and its role in shaping technological innovation is not new. The most recent statistics from the UK Space Agency show that the Pound15 billion UK space industry has continued to grow and more than Pound300 billion of wider UK GDP is supported by satellite services (telecommunications, meteorology, Earth observation and navigation).</p><p>However, in recent years, the importance of space as a strategic priority has become demonstrably more significant for the UK. In 2019, the UK Ministry of Defence announced its intention to scale up its military space activities and look to develop a Defence Space Strategy, and the Space Innovation and Growth Strategy 2014 - 2030 sets a target of the UK capturing 10% of the global market for space by 2030. In addition to increased national programmes and recent investments (notably the UK's investment in OneWeb earlier this year), the UK increased its contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA) to Pound374 million per year (for the next five years from 2019), making the UK the fourth largest contributing ESA Member State after Germany, France and Italy.</p><p>The development of a UK spaceflight programme is an important part of the UK's target to grow its share of the global sector in the next decade. The programme will involve commercial spaceflight technologies such as vertical and horizontal (air-launched) launches of small satellites from UK spaceports as well as the launch of sub-orbital spaceplanes and balloons. Underpinning the development of such an ambitious spaceflight programme is a robust regulatory framework. The establishment of this framework began with the Space Industry Act 2018, which became UK law on 15 March 2018.</p><p>The three sets of implementing regulations - the subject of the current consultation - are now the next step in establishing this spaceflight regulatory framework.</p><p>August 05: Bird &amp; Bird: Patents: invalidity for insufficiency across broad range of products claimed</p><p>Summary</p><p>The Supreme Court has held that two patents for a transgenic mouse used for the development of human antibodies were invalid for insufficiency.</p><p>Background</p><p>A patent may be revoked if its specification does not disclose the invention clearly and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art (section 72(1)(c), Patents Act 1977).</p><p>A European patent application must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (Article 83, European Patent Convention) (EPC) (Article 83). Patent claims must be clear and concise and supported by the description (Article 84, EPC) (Article 84). Articles 83 and 84 give effect to the legal principle that a patent monopoly must be justified by the technical contribution to the art that the disclosure of the invention has made.</p><p>Facts</p><p>R sued K for infringement of two patents relating to the production of human antibodies using transgenic mice. These patents were based on a gene manipulation technique which inserted human gene elements involved in generating antibodies into a section of the corresponding mouse gene, overcoming a known problem which arose, resulting in mice suffering from a reduced immune response, or immunological sickness, which seriously impaired their efficiency as platforms for antibody development.</p><p>The High Court held that the patents were invalid for insufficiency, but that, if they had been valid, K infringed some of the claims.

With 5,620 licensed operators, the sector has rapidly moved from a hobby to a professional service. It now supports industries such as law enforcement, land management, facilities operation and TV. As the use of drone technology in the commercial sector becomes more feasible and popular, it is also becoming increasingly regulated. Yet, until now, there has been no single source of guidance on the laws relating to drone use. Critically, there were no templates or precedents specifically written for this growing industry. Often, drone operators use repurposed general commercial contracts that do not address the specific risks in the use of drones.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 22: Bird &amp; Bird advises InGeneron on divestment of Eticur GmbH</p><p>Bird &amp; Bird LLP has advised the US company InGeneron on the sale of 100% of the shares in the Munich-based private umbilical cord blood banking company Eticur GmbH to Polski Bank Komorek Macierzystych.</p><p>Headquartered in Houston and Munich, InGeneron is a privately held company that was formed to innovate cell-based technologies for healthcare and life sciences research.

In view of the rapidly declining postal volumes, the two operators PostNL and Sandd consider(ed) the combination of their nationwide postal networks necessary to ensure continuity and affordability of postal services in The Netherlands. After an in-depth phase 2 merger control investigation, the ACM however rejected on 5 September 2019 the request for merger clearance stating that the creation of a network monopoly in the field of postal services will lead to significant price increases and is not justified by economic efficiencies nor necessary for the provision of the universal postal service.</p><p>On 27 September 2019 the Minister de facto over-ruled the refusal by ACM and granted a licence (see also our earlier newsletter) on the basis of overriding public interests including the continuity and affordability of high quality postal services in the longer term, better protection of postal employees and the financial interests of the Dutch state. This licence was subject to conditions on PostNL ensuring that the postal tariffs are cost-based (capping the return on mail services at 9%), that the costs for integration of Sandd will not be attributed to the basic postal service and obliging PostNL to provide access to its national network for regional postal transport companies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Bird &amp; Bird: The Three Point Plan to manage your supply contracts in a new normal</p><p>When recession and financial turmoil strikes (as we are currently experiencing ) the scene changes fast.

There is a purchase option for the remaining 20% over the next three years.</p><p>Gamma is a leading provider of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) in the UK, Spain and the Netherlands, and has identified Germany as an important target market as part of its expansion strategy. According to the company, the total German market has around 36 million PBX lines, but only around 6% cloud connection. The market for cloud telephony is therefore expected to grow steadily in the coming years.</p><p>Gamma's goal is to develop and sell a market leading cloud PBX solution through the channel to accelerate HFO's growth in the emerging cloud PBX market in Germany. HFO also offers B2B mobile services through its subsidiary Epsilon Telecom, with more than 100,000 lines sold annually. This also provides Gamma with the opportunity to sell a mobile cloud PBX product through this channel.</p><p>Bird &amp; Bird also recently advised Gamma on public offer for VOZTELECOM OIGAA360, S.A (\"VozTelecom\") in Spain. VozTelecom is one of the leading Cloud PBX providers in Spain and is the largest Cloud PBX business aside from the major fixed line and mobile network operators.</p><p>The following Bird &amp; Bird lawyers advised Gamma Communications plc on this complex step acquisition: Partner Stefan Munch, Partner Stephan Kubler, LL.M., Counsel Michael Gassner and Associates Marcel Nurk, Marijana Simonova (all Corporate/M&amp;A, Munich), Partner Dr. Ralph Panzer, Associates Julia Gottinger and Laura Schildberg (all Employment Law, Munchen) Partner Dr. Henriette Picot, Partner Dr. Alexander Duisberg, Associate Goekhan Kosak (all Tech &amp; Comms, Munich), Senior Counsel Valerian Jenny (Foreign Trade Law, Frankfurt), Partner Dr.</p><p>July 09: Bird &amp; Bird: Pon/NS: applying behavioural remedies to digital platforms in the context of a merger</p><p>On 20 May 2020 the Dutch competition authority (\"ACM\") conditionally cleared a new joint venture between transport company Pon Netherlands B.V. (\"Pon\") and Dutch rail operator NS Groep N.V. (\"NS\") creating a Mobility as a Service (\"MaaS\") platform. The case was referred to the ACM by the European Commission (\"Commission\") under Article 9 of the EU Merger Regulation earlier this year.</p><p>This case is notable, because it shows a competition authority's approach to digital platforms in the context of a merger. Although no significant market power on the downstream market would be created with the joint venture, ACM required behavioural remedies in an attempt perceived as preventing the mobility platform from achieving a significant market position or even a so-called gatekeeper role.</p><p>This approach is especially interesting with a view to the European Commission's consultation on a proposal to introduce a New Competition Tool and a roadmap for an ex-ante regulation for very large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers which could make such a cautious approach potentially unnecessary. Also, ACM announced on 30 June 2020 that it will conduct a market study into the ability of new entrants to offer innovative mobility services.</p><p>In this blog, the background of the case, ACM's concerns on the relevant markets and the remedies eventually accepted by ACM are briefly discussed.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 5001111723</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2108202323063787000139376</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-JNM1-DXKH-N0XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5320\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.
