But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Some of these innovations have made our life better - just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact - think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/> As the President of IBMsaid in 1943: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that \"the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/> It's true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks - at least in some parts of the value chain.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/> A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.<br/><br/><br/><br/> At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.<br/><br/><br/><br/> With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly - banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge - just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don't know how well they would work in such situations.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.<br/><br/><br/><br/> And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone - banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.<br/><br/><br/><br/> There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of \"same business, same risks, same rules\". That is important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.<br/><br/>     We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.<br/><br/>     We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.<br/><br/>     And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.<br/><br/><br/><br/> We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshop today serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Such exchanges are vital.<br/><br/><br/><br/> I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!<br/><br/><br/><br/> Thank you for your attention.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-APMN14184120170329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6J-7CY1-DXCW-D4W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 29, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.<br/><br/><br/><br/> A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.<br/><br/><br/><br/> At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.<br/><br/><br/><br/> With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly - banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge - just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don't know how well they would work in such situations.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.<br/><br/><br/><br/> And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone - banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.<br/><br/><br/><br/> There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of \"same business, same risks, same rules\". That is important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.<br/><br/>     We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.<br/><br/>     We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.<br/><br/>     And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.<br/><br/><br/><br/> We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshop today serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Such exchanges are vital.<br/><br/><br/><br/> I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!<br/><br/><br/><br/> Thank you for your attention.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-APMN11009920170328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N65-84Y1-DXCW-D4WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 28, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>IBM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>IBM (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001080</classCode><className>MARKET SHARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Some of these innovations have made our life better - just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact - think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/> As the President of IBMsaid in 1943: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that \"the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/> The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/> It's true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks - at least in some parts of the value chain.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs.

At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk.

The combination of today's final keynote speeches - European policy by Jeroen Dijsselbloem and my perspective as a central banker - is thus fitting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the financial crisis, central banks throughout the world have felt the need, one after the other, to turn to unconventional monetary policy. This has meant that central bank policy is having a greater impact on the banking sector and the financial markets than ever before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The financial and economic crisis has more or less been consigned to history. Central banks are now starting to exit the non-standard policy measures introduced in response to the crisis. As you can well imagine, for me, it is an extremely interesting but also challenging time to take over the helm for markets on the Bundesbank's Executive Board and ultimately to be responsible, inter alia, for the operational implementation of monetary policy.</p><p>Experts are focusing their discussions on two main points. First, which challenges and necessities, risks and opportunities need to be taken into consideration during the exit procedure? But we are also pondering what will come next? What will the financial markets look like in the near future? I would like to present some initial ideas on this subject in my talk today. 2 What can we learn from other central banks' exit? Which decisions are coming up in the euro area?</p><p>Let me begin with the first point. What shape might our exit from non-standard monetary policy take? I shall start by looking a little further afield; to the United States and Japan. How are other currency areas dealing with expansionary monetary policy? I will then move on to consider individual measures in the euro area: interest rate policy, purchase programmes and refinancing. Experience with quantitative easing in the United States and Japan</p><p>The United States started the quantitative easing experiment way ahead of the euro area, and is also much further along with the exit process. Many market participants are thus trying to use US monetary policy normalisation to second guess what will happen in the euro area. The debate always comes back to the length of a central bank's balance sheet.</p><p>At this point, I would like to have a quick look at the decisions taken by the Federal Reserve System. The Fed embarked on a very expansionary course of monetary policy back in 2008-2009. This included purchasing assets on a large scale; a practice known as quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve System concluded its last large-scale asset purchase programme in autumn 2014. From then until the autumn of 2017, the Federal Reserve System reinvested any funds that became available on a more or less regular basis. During this time - that is, from December 2015 - the Fed began steadily putting up interest rates. In October 2017, the Fed started gradually reducing the reinvestment of principal payments. In parallel, from December 2017 to date, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate further. The Fed is still following this course. At the beginning of November, the Fed's asset holdings - not just from purchases - amounted to around US$3.9 billion. That is still a high level, even years after switching monetary policy.</p><p>At an early juncture, the Fed declared that it expected its balance sheet at the end of monetary policy normalisation to be much larger than before the crisis - but only as large as it deemed necessary to be able to implement monetary policy decisions effectively and efficiently. But how long should a central bank's balance sheet be in the future? That question remains unanswered as yet. In the meantime, regulation and endogenous market developments have also changed market participants' liquidity requirements.</p><p>Experience in the United States has shown how monetary policy normalisation could take place. But this could never be a one-for-one blueprint for the Eurosystem. While the two currency areas may share some similarities, there are also vast differences. This is especially true of financial market structures and the monetary policy transmission process which, in Europe, takes place to a greater extent via banks and less so via the capital market. But we can learn two things in particular from the Federal Reserve System's example. First, how to successfully communicate our exit from expansionary monetary policy. With carefully chosen and well-designed forward guidance, central banks can influence market participants' expectations. Second, monetary policy normalisation takes time.</p><p>Japan is another case entirely. In Japan, the speculative bubble burst in the early 1990s. In the ensuing 'lost decade', the Japanese economy was plagued by a period of mild deflation. In 1999, the Bank of Japan adopted a zero interest rate policy; it has been pursuing quantitative easing since 2001.</p><p>At the beginning of the new millennium, the Japanese economy began to find its feet again. The Bank of Japan ended its quantitative easing in 2006 and was about to return its monetary policy to the money market rate. But at that moment, as of 2007, the money markets started to dry up and the global financial and economic crisis set in. Consumer prices in Japan tumbled. As a result, the Bank of Japan decided to return to a policy of 'comprehensive monetary easing' in 2010, including interest rate targets for interbank interest rates, repo transactions and asset purchases - including in the real estate sector.\u00a0 In 2016, the deposit facility rate entered into negative territory (-0.1%) for the first time.</p><p>Today, the Bank of Japan holds around 50% of all outstanding Japanese government bonds. Debt accordingly amounts to about 85% of Japanese gross domestic product. Alongside demographic change, the enormous level of government debt is one of the main problems that Japan faces. Government debt has been growing since the early 1990s, accelerated by one crisis after another, and it is mainly held in the domestic domain. In the meantime, a nexus has emerged between government debt, the central bank and domestic creditors, and this is seriously limiting the economic scope.</p><p>The situation in Japan teaches us one important lesson: it is crucial that we do not miss the right moment for exit. This is a challenge of which we at the Bundesbank are well aware. Upcoming decisions on phasing out non-standard measures</p><p>Another question of timing concerns the upcoming decisions by the ECB Governing Council on how non-standard monetary policy measures will be phased out. At the national central banks, such as the Bundesbank, we implement these decisions made by the Governing Council. Let me now take a closer look at three upcoming decisions: first, the purchase programmes; second, interest rate policy; and third, refinancing.</p><p>The purchase programmes are continuing to have an expansionary impact in terms of monetary policy, even if - provided that there are no further substantial changes - the Eurosystem will no longer be making net purchases as of January 2019. At that time, bond holdings will amount to around \u20ac2.6 trillion. As decided by the ECB Governing Council, the Eurosystem will reinvest the proceeds from maturing bonds 'for an extended period of time and, in any case, for as long as necessary'. This keeps the level of excess liquidity high. There will therefore continue to be significant bond holdings on the central bank balance sheet - and, accordingly, an expansionary monetary policy stance - for a while longer.</p><p>To a certain extent, it is like driving a car: by reinvesting, the Eurosystem is keeping its foot on the accelerator. But we are not pressing any harder by making more net purchases. The ECB Governing Council will decide on the details of the reinvestment policy in December 2018. In this context, it has already been indicated upfront that the ECB capital key should remain the deciding factor in how the government bond purchases will be allocated among the central banks. In the Bundesbank's view, it is vital that these purchases are market-neutral and do not lead to distortions. That also demands a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the investment horizon and reinvestment timing.</p><p>With regard to interest rate policy, normalisation will still require a long period of time. The ECB Governing Council's forward guidance1 is definitive: ECB key interest rates will remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary. The Bundesbank still believes that it is crucial that we do not miss the most opportune moment for an interest rate reversal.</p><p>We are currently in an environment of very high excess liquidity. This is also projected to remain the case for some time to come. The deposit facility rate is therefore likely to remain the definitive Eurosystem interest rate for a while still.</p><p>The third upcoming Governing Council decision concerns refinancing. In regular refinancing operations, we currently use a fixed-rate full allotment procedure when banks request liquidity from the central bank. In 2008, the full allotment procedure was intended to support - and has since partially replaced - the money market, which had become dysfunctional. Since 2014, the Eurosystem has issued central bank loans with terms of up to four years through its targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The final longer-term refinancing operation was carried out in March 2017. This means that the TLTROs - with an amount outstanding of more than \u20ac700 billion - will reach maturity by March 2021. Excess liquidity remains high, however. Whether TLTROs will nevertheless still be needed in the future depends, amongst other factors, on how well the money market will function and how well liquidity will be redistributed across borders. The current full allocation policy remains in effect until the beginning of 2020. It is therefore certain that the ECB Governing Council will be tackling the issue of refinancing conditions in the coming year. The question is whether it will be considered necessary to extend the full allocation policy in its entirety. R\u00e9sume 1</p><p>Purchase programmes, interest rate policy, refinancing: the ECB Governing Council will soon make decisions on these issues. What measures are still required in each of these areas in terms of monetary policy? In what order and how quickly will changes be made?</p><p>Eurosystem forward guidance will continue to play a key role, ensuring that the various players will be able to adapt to changes in monetary policy in good time. In the medium term, excess liquidity must be scaled back. And policy rates should again serve as the instrument signifying the course of monetary policy. In this respect, we can learn from the experiences of Japan and the United States.</p><p>So, to summarise: we need to ensure proper communication, the phase-out will take time and will have to be done carefully, and we cannot miss the most opportune moment. 3 What will happen afterwards? Questions on the 'new normal'</p><p>If, step by step, we depart from the course of expansionary monetary policy, this raises the question of what 'normal' monetary policy actually entails. Since 2009, the phrase 'new normal' has worked its way through the financial press. The phrase was coined in 2009 by Bill Gros and Mohamed El-Erian, who at the time were managers at PIMCO. The essence of their message was that, after the Lehman collapse in the autumn of 2008, the world of finance would never again be the same as it had been prior to the crisis. Even if the phrase 'new normal' originally had a different meaning, it has since taken on a life of its own as a buzzword. It stands for the notion that we find ourselves in the midst of an upheaval. We anticipate that, after this period of transition has passed, we will enter into a new era of stability.</p><p>Central banks' unconventional monetary policy was, above all, an emergency measure. With these measures coming to an end, we are now asking ourselves what the next - hopefully stable - phase will be like.</p><p>In the academic and political discussion on future monetary policy, these questions include: what monetary policy strategies will be employed? Which monetary policy instruments will be used? And what will monetary transmission look like in the various currency areas? That said, one thing is clear: monetary policy cannot ignore long-term changes in the underlying conditions. The new world will definitely not be the same as the old one. The circumstances surrounding monetary policy - such as the structure of the financial system and banks' business models - have changed. The key questions here are: in what way and to what extent?</p><p>Discussion of the post-crisis setting in monetary policy must be accompanied by an analysis of market conditions. If we wish to be able to steer monetary policy effectively and efficiently, then we may need to respond to the new state of affairs in an appropriate way. In this context, however, we must bear in mind that this state of affairs also shows the influence of monetary policy. Central banks certainly do not want to shape the financial system according to their own inclinations. That should be left to market forces and policy makers. Instead, the financial system is the channel through which monetary policy signals and impulses are transmitted to the real economy in order to achieve our goal of price stability. That is why monetary policy is, above all, dependant on the functional viability of the financial markets. 'Work in progress' - determining the 'new normal'</p><p>As the Bundesbank Executive Board member responsible for markets, I would now like to draw your attention to several areas where the financial markets have witnessed change and are thus leaving their mark on the 'new normal': notably, money market activity, the market muscle-power of new players, fragmentation in our monetary union, the implementation of digital changes, and modifications arising from regulations. That topic, incidentally, will be discussed in more detail by Jens Weidmann in his speech tomorrow at the European BankingCongress.</p><p>Let's look first at the money market. The 2007 financial crisis caused the traditional money market to dry up, effectively rendering it dysfunctional. Since then, we have seen heightened risk aversion. Banks hold larger liquidity buffers and are less keen to source liquidity from the market. Interbank turnover has dwindled considerably in the unsecured segment and the emphasis has shifted significantly from unsecured to secured money market funds.</p><p>Step by step, central banks have taken on the tasks previously performed by the now collapsed money market, not least via the aforementioned refinancing operations, but also by instituting asset purchase programmes. This is also reflected in longer central bank balance sheets.</p><p>Parallel to this development, new players have also gained a foothold in the market. Alongside standard banks, non-banks - such as insurers or money market funds - now play an enhanced role. The structural changes to the money market also impact the reform of reference interest rates, as do the provisions contained in the EU Benchmarks Regulation. With effect from October 2019, the ECB will make its new euro overnight rate, ESTER, available, which will include transactions with non-banks. The banking sector is also currently adapting the EURIBOR to the new regulation with the aim of basing it more on actual transactions and not simply on a survey approach. These developments show that the relationship between money markets and liquidity is more complex today than before the financial crisis. Our money market is practically a new ecosystem. But that is also a reflection of our monetary policy.</p><p>A further aspect of the 'new normal' in the financial markets is the fragmentation between the member states of European monetary union. The high level of excess central bank liquidity stemming predominantly from the monetary policy purchase programmes is not really distributed, but concentrated in certain regions. This is mainly due to three factors.</p><p>First, liquidity gathers locally at financial centres. Financial centres, such as Frankfurt, are home to both national banks and banks from outside the euro area. Second, banks' different business models draw more excess liquidity to certain countries than to others. Third, the general search for 'safe haven' assets also plays a role.</p><p>Digital innovations are simultaneously changing the playing field and the rules of the game in the financial markets. In the past, monetary policy was based on the traditional banking sector. Today the terms 'bank' and 'banking business' have become more vague. The success of fintech firms, but also the growing influence of the big tech companies, is creating new conditions. They are establishing new forms of payment, trade and settlement. Fresh business ideas challenge established players with standard business models to transform and innovate. Structures and players in the financial sector change just as their business models and relative market positions do. Because this can have a significant impact on the force behind monetary policy impulses, we have to follow these developments carefully and analyse them.</p><p>In the wake of the financial crisis, regulation has altered financial markets and the money market. Particular examples that spring to mind are new provisions governing market risks, limitations on proprietary trading, and supervisory regulations effectively making many transactions more expensive. Banks are complying with the new regulatory provisions. This means that banks - in particular large banks - are scaling back their activities in the money market. It remains to be seen whether other market participants - for instance, insurers or large mutual funds - gain a role in intermediation.</p><p>A look at these five areas - the money market, new players, fragmentation, digital innovation and regulation - shows that they have all altered the financial markets - and the changes have been too many to mention here today. But one thing is clear: the new regime in the financial markets has yet to be put to a serious test over a full economic cycle. We do not yet know what further effects and changes lie ahead, even if we closely monitor the processes and circumstances. The 'new normal' in the financial markets is, as such, a 'work in progress'. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 2</p><p>In conclusion, a central bank's monetary policy has a direct impact via the financial markets, their structures and their players. This environment - monetary policy's ecosystem - has changed. And it will go on changing. Some of the changes were triggered by the financial crisis and the central banks' and regulatory authorities' crisis policies. Other changes have emerged independently and follow major trends, such as digitalisation. To ensure that monetary policy decisions are successfully implemented in the market and in the real economy, it is crucial to understand market structures. We are thus following and analysing these processes carefully.</p><p>If changes in the financial market are a 'work in progress', this ultimately means that the analysis of how monetary policy is transmitted to the financial markets is a 'work in progress', too. We are convinced that a central bank should be independent and committed solely to its objective of ensuring price stability. It should not attempt to reshape financial markets and banking beyond this remit. During the crisis, central banks stepped into the breach with their emergency measures - like it or not. Now, with the impending exit, we must engage in lively debate on controversial topics concerning fundamental issues of monetary policy. Which strategy is the most fitting? Which transmission measures are effective? Discussions have been underway in the United States for some time now, even about the mandate of the central bank.</p><p>However, we do not yet know for sure how the markets will function in the future. When discussing how monetary policy should potentially respond to changes in the markets, we thus caution against making hasty prior assumptions. This is because those parties who have previously achieved a degree of success with stability policy - and this goes for both the Eurosystem as well as the Bundesbank in the decades before - will recommend taking careful, well-thought-out steps in these discussions.

In a standard intro-econ textbook, the problem of monopolies is that because of the lack of competition, they can reduce output from what it would otherwise be, jack up prices, and thus earn higher profits. Some books also mention that monopolies may have less incentive for quality or innovation--again, because of a lack of competition. James A. Schmitz, Jr. </p><p>at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis refers to this standard intro-econ model as a \"toothless\" monopoly, because in that model, all the monopoly firm can do is raise prices. He argues that it doesn't capture what bothers most people about monopoly. There's also also a concern that monopolies take actions to take action to sabotage and even destroy their rivals--especially the rivals who might have provide low-cost competition. Moreover, monopolies may form concentrations of power with other monopolies or with with political allies to accomplish this goal, and in this way corrupt institutions of law and politics as well. Schmitz is in the middle of a substantial research project that encompasses both the intellectual history of these two views of monopoly and also a set of concrete examples. As a work-in-progress, he has posted \"Monopolies Inflict Great Harm on Low- and Middle-Income Americans\"[1] (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Staff Report No. 601, May 2020), which is nearly 400 pages long but described as the \"first essay\" in a collection of essays to be produced in the next year or two. It can usefully be read as a preliminary overview of an ongoing research project. However, it's worth noting that Schmitz doesn't focus on the conventional everyday meaning of \"monopoly\"--that is, a super-big company that dominates sales within its market. Instead, he referring to \"monopoly power\" in a way that refers to when a group (not just a single large firm) acts restrict competition. Thus, his main examples are where existing producers have exerted political power to sabotage lower-cost competitors, including residential construction, credit cards, legal services, repair services, dentistry, hearing aids, eye care, and others. Here, I'll just focus on sketching his discussion of residential construction. Schmitz writes: \"The most extensively used technology, by far, is often called the stick-built technology because sticks (two by fours) visually dominate the construction sites. Thistechnology has been used for centuries. Homes are built outside, with a highly labor-intensivetechnology. It also requires highly-skilled-labor. The other technology is factory-productionof homes. This technology substitutes capital for labor and also semi-skilled workers forhighly skilled workers.\" There has been a battle going back about a century between stick-built technology and factory technology for residential construction. Schmitz traces the early legal conflicts back to the late 1910s. Here's a summary comment from Thurman Arnold, who was Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust in the 1930s, in a 1947 article. When Arnold left the DOJ, he did not stop challenging monopolies in traditional construction.He did not stop trying to protect producers of factory-built homes. In 'Why We Havea Housing Mess,' Arnold (1947) began with a picture of a homeless Pacific War veteran,with his wife and five children, sitting on the street with their belongings (see Figure 2).The caption said: 'This Pacific War veteran and his family are homeless because we havelet rackets, chiseling and labor feather-bedding block the production of low-cost houses.'Arnold began his text this way: 'Why can't we have houses like Fords [i.e., automobiles]? For a long time, we have been hearing about mass production of marvelously efficient postwar dream houses, all manufactured in one place and distributed like Fords. Yet nothing ishappening. The low-cost mass production house has bogged down. Why? The answer isthis: When Henry Ford went into the automobile business, he had only one organization to fight [an organization with a patent] . . . But when a Henry Ford of housing tries to get intothe market with a dream house for the future, he doesn't find just one organization blockinghim. Lined up against him are a staggering series of restraints and private protective tariffs.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTS8FENEua4/XtQFPJQIcfI/AAAAAAAAKXQ/AID7H_YLTfk7RWx6MqMRnGL3SH2Q7dkVwCK4BGAsYHg/schmitz%2B1.jpgEssentially\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTS8FENEua4/XtQFPJQIcfI/AAAAAAAAKXQ/AID7H_YLTfk7RWx6MqMRnGL3SH2Q7dkVwCK4BGAsYHg/schmitz%2B1.jpgEssentially</url>, Arnold and other (including a substantial multi-author research project at the University of Chicago in the late 1940s) claimed that while no one explicitly passed rules to make factory-built housing illegal, building codes were carefully written in a way which had that effect. Some standard issues were that local building codes were different everywhere, which was fine for local stick-built construction firms, but posed a problem for a factory producer hoping to ship everywhere. There was often a distinction in building codes about living in \"trailers\" or in permanent structures, in which a \"double-wide\" home brought to the site in two parts was treated as a \"trailer,\" even when it was installed permanently on-site and looked much the same as a stick-built home of similar size. In the 1960s, economic pressure had gathered for factory-built homes, which are typically much cheaper on a per-foot basis. But in the 1970s, regulators pushed back hard, with the the newly-created US Department of Housing and Urban Development playing a big role. Here are some snippets from how Schmitz tells thestory. Many housing industry observers noted that stick-builders were facing such threats from factory-built home producers in the 1960s. Though they did not have direct measures of productivity, they compared the costs and prices of new, site-built homes to the costs and prices of other consumer durables. Alexander Pike (1967), an architect, compared the prices of new homes and the prices ofnew cars from the 1920s. Though he did not have productivity statistics, his point was clear:the productivity of construction badly lagged that of the car industry. At roughly the same time, the research department of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company(1969) wrote about this productivity divergence when discussing the potential for industrializedhousing ... in 'Factory-Built Houses: Solution for the ShelterShortage?' They noted the serious problems facing the stick built industry as its productivitylagged. They showed that, over the period 1948-68, the prices of consumer durables roseroughly 22 percent, while residential construction costs rose roughly 100 percent.Modular construction for single-family homes took off in the 1960s. Schmitz cites statistics that they \"increased from roughly 100,000 units to 600,000 units\" annually. \"The share of factory production ofsingle-family residential homes began growing in the mid 1950s, rising from about 10 percentof home production to nearly 60 percent of home production by the beginning of the 1970s(where total home production equals stick-built production plus factory production).\" But the stick-built industry, assisted by local and federal regulators, pushed back While the sabotage of factory housing has been going on for 100 years, there was a dramaticsurge in the ferocity of this sabotage in the middle 1970s. During this period, laws werepassed, and regulations implemented, that sent the factory-built housing industry into atailspin. These regulations, and additional harmful ones introduced since the 1970s, remain on the books and mean the industry is a shell of its former self. When this new sabotage was unleashed in the middle 1970s, the producers of factory homeswere well aware of it, of course. They fought the HUD and NAHB monopolies to reversethe sabotage but lost the fight. Today the members of the factory-built housing industry are unaware of this history.As Schmitz documents, the pushback came in many forms, including regulations and subsidies. As one example: Who knows how high the factory share would have risen if new sabotage of factory productionwould not have commenced in 1968. At that time, a national subsidy program was started for households buying stick-built homes (see below). Under these programs, households purchased 430,000 stick-built homes (per year) in the early 1970s.\" There have been court battles, and the \"is it a trailer, is it a house\" battle has been refought many times. For example, there is often a rule that a manufactured home must be built on a permanent and unremovable chassis--like a trailer--even though that's not what many customers would want. For those with at taste for irony, there were also complaints from stick-built construction firms that manufactured housing was \"unfair competition\" because it could be built so much less expensively. Schmitz cites estimates from the US Census Bureau in 2007 that manufactured homes are one-third the price per square foot. One suspects that if manufactured housing was encouraged and allowed to flourish, the cost advantage from economies of scale would only increase. The US economy is widely acknowledged to have a shortage of affordable housing. It has also for a century has monopolizing, competition-reducing forces that have favored more expensive stick-built housing and sabotaged the economic prospects of manufactured housing. As Schmitz points out, whatever defense one wishes to offer for these kinds of competition-restricting rules, the unavoidable fact is that the costs of the rule are carried by those of low and middle income levels, who would benefit most from lower prices.For readers who are interested in antitrust discussions as they apply to the FAGA companies (Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple), here are a couple of earlier posts that offer a starting point.\"Limits for Corporate Bigness on Acquisitions, Patents, and Politics\"[2] (August 13, 2019)\"Antitrust in the Digital Economy\"[3] (July 19, 2019)\"Three Questions for the Antitrust Moment\" [4](July 9,. 2018)\"Network Effects, Big Data, and Antitrust Issues for Big Tech\"[5](February 13, 2018) [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/monopolies-inflict-great-harm-on-low-and-middle-income-americans\">https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/monopolies-inflict-great-harm-on-low-and-middle-income-americans</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2019/08/limits-for-corporate-bigness-on.html\">https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2019/08/limits-for-corporate-bigness-on.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2019/07/antitrust-in-digital-economy.html\">https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2019/07/antitrust-in-digital-economy.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/07/three-questions-for-antitrust-moment.html\">https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/07/three-questions-for-antitrust-moment.html</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/02/network-effects-big-data-and-antitrust.html\">https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/02/network-effects-big-data-and-antitrust.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-COEC130416159102124512575776100192</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COEC-130416</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601R-XNV1-JCMN-Y0NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1788\"/><timeReceived>2:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Conversable Economist</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 1, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027Y6</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF MINNEAPOLIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

I had a great time meetingInterfacereaders last week at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay and the Conference on New Media and Democracy at Tufts University. I also made great progress on a special report I plan to have for you here before the end of the year. But enough prelude   on with today's update.</p><p> I'm one of the last people you'd expect to hear warning about the danger of conspiracies and lies,  the actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen said today in an op-ed in theWashington Post, adapted from last week's viral speech about the dangers of social networks at an Anti-Defamation League conference.</p><p>In fact, Baron Cohen is exactly the sort of person I'd expect to be warning us about social networks. As a rich celebrity who has no need for the free communication tools they provide, and who can thrive without relying on the promotional benefits that come with active use of the platforms, blasting Big Tech costs Baron Cohen nothing.</p><p>Meanwhile, few people would have ever even heard of Baron Cohen's speech had it not thrived on social media   first on Twitter, then on YouTube   where social media critiques, particularly of Facebook, have grown increasingly popular. In coming to bury the big platforms, Baron Cohen inadvertently proved their benefit: providing a wide lane for an outsider   in this case, a comedian with no previous experience as a tech pundit   to come in and start a worthwhile discussion.</p><p>To be sure, Baron Cohen raises some valuable points   and he does so with more nuance and detail than the average  Zuck sucks  Twitter egg in my mentions. (Note the way he cites academic research in his links   a welcome touch.) Baron Cohen is right, for example, about the unique danger of algorithmic recommendations on social platforms   the way they give fringe viewpoints unearned reach, and recruit followers for violent ideologies, most prominently on the far right:</p><p>The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify content that keeps users engaged   stories that appeal to our baser instincts and trigger outrage and fear. That's why fake news outperforms real news on social media; studies show lies spread faster than truth.</p><p>On the Internet, everything can appear equally legitimate. Breitbart resembles the BBC, and the rantings of a lunatic seem as credible as the findings of a Nobel Prize winner. We have lost a shared sense of the basic facts upon which democracy depends.</p><p>Baron Cohen also picks up on issue we have discussed here quite often in recent months: the fact that large technology companies, thanks to a combination of ignorance and inattention from our elected officials, are essentially accountable to no one, even as their products have unleashed dangerous, rippling butterfly effects the world over:</p><p>These super-rich  Silicon Six  care more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy. This is ideological imperialism   six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they're above the reach of law. Surely, instead of letting the Silicon Six decide the fate of the world order, our democratically elected representatives should have at least some say.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Baron Cohen's proposed solution for making tech platforms accountable is to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make Facebook and other sites legally liable for what their users post. He approvingly cites the passage last year of FOSTA-SESTA, an act nominally intended to reduce sex trafficking that was really about scrubbing sexual content off the internet. By all accounts, it has done almost nothing to reduce sex trafficking. Instead, it has forced sex workers to once again rely on abusive pimps and put themselves into unnecessary danger.</p><p>Websites reacted to the passage of FOSTA-SESTA by overreacting. Once Craigslist could be found legally liable for unwittingly hosting an ad that enabled sex trafficking, it removed all personals from its service altogether. Reddit removed several communities associated with sex work. Several sites that allowed sex workers to vet potential clients shut down entirely.</p><p>It seems likely that amending Section 230 to introduce what scholars call  intermediary liability  for Facebook et al would play out in much the same way: by over-moderating and censoring speech. In an environment in which democracy is in retreat around the world, and the internet is increasingly controlled by far-right authoritarian governments, the prospect of surging censorship in our communications tools sends a chill down my spine. How will Baron Cohen feel when a government orders the takedown of one of his satires across the entire internet? If 230 disappears, and other countries adopt similar measures, I can't imagine a likelier target.</p><p>Moreover, it's Section 230 that enables platforms to be more aggressive in pulling down hate speech and abusive content   the outcome that Baron Cohen argues for most passionately in his speech. His argument to eliminate Section 230 protections glosses right over this point, likely because Baron Cohen misunderstands what Section 230 actually does. (See also Mike Masnick on this point.)</p><p>Those qualms aside, what has stayed with me most about Baron Cohen's speech is the way it captures the new conventional wisdom among left-leaning critics: that Facebook disproportionately benefits the right wing. (Plenty of conservatives believe the exact opposite, of course.)</p><p>The thought that Facebook empowers the far right is not exactly new. Anxiety that Facebook had become a handmaiden to the conservative movement lay at the root of Cambridge Analytica blowing up into a global scandal in 2018, two years after we knew most of the details. (We knew that Facebook was sharing our data with third parties. What most of us didn't know was that third parties were using that data as part of sophisticated, micro-targeted political influence campaigns.)</p><p>But there is new evidence of Facebook's material support of the right wing. In theWall Street Journalthis weekend, Deepa Seetharaman profiled James Barnes, who Facebook once embedded in the Trump campaign to help officials there use the company's advertising platform. Barnes, who like a growing number of former Facebook employees experienced a crisis of conscience over the work he did there, revealed that the company had made unusual arrangements to ensure Trump could buy the maximum amount of ads.</p><p>The profile lays out the extraordinary amount of assistance that Facebook lent Trump. In theory, the same amount of assistance was available to Hillary Clinton, but she declined. Barnes hand-coded custom advertising tools for Trump, ran split tests on advertising copy to see which would be most effective, and offered troubleshooting help whenever asked during what he describes as 12-hour days working on the campaign. He also ensured the company could access a larger line of credit than Facebook had ever previously extended:</p><p>The Trump campaign needed a large credit line from Facebook, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the situation. This issue posed special challenges. Facebook sometimes extends credit to a select group of digital agencies, but Mr. Parscale's outfit didn't qualify for a large line because it didn't have a track record with Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter. The Trump team also wanted to pay for ads with a credit card, but Facebook's transactions system wasn't set up to handle payments of as much as $300,000 to $400,000 a day on a credit card, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the matter.</p><p>As employees looked for ways to address the problem, Mr. Parscale texted Mr. Barnes to say Mr. Trump would go on TV and  say Facebook was being unfair to him  if the issue wasn't resolved quickly, Mr. Barnes said. Eventually, Facebook came up with a fix.</p><p>Of course, it's possible that Facebook bent over backwards for Trump for simple reasons of self-preservation. In an environment where regulation seems increasingly likely, a corporation will naturally seek to make nice with any potential nemesis.</p><p>Still, the scope of Facebook's aid to the Trump campaign is surprising. And it gives credence to one of the arguments made forcefully by Baron Cohen: that social networks have been far more successful at empowering dangerous reactionaries than they have more progressive forces.</p><p>In most ways, 2019 was a stellar year for Facebook's business. (Alex Heath has a nice [paywalled!] overview here.) But it was a bad year for Facebook's reputation. And until the company is held accountable for the misuses of its products in some meaningful way, it's hard to see how that will improve. I only hope that when regulation comes, policymakers come up with better solutions than Baron Cohen did.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>changed its political ad policy last week to limit the ways in which politicians can target potential voters.

Baron Cohen said big tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google facilitate the spread of hate speech and lies, making up \"the greatest propaganda machine in history.\" He said the internet treats 'the rantings of a lunatic' as equal to statements made by a Nobel Prize winner, essentially killing the idea of shared, basic facts that everyone agrees on. Although the speech criticised big tech as a whole, Baron Cohen went after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in particular. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] \"Borat\" actor Sacha Baron Cohen launched a full-throated attack against tech companies for allowing hate speech to proliferate on their platforms in a 25-minute speech to the Anti-Defamation League[2] on Thursday night. Baron Cohen said a \"handful of internet companies\" are facilitating what he called \"the greatest propaganda machine in history.\" Although Baron Cohen mentioned Google, Twitter, and Facebook in his speech, his sharpest criticism was reserved for Mark Zuckerberg. Baron Cohen referred back to a speech Zuckerberg gave at Georgetown University last month[3] outlining where he thinks Facebook should draw the line on regulating free speech on its platform. Baron Cohen dismantled Zuckerberg's speech point-by-point. \"First, Zuckerberg tried to portray this whole issue as 'choices around free expression.' That is ludicrous. This is not about limiting anyone's free speech. This is about giving people, including some of the most reprehensible people on earth, the biggest platform in history to reach a third of the planet. Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach,\" he said. The comedian added that the First Amendment prevents the government from limiting free expression, but private companies have control over what they allow. \"If a neo-Nazi comes goose-stepping into a restaurant and starts threatening other customers and saying he wants kill Jews, would the owner of the restaurant be required to serve him an elegant eight-course meal? Of course not. The restaurant owner has every legal right and a moral obligation to kick the Nazi out, and so do these internet companies,\" he said.Baron Cohen also took issue with Zuckerberg's stance on Holocaust-denial[4]. In an interview with Kara Swisher last year Zuckerberg said although he finds Holocaust denial \"deeply offensive\" he won't remove it from Facebook because it could be someone's sincerely held belief. \"I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong,\" he said. \"We have millions of pieces of evidence for the Holocaust \u2014 it is an historical fact. And denying it is not some random opinion. Those who deny the Holocaust aim to encourage another one,\" Baron Cohen said. Baron Cohen also criticized Facebook over its decision to allow political ads on its platform even if they contain misinformation[5]. \"Fortunately, Twitter finally banned [political ads], and Google is making changes, too. But if you pay them, Facebook will run any 'political' ad you want, even if it's a lie,\" he said. Baron Cohen made the suggestion that social media platforms should not immediately publish content and give themselves more time to scrutinize posts. \"The shooter who massacred Muslims in New Zealand livestreamed his atrocity on Facebook where it then spread across the internet and was viewed likely millions of times. It was a snuff film, brought to you by social media. Why can't we have more of a delay so this trauma-inducing filth can be caught and stopped before it's posted in the first place?\" Facebook rejected the idea that a time-delay could be placed on streamed videos[6] following the Christchurch shooting, saying it would only serve to slow down Facebook's response to violent content even more. Baron Cohen also floated the idea that the internet's treatment of 'the rantings of a lunatic' as equally credible to statements made by 'a Nobel Prize winner' meant a reduction in shared, basic facts that everyone agrees on. \"Democracy, which depends on shared truths, is in retreat, and autocracy, which depends on shared lies, is on the march,\" he said. Giving some quarter, Baron Cohen said tech companies had made some attempts to combat bigotry on their platforms but that the measures taken have been \"largely superficial.\" \"When discussing the difficulty of removing content, Zuckerberg asked 'Where do you draw the line?' Yes, drawing the line can be difficult. But here's what he's really saying: removing more of these lies and conspiracies is just too expensive,\" he said. \"If these internet companies really want to make a difference, they should hire enough monitors to actually monitor, work closely with groups like the ADL, insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms,\" he added. He also called for stricter regulation to allow the government to hold tech companies to account. As the situation stands however, Baron Cohen said while the tech firms remain unregulated tech CEOs can exert a kind of \"ideological imperialism.\" \"It's like we're living in the Roman Empire, and Mark Zuckerberg is Caesar. At least that would explain his haircut,\" he said. (Zuckerberg's haircut has been the subject of some speculation[7].)You can watch Sacha Baron Cohen's full speech here: Youtube Embed: //<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ymaWq5yZIYM\">www.youtube.com/embed/ymaWq5yZIYM</url> Width: 800px Height: 450px NOW WATCH: How autopilot on an airplane works[8]See Also: Amnesty says Google and Facebook threaten human rights[9]Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had an undisclosed dinner with Trump and Peter Thiel at the White House[10]Mark Zuckerberg's sharp criticism of China is reportedly not going down too well with Facebook's base of Chinese employees[11] SEE ALSO:Facebook refuses to fact-check political ads, and it's infuriating employees and lawmakers.

A vital, open Internet where everyone can participate and no company can discriminate, censor or manipulate our data is the right goal - but this is the wrong way to get there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have worked for years to protect and expand the public's access to the airwaves and to give the unheard a voice. I run Crossings TV, an Asian language network dedicated to providing an outlet for growing but underserved communities in our state. </p><p>But this commitment has deeper roots, from my childhood growing up as an African American in the '50s, when a person of color on TV was as unheard of as a Republican-controlled California Legislature is today. And I continued working on these issues in the Carter White House, where we created the Minority Tax Certificate, which tripled the number of minority-owned broadcast and cable TV outlets, and at the FCC, where we planted the first seeds of the breakup of AT&amp;T to give Americans more choice in their communications.</p><p>From these experiences, I can see that the California net neutrality plan will fail because it will be struck down in the courts. Even the most active champions of net neutrality recognize this, like the legal counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation who <url normalizedValue=\"http://wrote\">wrote</url>: \"The legislators sadly chose an approach that is vulnerable to legal attack.\" This is because the federal government has already \"pre-empted\" state efforts to directly regulate the Internet.</p><p>But even if the California bill could survive, the true test is in the marketplace. Again and again, well-meaning bills like this one nevertheless spin off unintended consequences that are self-defeating in terms of higher costs and/or lower innovation.</p><p>There is only one Internet - a seamless, organic, interconnected whole that respects no state boundaries and requires one consistent set of technical and legal standards to operate. California cannot stop emails at the border and scan them for compliance with the whims of Sacramento. And privacy protection is only as good as its weakest link - so no matter how strong the go-it-alone rules we enact in our state may be, they'll mean nothing if Nevada or some other state adopts a Wild West approach and leaks our information when it passes through that state.</p><p>Internet businesses cannot comply with 50 different versions of \"net neutrality.\" The result will be higher costs for consumers, slower innovation of our networks, and an inward-looking Internet that worries more about navigating red tape than connecting and empowering our people.</p><p>Even worse - these rules will only empower the near-monopoly platforms that already dominate a space that has too little competition. Small upstarts can't afford the legal and compliance teams needed to survive that kind of regulatory obstacle, but Facebook and Google can. </p><p>Or at least they could if the proposed rules even applied to them. And that's the biggest gap of all in California's legislation - the rules completely exempt the Big Tech platforms that are responsible for so much abuse and anticompetitive behavior online. </p><p>Everyone now understands that these platforms must be reined in. Yet the California rules give these platforms a hall pass and then further distort the market by imposing inconsistent regulation on their competitors only.</p><p>We need one set of comprehensive rules for the entire Internet.

At the same time, companies affected by the new  trans-Atlantic data-sharing regime are complaining that they are in the dark about their obligations under Privacy Shield and are getting mixed messages from officials charged with enforcing the new rules.</p><p>This week, the European Commission's justice commissioner (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/us-europe-reach-deal-safe-harbor-20-critics-say-transatlantic-data-still-vulnerable-2289980\">http://www.ibtimes.com/us-europe-reach-deal-safe-harbor-20-critics-say-transatlantic-data-still-vulnerable-2289980</url>) announced that a deal had been struck on how data, from sources ranging from social networks and e-commerce sites to mobile networks, must be handled stateside to protect Europeans' privacy. It was an 11th-hour pact to replace Safe Harbor, which was voided last year by Europe's high court.</p><p>But European and American officials have yet to provide full details on the new rules, and those affected have been left trying to make sense of what it means for them. </p><p>The big tech companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are remaining tight-lipped about the situation while smaller businesses are left to worry about the potential for big fines as the individual data protection authorities charged with enforcing the law seem as confused about what to do next as the companies themselves.</p><p>The uncertainty extends to the Federal Trade Commission, which took part in the negotiations. On Thursday, Commissioner Julie Brill said she understood European data authorities will not bring enforcement actions against any company continuing to use the invalid Safe Harbor mechanism, until Privacy Shield is fully in place.</p><p>\"My understanding is that [the European data authorities] are holding in abeyance enforcement actions while they undergo these evaluations,\" Brill said Thursday.</p><p>But 24 hours earlier, a senior European official made it clear that this was not the case. If a company \"is using the former Safe Harbor, this company is in an illegal situation,\" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, chairwoman of the Article 29 Working Group - which comprises the data protection authorities of each of the 28 EU member states - said Wednesday.</p><p>\"There is one thing that is for sure: If these companies are using the former Safe Harbor framework, it is illegal because this has been clearly invalidated by the judge,\" Falque-Pierrotin said.</p><p>The confusion dates back to last October, when the European Court of Justice ruled that the 16-year-old Safe Harbor mechanism for transferring data - everything from your Facebook posts to employee payroll information - from Europe to the U.S. was invalid, claiming that revelations by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden suggested European Union citizens' data were not safe from mass surveillance by American authorities.</p><p>On Tuesday, after months of negotiations and the official deadline of Jan. 31 having passed, the European Commission announced it had reached an agreement with U.S. negotiators. The EC said the pact calls for more transparency on how U.S. intelligence agencies access EU citizens' data, the appointment of an independent ombudsman to oversee data transfers and an annual consultation process to assess how well Privacy Shield is working.</p><p>EC Commissioner Vera JourovAaAaAeA called it \"a strong and sa framework for the future of trans-Atlantic data flows,\" adding that it will live up to the Court of Justice ruling. \"We will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments they've made,\" she said.</p><p>But Wednesday, Falque-Pierrotin indicated that Privacy Shield is far from the panacea some claim it to be. \"[We] still need to receive these documents in order to know precisely the content and also the legal bindingness of these announcements,\" she said during a press conference. \"Because until now we have been told it is an exchange of letters, a unilateral act from the commission; we don't know exactly what it covers.\"</p><p>The commission has agreed to present a final document to a working group within three weeks. It will then have to be agreed on by what is known as the College of Commissioners, made up of commissioners from all 28 member states. Crucially, however, this will happen only after the commissioners obtain the advice of the Article 29 Working Party and after consulting a committee comprising representatives of the member states.</p><p>Fines and penalties for violating Privacy Shield differ depending on what country the data were transferred from,  with Ireland having a maximum fine of 250,000 euros ($280,000), while Germany's data authority can fine up to 300,000 euros.</p><p>Safe Harbor was not the only mechanism for transferring data legally across the Atlantic - it was just the easiest. Companies could also use what are known as binding corporate rules (BCRs) or standard contract clauses (SCCs), but both of these are complex legal constructs and require significant time and resources to put in place. Therefore, for the majority of the 4,400 companies that relied on Safe Harbor, these alternatives were simply not an option.</p><p>So with Safe Harbor invalidated, alternatives simply too onerous to implement and the details of Privacy Shield still to be finalized, it's unclear whether thousands of companies potentially still using Safe Harbor are going to face enforcement actions. </p><p>International Business Times contacted the data protection authorities of all 28 EU member states asking if they will act against companies still using Safe Harbor. From the replies, it is clear that even those tasked with implementing these laws are unclear about what to do.</p><p>France's Commission national de l'informatique et des liberties - of which Falque-Pterrotin is head - said it is already investigating some companies about which it has received complaints and \"will decide whether or not to use its enforcement powers, according to its national law.\"</p><p>Conversely, Viljar Peep, director general of the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate, said: \"I am not going to take enforcement actions against enterprises who were using invalidated Safe Harbor - until the moment when the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will be available for them.\"</p><p>Merkel Wilander, spokesperson for the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said the body is taking a similar wait-and-see approach. \"We will not take enforcement actions until we have ended our analysis.\" Matthias Schmidl, deputy head of the Austrian Data Protection Authority, was more vague about what the next steps will be, saying it \"is by law obliged to initiate proceedings if it finds out that data are transferred to the U.S. in violation of the Austrian Data Protection Act.\"</p><p>Hans-Olof Lindblom, chief legal advisor for the Swedish Data Protection Authority, was more straightforward: \"The Swedish Data Protection Authority is for the moment not taking any such action.\" The U.K.'s regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, pointed IBT in the direction of a blog written in October by David Smith, then deputy commissioner but who is no longer with the ICO: \"Our initial message is still valid. Don't panic and don't rush to other transfer mechanisms that may turn out to be less than ideal.\"</p><p>'We Don't Know a Lot About This'</p><p>Aside from France, Austria, Sweden, Estonia, the UK and the Netherlands, none of the other 22 data protection authorities immediately responded to queries about its plans, suggesting there remains significant confusion among those at the center of this debate.</p><p>\"The legal format of the arrangement is still unclear for us,\" Falque-Pterrotin said Wednesday in a press conference in Brussels. \"I heard [the term] 'exchange of letters,' but to be honest, we don't know a lot about this.\"</p><p>So why was Privacy Shield announced if there is so little concrete detail about what the new mechanism entails? \"What we actually have here is a desperate PR effort to buy more time before the EU Commission and the U.S. have to face the consequences of the legal incompatibility between the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and the U.S.' commitment to mass surveillance,\" Simon McGarr, an Irish lawyer specializing in internet protocol and law, said.</p><p>McGarr's assertion is backed up by Ian McEwan, head of European operations for cloud storage company Egnyte. \"There had to be something put in place [because] of the economic pressures,\" McEwan told IBT. \"The transatlantic consumer-based business is huge.\"</p><p>The ruling in October invalidating Safe Harbor has led to a change in the way some companies are operating. McEwan said some of his customers are already asking for data not to leave Europe, while at least one German customer has asked that its customer data don't leave the country.</p><p>Thousands of small and midsize businesses remain in limbo. They face a choice between investing considerable time and money into creating BCRs and SCCs or waiting until Privacy Shield comes online - which according to the timeline set out by Falque-Pterrotin won't be until late April at the earliest.</p><p>As well as all the smaller companies, the invalidation of Safe Harbor has had an impact on the big multinationals, particularly those whose core currency is data. Companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook all declined to comment on the situation. Microsoft pointed to tweets by its senior counsel Brad Smith - the man who last month called the negotiations \"(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQF8319hc8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2356\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQF8319hc8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2356</url>) too important to fail .\"</p><p/><p>Privacy Shield may also become the subject of litigation. \"There will likely be legal challenges,\" said Kendall Burman, a former White House advisor and currently a data privacy counselor at the Mayer Brown law firm.</p><p>One challenge could come from the man responsible for bringing down Safe Harbor in the first place, Max Schrems. Schrems successfully sued California-based Facebook in European court, complaining the social network failed to protect his privacy. That ultimately led to the high court striking down Safe Harbor.</p><p>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf\">http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf</url>) Responding to the Privacy Shield announcement , the Austrian Ph.D. student said it was too early for a final assessment, but he expects the whole thing could end up in court. \"I am not sure if this system will stand the test before the Court of Justice. There will be clearly people that will challenge this - depending on the final text, I may well be one of them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-518625157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 518625157</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5T-0NM1-DYTM-927D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 IBT Media, formerly dba International Business Times</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 5, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Consumer Protection Laws</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

At the same time, companies affected by the new trans-Atlantic data-sharing regime are complaining that they are in the dark about their\u00a0obligations under Privacy Shield and are getting mixed messages from officials charged with enforcing the new rules. This week,\u00a0the European Commission's\u00a0justice\u00a0commissioner announced that\u00a0a deal had been struck[1] on how data, from sources\u00a0ranging from\u00a0social networks and e-commerce sites to mobile networks, must be handled stateside to protect Europeans' privacy. It was an 11th-hour pact to replace Safe Harbor, which was voided last year by Europe's high court. </p><p>But European and American officials have yet to provide full details on the new rules, and those affected\u00a0have been\u00a0left trying to\u00a0make sense of what it means for them.\u00a0 The big tech companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are remaining tight-lipped about the situation while smaller\u00a0businesses are left to worry about the potential for big fines as\u00a0the individual\u00a0data protection authorities charged with enforcing the law seem as confused about what to do next as the companies themselves. The\u00a0uncertainty extends to the Federal Trade Commission, which took part in the negotiations. On Thursday, Commissioner Julie Brill said she understood European data authorities will not bring enforcement actions\u00a0against\u00a0any company continuing to use\u00a0the invalid Safe Harbor\u00a0mechanism, until Privacy Shield is fully in place. \"My understanding is that [the European data authorities] are holding in abeyance enforcement actions while they undergo these evaluations,\" Brill said Thursday. But 24 hours earlier,\u00a0a senior European official\u00a0made it clear that this was not the case. If a company \"is using the former Safe Harbor, this company is in an illegal situation,\" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin,\u00a0chairwoman of the Article 29 Working Group \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0comprises the data protection authorities of each of the 28 EU member states \u2014\u00a0said Wednesday. 'There is one thing that is for sure: If these companies are using the former Safe Harbor framework, it is illegal because this has been clearly invalidated by the judge,'\u00a0Falque-Pierrotin\u00a0said.  Privacy Shield is the deal struck between the U.S. and EU as a mechanism for facilitating the legal transfer of data across the Atlantic. Photo: European Union The confusion dates back to last\u00a0October, when the European Court of Justice ruled that the\u00a016-year-old Safe Harbor mechanism for transferring data \u2014\u00a0everything from your Facebook posts to employee payroll information \u2014\u00a0from Europe to the U.S. was invalid, claiming that revelations by National Security Agency\u00a0whistleblower Edward Snowden suggested European Union\u00a0citizens' data were not safe from mass surveillance by American authorities. On Tuesday, after months of negotiations and the official deadline of Jan.\u00a031 having passed, the European Commission announced it had\u00a0reached an agreement with U.S. negotiators.\u00a0The EC said the pact calls for\u00a0more transparency on how U.S. intelligence agencies access\u00a0EU citizens'\u00a0data, the appointment of an independent ombudsman to oversee data transfers and an\u00a0annual consultation process\u00a0to assess how well Privacy Shield\u00a0is working. EC Commissioner\u00a0Vera Jourov\u00e1 called it \"a\u00a0strong and safe framework\u00a0for the future of trans-Atlantic data flows,' adding that it will live up to the Court of Justice ruling. \"We will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments they've made,\" she\u00a0said. But Wednesday, Falque-Pierrotin\u00a0indicated that Privacy Shield is far from the panacea some claim\u00a0it to be. '[We] still need to receive these documents in order to know precisely the content and also the legal bindingness of these announcements,'\u00a0she said during a press conference. 'Because until now we have been told it is an exchange of letters, a unilateral act from the commission; we don't know exactly what it covers.' The commission has agreed to present a\u00a0final document to a working group within three weeks. It will then have to be agreed on by what is known as the College of Commissioners, made up of commissioners from all 28 member states. Crucially, however, this will happen only\u00a0after the commissioners\u00a0obtain\u00a0the advice of the Article 29 Working Party and after consulting a committee comprising\u00a0representatives of the member states. Fines and penalties for violating Privacy Shield differ depending on what\u00a0country the data were\u00a0transferred from, with Ireland having a maximum fine of 250,000 euros ($280,000), while Germany's data authority can fine up to 300,000 euros. Safe Harbor was not the only mechanism for transferring data legally across the Atlantic \u2014\u00a0it was just the easiest. Companies could also use what are known as binding corporate rules (BCRs) or standard contract clauses (SCCs), but both of these are complex legal constructs and require significant time and resources to put in place. Therefore, for the majority of the 4,400 companies that\u00a0relied on Safe Harbor, these alternatives were simply not an option.  A case brought against Facebook by Austrian data activist Max Schrems, shown here talking to the media in 2015, led to the Safe Harbor agreement being struck down by the European Court of Justice. Photo: Reuters So with Safe Harbor invalidated, alternatives simply too onerous to implement and the details of Privacy Shield still to be finalized, it's unclear whether\u00a0thousands of companies potentially still using Safe Harbor are going to face enforcement actions.\u00a0 International Business Times contacted the data protection authorities of all 28 EU member states asking if they will\u00a0act against companies still using Safe Harbor. From the replies, it is clear that even those tasked with implementing these laws are unclear about what to do. France's Commission national de l'informatique et des liberties\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of which Falque-Pterrotin is head \u2014\u00a0said it is\u00a0already investigating some companies about which it has received complaints and 'will decide whether or not to use its enforcement powers, according to its national law.' Conversely, Viljar Peep, director general of the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate, said:\u00a0'I am not going to take enforcement actions against enterprises who were using invalidated Safe Harbor \u2014\u00a0until the moment when the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will be available for them.' Merkel Wilander, spokesperson for the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said the body is taking\u00a0a similar wait-and-see approach. 'We will not take enforcement actions until we have ended our analysis.' Matthias Schmidl,\u00a0deputy head of the Austrian Data Protection Authority,\u00a0was more vague about what the next steps will be, saying\u00a0it \"is\u00a0by law obliged to initiate proceedings if it finds out that data are transferred to the U.S. in violation of the Austrian Data Protection Act.\" Hans-Olof Lindblom, chief legal advisor for the\u00a0Swedish Data Protection Authority, was more straightforward: \"The Swedish Data Protection Authority is for the moment not taking any such action.\" The U.K.'s regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, pointed IBT in the direction of a blog written in October by David Smith, then deputy commissioner but who is no longer with the ICO: \"Our initial message is still valid. Don't panic and don't rush to other transfer mechanisms that may turn out to be less than ideal.\" 'We Don't Know a Lot About This' Aside from France, Austria, Sweden,\u00a0Estonia, the UK and the Netherlands, none of the other 22\u00a0data protection authorities immediately responded to queries about its\u00a0plans, suggesting there\u00a0remains\u00a0significant confusion among those at the center of this debate. 'The legal format of the arrangement is still unclear for us,' Falque-Pterrotin said Wednesday\u00a0in a press conference in Brussels. 'I heard [the term] 'exchange of letters,' but to be honest, we don't know a lot about this.' So why was Privacy Shield announced if there is so little concrete detail about what the new mechanism entails? 'What we actually have here is a desperate PR effort to buy more time before the EU Commission and the U.S. have to face the consequences of the legal incompatibility between the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and the U.S.' commitment to mass surveillance,' Simon McGarr, an Irish lawyer specializing in\u00a0internet protocol\u00a0and law,\u00a0said. McGarr's assertion is backed up by Ian McEwan, head of European operations for cloud storage company Egnyte. \"There had to be something put in place [because] of the economic pressures,\" McEwan told IBT. \"The transatlantic consumer-based business is huge.\" The ruling in October invalidating Safe Harbor has led to a change in the way some companies are operating.\u00a0McEwan said some of his customers are already\u00a0asking for data not to leave Europe, while at least one German customer has asked that its customer data don't leave the country. Thousands of small and midsize businesses\u00a0remain in limbo. They face a choice between\u00a0investing considerable time and money into creating BCRs and SCCs or\u00a0waiting until Privacy Shield comes online \u2014\u00a0which according to the timeline set out by Falque-Pterrotin\u00a0won't be until late April at the earliest. As well as all the smaller companies, the invalidation of Safe Harbor has had an impact on the big multinationals, particularly those whose core currency is data. Companies like Google, Apple, Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook all declined to comment on the situation. Microsoft pointed to\u00a0tweets by its senior counsel Brad Smith \u2014\u00a0the man who last month called the negotiations \"too important\u00a0to fail[2].\" We're grateful for the difficult work by both EU and U.S. officials to address this important issue. \u2014 Brad Smith (@BradSmi) February 2, 2016[3]  Privacy Shield may also become the subject of litigation. \"There will likely be legal challenges,\" said Kendall\u00a0Burman, a former White House advisor and currently a\u00a0data privacy counselor at the\u00a0Mayer Brown law firm. One challenge\u00a0could come from the man responsible for bringing down Safe Harbor in the first place, Max Schrems. Schrems successfully sued California-based Facebook in European court, complaining the social network failed to protect his privacy. That ultimately led to the high court striking down Safe Harbor. Responding to the Privacy Shield announcement[4], the Austrian Ph.D. student said it was too early for a final assessment, but he expects the whole thing could end up in court. \"I am\u00a0not sure if this system will stand the test before the Court of Justice. There will be clearly people that will challenge this \u2014\u00a0depending on the final text, I may well be one of them.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/us-europe-reach-deal-safe-harbor-20-critics-say-transatlantic-data-still-vulnerable-2289980\">http://www.ibtimes.com/us-europe-reach-deal-safe-harbor-20-critics-say-transatlantic-data-still-vulnerable-2289980</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQF8319hc8...ture=youtu.be...356\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQF8319hc8...ture=youtu.be...356</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/694572295751217155\">https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/694572295751217155</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf\">http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767145468925527525176100076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J18-2FX1-F03R-N3JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1871\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 5, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Luckily, I suffered only a couple bruised ribs and some road rash. But ever since, I have felt my pulse rise when I hear a car coming up behind my bike. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As self-driving cars roll out, they're already being billed as making me -- and <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/self-driving-car-safety/\">millions of American cyclists</url>, pedestrians and vehicle passengers -- safer. </p><p>As a driver and a cyclist, I initially welcomed the idea of self-driving cars that could detect nearby people and <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/finding-trust-and-understanding-in-autonomous-technologies-70245\">be programmed not to hit them</url>, making the streets safer for everyone. Autonomous vehicles also seemed to provide attractive ways to use roads more efficiently and reduce the need for parking in our communities. People are certainly talking about how       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/95/\">self-driving cars could help build more sustainable</url>, livable, walkable and bikable communities. </p><p>But as an urban planner and <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kNoHPjEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">transportation scholar</url> who, like most people in my field, has paid close attention to the discussion around driverless cars, I have come to understand that autonomous vehicles will not complement modern urban planning goals of building people-centered communities. In fact, I think they're mutually exclusive: We can have a world of safe, efficient, driverless cars, or we can have a world where people can walk, bike and take transit in high-quality, human-scaled communities. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changing Humans' Behavior</emphasis></p><p>These days, with human-driven cars all over the place, I choose my riding routes and behavior carefully: I much prefer to ride on low-speed traffic, low-traffic roads, <url normalizedValue=\"https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bike-lanes/buffered-bike-lanes/\">buffered bike lanes</url> or off-street bike paths whenever possible, even if it means going substantially out of my way. That's because I'm scared of what a human driver -- through error, ignorance, inattention or even malice -- might do to me on tougher roads. </p><p>But in a hypothetical future in which all cars are autonomous, maybe I'll make different choices? So long as I'm confident self-driving cars will at least try to avoid killing me on my bike, I'll take the most direct route to my destination, on roads that I consider much too dangerous to ride on today. I won't need to worry about drivers because the technology will protect me. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/the-big-problem-with-selfdriving-cars-is-people\">Driverless cars will level the playing field</url>: I'll finally be able to ride where I am comfortable in a lane, rather than in the gutter -- and pedal at a comfortable speed for myself rather than racing to keep up with, or get out of the way of, other riders or vehicles. I can even see riding with my kids on roads, instead of driving somewhere safe to ride like a park (of course, this is all still assuming driverless cars will eventually figure out       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html\">how to avoid killing cyclists</url>). </p><p>To bikers and people interested in vibrant communities, this sounds great. I'm sure I won't be the only cyclist who makes these choices. But that actually becomes a problem. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Tragedy of the Commons</emphasis></p><p>In the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/lincolncitynebraska\">midsize midwestern college town</url> I call home, estimates suggest       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://journalstar.com/news/local/taking-it-to-the-streets-city-wants-help-from-cyclists/article_920dab95-f555-5c13-9b63-3ef8f7689dd8.html\">about 4,000 people commute by bike</url>.

Some might even try to <url normalizedValue=\"https://jalopnik.com/heres-how-to-prank-autonomous-cars-when-they-come-874123410\">disrupt the flow of traffic</url> by walking back and forth in the road or even just standing and texting,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-pedestrians-will-defeat-autonomous-vehicles/\">confident the cars will not hit them</url>. It's easy to see how good driverless cars will enable people to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/11/how-driverless-cars-could-empower-pedestrians/506132/\">enjoy those previously terrifying streets</url>, but it also demonstrates that safety for people and efficiency for cars can't happen at the same time. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">People Versus Cars</emphasis></p><p>It's not hard to imagine a situation where driverless cars can't get anywhere efficiently -- except late at night or early in the morning. That's the sort of problem policy scholars enjoy working on, trying to engineer ways for people and technology to get along better. </p><p>One proposed solution would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/14/street-wars-2035-cyclists-driverless-cars-autonomous-vehicles\">put cars and bicycles on different areas of the streets</url>, or transform certain streets into \"autonomous only\" thoroughfares. But I question the logic of undertaking massive road-building projects when many cities today       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/cash-strapped-towns-un-paving-roads-cant-afford-fix/\">struggle to afford basic maintenance of their existing streets</url>. </p><p>An alternative could be to simply make new rules governing how people should behave around autonomous vehicles. Similar rules exist already: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bikeleague.org/StateBikeLaws\">Bikes aren't allowed on most freeways</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/pedestrian-crossing-50-state-summary.aspx\">jaywalking is illegal</url> across most of the U.S.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/to-get-ready-for-robot-driving-some-want-to-reprogram-pedestrians\">Regulating people instead of cars</url> would be cheaper than designing and building new streets. It would also help work around some of the technical problems of teaching driverless cars to avoid every possible danger -- or even just       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/the-selfdriving-cars-bicycle-problem\">learning to recognize bicycles</url> in the first place. </p><p>However, telling people what they can and can't do in the streets raises a key problem. In vibrant communities, roads are public property, which everyone can use for transportation, of course -- but also for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/us/california-today-street-vending-legal.html\">commerce</url>, civil discourse and even       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/13/why-highways-have-become-the-center-of-civil-rights-protest/\">civil disobedience</url>. Most of the U.S., however, appears to have implicitly decided that streets are primarily for moving cars quickly from one place to another. </p><p>There might be an argument for driverless cars in rural areas, or for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/10/self-driving-cars-are-going-to-beat-up-on-trains-too/502430/\">intercity travel</url>, but in cities, if driverless cars merely replace human-driven vehicles, then communities won't change much, or they may become even more car-dependent. If people choose to prioritize road safety over all other factors, that will shift how people use roads, sidewalks and other public ways. But then autonomous vehicles will never be particularly efficient or convenient. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article was written by Daniel Piatkowski, assistant professor of community and regional planning at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, for The Conversation.

He demands companies block child abuse material as soon as it's uploaded; stop online grooming; shut down livestreaming of abuse; better co-operate with law enforcement, and increase transparency and share best practice within industry. Sounds good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These demands indicate that government is moving in the right direction. It is vital that it does not falter.

Much focus has been on taking down images or videos of abuse, which is a vital part of tackling online child sexual abuse. But this is not enough. Once abuse has been documented on camera, harm has already been done. Lives have been ruined. Preventing abuse from happening in the first place is what urgently needs to happen.</p><p>NSPCC research shows that every day there are an average of nine offences of Sexual Communication with a Child in England and Wales alone. That means there could be more than 1,000 more offences recorded by Christmas. Legislation must force social networks to apply technology to detect grooming to stop abuse before it escalates.</p><p>Even if huge corporations take action to stop abuse from happening, children must be protected wherever they are online. In the last year a total of 80 different platforms were recorded by police in England and Wales as being used to send sexual messages to children. That is why we need a regulator that can hold all social networks, big and small, to a minimum set of safety standards and to uphold a duty of care to their young users. And that regulator must have teeth.</p><p>To properly tackle abuse, social networks must be forced to tell us the scale of abuse on their sites. Via annual transparency reports we need to know how many child users they have, how many child endangerment reports they receive, how those reports are dealt with and how swiftly they are dealt with. These reports will mean parents can see which sites are taking child protection seriously, and will shame underperforming sites into action.</p><p>I have written to Mr Javid welcoming the fact he has made it his personal mission to tackle online child sexual exploitation and end the Wild West Web. The NSPCC stands ready to help in any way it can. We have a fantastic opportunity to stop abuse where it starts, and to ensure the sites children love are safe from the moment they log on. This must be the moment our nation stands up to tech giants for the safety of our children.</p><p>Peter Wanless is chief executive of the NSPCC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-47158269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7B-0FT1-F021-613M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><timeReceived>5:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

As one Silicon Valley investor put it, we are their fuel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least our personal data is: every week, it seems, we are treated to fresh revelations of hacks, leaks and exploitation of our information, along with ever louder cries for regulation and consumer protection, in the US and Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is less appreciated is the degree to which Apple and Amazon.com - which must maintain a direct relationship with their paying customers - could also be affected, both for good and for ill. (Another tech giant, Microsoft, hasn't played as big a role in the smartphone revolution and hasn't seen similar growth, but it too must comply with forthcoming regulation.) The past decade saw an explosion in revenue and value for these four companies sufficient to put them atop the global economy. But the laissez-faire environment in which they have operated is for the first time plausibly coming to an end.</p><p>Facebook is the lightning rod: across the political spectrum, statements by public figures and recent surveys reveal Americans are suddenly more concerned about the power of Facebook. Possibilities that seemed remote just six months ago, such as action by state Attorneys-General, are now reality. Missouri's Attorney-General is demanding Facebook say which political campaigns paid for users' personal data and whether users were notified.</p><p>In Europe, strict privacy regulations known as the General Data Protection Regulation come into force on May 25.</p><p>GDPR is designed to include penalties that are \"effective and dissuasive\". Depending on the offence - including mishandling of personal data, failure to exclude children from age-inappropriate services or content and many others - fines can be as high as 4 per cent of a company's global -revenue. Based on 2017 revenue, for Facebook that could be $US1.6 billion ($2.5bn).</p><p>And as GDPR rules could cover EU citizens no matter where they live or travel, multinational companies may not be able to simply fence off their services geographically. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg recently said his company was working on extending GDPR protections to every user.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg also recently said that regulation of companies like Facebook was inevitable, and that he supported mandating that internet companies label political advertising, something the company has already pledged to do.</p><p>This is on top of the EU's parallel effort to force US tech giants to change how their services work on antitrust grounds, which is inspiring politicians in the US.</p><p>The recent bipartisan passage of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which potentially opens up all online services to liability for facilitating human trafficking, was a blow to tech's decades of legal immunity. Calls for more industry-wide regulation are coming from many quarters, and rumblings of legislative action are now coming from Big Tech's former allies.</p><p>\"Almost uniquely in the US economy, internet giants have had essentially no regulatory burdens,\" said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and now frequent critic of it and others like it. \"That's not normal for businesses that have as much impact as these have.\" Brianna Wu, a game developer now running for Congress in Massachusetts, said if elected she would propose an \"omnibus bill of rights\" governing how tech companies will have to handle our data. Like GDPR, this would affect every company gathering our data, from Big Tech to the many companies that recently had breaches, including Equifax and Saks and Lord &amp; Taylor.</p><p>Google has an advertising model that is just as data-hungry as Facebook's. It doesn't just gather our search history and location; its YouTube platform tracks our taste in media. Since 2012, the company has pooled data on us across all its properties.</p><p>Arguably, Google has more experience than Facebook with regulators: in 2013, Google settled with the Federal Trade Commission over competition issues, and for months it has been promoting its efforts to comply with GDPR. Yet unlike Facebook, Google isn't planning to roll out GDPR-type privacy protections everywhere it operates, so it could be less prepared should similar rules come to the US.</p><p>Amazon already runs a $US2.8bn-a-year advertising business that targets ads using harvested data. But Amazon doesn't have to buy our purchase history from data brokers - information even Facebook says it will eliminate from its advertising system. Since Amazon's retail-and-advertising ecosystem is mostly self-contained, it won't have to change as many practices as its competitors will. Still, the full burden of GDPR won't become clear until customers and their lawyers begin to test its sometimes-vague protections.</p><p>\"Amazon has a longstanding commitment to privacy and data security, and we are committed to complying with GDPR requirements when they come into effect,\" an Amazon spokesman said.</p><p>GDPR is likely to strengthen Apple's position in the short term. \"Apple will find GDPR to be very much consistent with its value system,\" Mr McNamee said. Apple advocates differential privacy, an approach to data collection that is meant to prevent our data from being personally identifiable. It has already rolled out changes to the iOS mobile operating system in anticipation of the regulations.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to say his company would never make the kind of mistakes that Facebook has. But Mr Cook's confidence belies the fact that Facebook - now overwhelmingly accessed via mobile devices - would scarcely exist without the iPhone and its Android-powered imitators.Facebook may be making most of the headlines right now, but in the long run Apple, Google and Amazon also are likely to face emboldened regulators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-35ce2ef23ba611e889c0b5946d8509d1560a73edbcd72898cfd06b2a4f0497a7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2J-H7K1-JD3N-504S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 10, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Psychology experts and tech executives claim the analogy is misguided. Digital technology, including social media, is now necessary for people to complete their jobs. Solutions must be based on personal empowerment, not top-down bans, they claim. </p><p>At the World Economic Forum recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff drew a contentious analogy[1] linking social media consumption to cigarette smoking. Interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin had asked Benioff how to regulate a company like Facebook, which has been fighting claims that the platform keeps people hooked[2] and disseminates fake news[3]. Benioff replied, \"You'd do it exactly the same way you regulated the cigarette industry,\" since both products lead to addictive behavior and each is potentially harmful. \"Maybe there [are] all kinds of different forces trying to get you to do certain things,\" Benioff said. \"There's a lot of parallels.\"Digital technology is a modern necessityAccording to psychology experts and tech executives working to curb tech addiction, Benioff's analogy falls short. Treating Facebook and other platforms like tobacco companies overlooks how vital smartphones and other digital technology are to everyday life, which complicates the way they can be regulated, these experts say.Recent Pew surveys indicate[4] that people use their online social networks to get information that helps them solve problems at work, connect with the right people, and ask work-related questions of people outside their organization. While some people use Facebook to waste time, which we might think of as a digital smoke-break, the social network and its many peers \u2014 such as LinkedIn and Twitter \u2014 also enrich people's professional lives. Gabe Zichermann, CEO of Onward, an app that helps people manage their tech use, wrote recently[5] that social media is no longer just a time-waster at work.  \"If their work involves engineering, marketing, sales, recruitment, or communications they need to be on social media during the day,\" argued Gabe Zichermann, CEO of Onward, an app that helps people manage their tech use, in a recent article. \"And they would reject paternalistic efforts to reduce tech use.\" Social-media use looks more like over-eatingSherry Turkle, an MIT psychologist and author of \"Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other,\"[6]argues there's a closer analogy that should help solve the problem of tech overuse. \"I think it's much less like smoking and much more like eating,\" Turkle told Business Insider. \"We have to eat, and people need to learn to make good food choices.\" A crisis of tech addiction, in other words, looks more like the ongoing obesity epidemic[7]. While rates of cigarette smoking have been on the decline[8] in the US for several decades, obesity rates continue to grow. And just as major food corporations sell processed foods that are loaded with added sugar and chemicals meant to keep people eating, Turkle and other addiction experts say big tech companies have been repeatedly accused of designing their apps to maximize the time people spend on them. Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, has seenthe engineering tricks[9]firsthand. Features like autoplay videos, endless scrolling, and gamification encourage constant use, Harris has said. They help explain how people may plan to watch just one YouTube video and glance at Twitter but somehow end up spending a half hour on both. Turkle encourages people to seriously evaluate how much time they spend on devices, since it's not feasible to eliminate tech altogether. She believes it may also be necessary for governments to impose mandates in tech design that prevent kids from using tech without parental supervision. \"The way I like to put it is technology can make us forget what we know about life,\" she said. \"One of the things it's made us forget is that we need to tend to our relationships and other people and our own feelings.\"NOW WATCH: These robots

Benioff replied, \"<br/> You'd do it exactly the same way you regulated the cigarette industry,\" since both products lead to addictive behavior and each is potentially harmful.</p><p><br/> \"Maybe there [are] all kinds of different forces trying to get you to do certain things,\" Benioff said. \"There's a lot of parallels.\" Digital technology is a modern necessity<br/> According to psychology experts and tech executives working to curb tech addiction, Benioff's analogy falls short. Treating Facebook and other platforms like tobacco companies overlooks how vital smartphones and other digital technology are to everyday life, which complicates the way they can be regulated, these experts say.<br/> Recent Pew surveys indicate that people use their online social networks to get information that helps them solve problems at work, connect with the right people, and ask work-related questions of people outside their organization.<br/> While some people use Facebook to waste time, which we might think of as a digital smoke-break, the social network and its many peers - such as LinkedIn and Twitter - also enrich people's professional lives.<br/> Gabe Zichermann, CEO of Onward, an app that helps people manage their tech use, wrote recently that social media is no longer just a time-waster at work. \"If their work involves engineering, marketing, sales, recruitment, or communications theyneedto be on social media during the day,\" argued Gabe Zichermann, CEO of Onward, an app that helps people manage their tech use, in a recent article. \"And they would reject paternalistic efforts to reduce tech use.\"<br/> Social-media use looks more like over-eating<br/> Sherry Turkle, an MIT psychologist and author of \"Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other,\" argues there's a closer analogy that should help solve the problem of tech overuse.<br/> \"I think it's much less like smoking and much more like eating,\" Turkle told Business Insider. \"We have to eat, and people need to learn to make good food choices.\"<br/> A crisis of tech addiction, in other words, looks more like the ongoing obesity epidemic . While rates of cigarette smoking have been on the decline in the US for several decades, obesity rates continue to grow. And j<br/> ust as major food corporations sell processed foods that are loaded with added sugar and chemicals meant to keep people eating, Turkle and other addiction experts say big tech companies have been repeatedly accused of designing their apps to maximize the time people spend on them.<br/> Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, has seen the engineering tricks firsthand. Features like autoplay videos, endless scrolling, and gamification encourage constant use, Harris has said. They help explain how people may plan to watch just one YouTube video and glance at Twitter but somehow end up spending a half hour on both.<br/> Turkle encourages people to seriously evaluate how much time they spend on devices, since it's not feasible to eliminate tech altogether. She believes it may also be necessary for governments to impose mandates in tech design that prevent kids from using tech without parental supervision.<br/> \"The way I like to put it is technology can make us forget what we know about life,\" she said. \"One of the things it's made us forget is that we need to tend to our relationships and other people and our own feelings.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10371743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RK9-STM1-DYDW-71DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most people believed Benioff's obsession with LinkedIn was rooted in the vast amounts of data the professional network owns in its database. That importance became particularly clear\u00a0after Salesforce complained to regulators about the Microsoft/LinkedIn deal,[1] citing ownership of LinkedIn's data as the reason for the complaint. </p><p>Meanwhile, Salesforce launched a new artificial intelligence product called Einstein last month, which requires lots of data to push out predictive analytics. But speaking at a\u00a0meeting with financial analysts on Wednesday\u00a0at his company's big tech conference, Benioff insisted\u00a0the real reason he was willing to pay so much for\u00a0LinkedIn wasn't about the data. It was all about LinkedIn's financials, especially the growth in deferred revenue, he says. \"I really like the financial characteristics of the company, and that's why I was willing to go to a higher price just because I felt like the asset was undervalued,\" Benioff\u00a0told them. \"I was valuing that asset based on their deferred revenue. That's it. I wasn't valuing that asset based on the data,\" he added, referring to LinkedIn.Deferred revenueDeferred revenue is the amount of money that has not been recorded as revenue \u2014 yet. In the subscription software business, in which both Salesforce and LinkedIn are in, revenue gets recognized only when the actual service is delivered.  That means if you sign a $1,200-a-year contract, only a quarter of the amount (or $300) gets recorded as revenue in the first quarter, with the remaining $900 going to deferred revenue. Each passing quarter, another $300 would get added to revenue, while the same amount would get reduced from deferred revenue. LinkedIn\u00a0has indeed grown its deferred revenue significantly over the past few years. As of the end of 2015, it had $709 million of deferred revenue, up 35% from the previous year. Its deferred revenue jumped 33% and 52% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Benioff argues some Wall Street people still don't understand this part of the deferred revenue model and that it's probably why LinkedIn was so undervalued. In February, LinkedIn lost nearly half of its market cap after giving weak earnings guidance. Growth in deferred revenue could be seen as\u00a0the company adding lots of new contracts that are pretty much guaranteed to convert to actual revenue, and perhaps selling more to existing customers as well, reflecting product stickiness. Not interested in TwitterIt's hard to tell if Benioff's interest in LinkedIn was really just based on deferred revenue. The number is not a new metric or anything, and most Wall Street analysts fully understand how cloud subscription businesses work these days anyway. Instead, Benioff may have made those comments to convince the investor community that he's not interested in Twitter. In fact,\u00a0Benioff\u00a0also says\u00a0that\u00a0Salesforce isn't hugely dependent on data from elsewhere to make Einstein a really strong predictive engine. \"We have massive amounts of customer data...I would say we have the data that we already need,\" Benioff said during the analyst meeting. Evercore's analyst Kirk Materne pointed out\u00a0in a note Thursday, Benioff's comments illustrate that\u00a0Twitter fails to fit Salesforce's\u00a0acquisition profile because it doesn't have a large deferred revenue balance (not a recurring revenue model) and can only offer huge amounts of data. \"While Benioff did not explicitly refute the idea that Salesforce\u00a0could bid on\u00a0Twitter, we believe a number of the points that he made would seem to indicate that the chances of deal happening are fairly low,\" Materne wrote. Investors clearly seem to welcome Benioff's comments. Salesforce stock dropped as much as 8% earlier this week after it was reported to be interested in buying Twitter, but went back\u00a0up more than 4% Thursday.NOW WATCH: NASA just took these

Now the next step is we want to see him actually make them,\" Benioff told us. \"We're not going to stop until the new law is done.\"&lt;nl/&gt; He also told us that the campaign to fix the Indiana law has already caused at least one other state, Georgia, to put the brakes on a similar law. (Salesforce also has offices in Atlanta.)&lt;nl/&gt; To recap: Salesforce is the largest tech employer in Indiana. It has, for weeks, lobbied the state not to pass the law for fear that it would allow business owners, citing their religious beliefs, to discriminate against its employees or customers who are members of the LGBT community.&lt;nl/&gt; Pence argued that the law, known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, does not allow discrimination. But after the bill was signed, some lawmakers admitted [3]that businesses would be allowed to post 'No Gays allowed' signs in areas within Indiana.&lt;nl/&gt; After the law was signed, Benioff announced that he would reduce investment in the state and immediately canceled all events held there, as well as halting all employee travel to the state. One big Salesforce event can bring in $8 to $9 million of revenue to the city, MSNBC reported.[4]&lt;nl/&gt; Business Insider: Right now, you cancelled all events and said you are not going to make further investment in Indiana. Now it looks like Indiana will reverse its position. When are you going to reinstate events?&lt;nl/&gt; <person><nameText>Marc Benioff</nameText></person>: As soon as the new law is in place. We're not going to stop until the new law is done. We've seen them make a lot of progress. I thought today's press conference was very optimistic. But until the new law is in place, we're going to continue our campaign.&lt;nl/&gt; Today we moved from Phase 1 to Phase 2. We see the governor saying he's going to make changes. Now the next step is we want to see him actually make them.&lt;nl/&gt; BI: From the research I've done, I've seen a lot of notes of condemnation. People saying 'maybe we'll move our events if we hear things are really bad.[5]' But I haven't seen too many companies take as strong as action as Salesforce. What other actions are you aware of?&lt;nl/&gt; MB: People have definitely taken specific actions including Angie's List, putting their project on hold. I've heard of other companies saying they are redacting their investment until there's clarity of the law. [Note: Angie's List indefinitely halted the $40 million expansion of its headquarters[6].]&lt;nl/&gt; BI: People are now looking at Arkansas and other states working on similar laws. If you are successful in Indiana, do you think that will be influential in some of these other states?&lt;nl/&gt; MB: It is being influential already. We saw in Georgia that the Georgia law did not proceed because they thought the same thing was going to happen to them. Georgia has a big tech component and we have big office in Atlanta.&lt;nl/&gt; In a rural state like in Arkansas it will be a different ball game for sure. We don't have employees in Arkansas.&lt;nl/&gt; [Note: Georgia cancelled a meeting to discuss a similar law[7]. Arkansas on Tuesday passed a similar bill [8]and the governor is expected to sign it.]&lt;nl/&gt;NOW WATCH: A lawyer in Florida has come up with an ingenious way for drivers to evade drunken-driving

My name is Murat S\u00c3\u00b6nmez, I'm a member of the Managing Board of the World Economic Forum and head of the new center we established in San Francisco on the 4th Industrial Revolution. It's a privilege and pleasure to welcome all of you to our session on achieving inclusive growth in the 4th Industrial Revolution, which is not only the theme of this session, but the whole meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we know, the 4th Industrial Revolution is impacting every aspects of life, from business to society to government and even to who we are and our own identity. But as we move forward in the 4th Industrial Revolution, we cannot leave people behind, and achieving inclusive growth is essential just to make sure that everybody participates in the benefits of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and also, we minimize the downside of it. And our distinguished panel with us will discuss that today.</p><p>This is the reason why the World Economic Forum decided to open a center dedicated to this topic in San Francisco, taking a look at specific technologies with a human-centric approach and identifying the positive impact to the citizens and to the society and working backwards to develop the governance protocols and the policy frameworks to make sure that we accelerate the positive impact and minimize the negative impact.</p><p>It is an applied research center where we sit down with industry leaders, government leaders, start-ups, international organizations, top research universities and co-design these protocols and implement them through pilot implementations.</p><p>We all welcome -- we all invite you, all of you, to join us at the center and reach out to your counterpart at the World Economic Forum, if you're interested. With that, I'll hand over the session to my colleague, Nick Davis, to kick it off. Nick, the floor is yours.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Murat, and thank you, everyone, for being here. This session is titled the same as the theme of this conference, achieving inclusive growth in the 4th Industrial Revolution. And I want to start by reminding us all that science and technology are not ends in themselves, neither really is economic progress.</p><p>The point of us being here as part of the World Economic Forum network and community, the point of the activities that we do when we're not lucky enough to sit here and talk about technology is really to improve our own and others' lives in different ways. And possibly, the greatest challenge of any industrial revolution is making sure that those who are normally vulnerable or excluded are able to participate in it. And so the topic of discussion and the channel -- challenge for this panel is to ask ourselves the question what do we need to do to make the coming, the ongoing revolution in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, 3D printing, neurotech, space exploration and new frontiers in almost every part of science, how do we make sure that those are truly inclusive and able to benefit the largest number of people.</p><p>And it's a fantastic opportunity to sit here and discuss this in China, not just because China is a world leader in science and technology, but you may know that China and the economic progress, the improvement in living standards here, in this country, over the last 30 years was responsible for more than half, well more than half of the global increase in living standards and reduction in numbers of people in poverty. And so it's here that we have 4 fantastic, distinguished panelists to give us a vision, but not just a vision, some practical ideas about what all of us can do to help achieve that sense of inclusion, those real benefits to people around the world as a result of the exciting technology that many of you are working on and developing. And to do this, we have Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, from Singapore, who's also the coordinating minister for social and economic affairs. We have Jean Liu, who is the President of Didi Chuxing, a very well-known and exciting ridesharing company and more here in China. We have a member of the forum's Board of Trustees, but also Chairman, CEO and founder of Salesforce, <person><nameText>Marc Benioff, </nameText></person>and a close friend of the forum as well. And finally, the distinguished economist, Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics from George Mason University. And I hope that this will be an opportunity for the panelists to have a little bit of a debate and a challenge to each other and to you as well before we finish in about 48 minutes time.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: I'm going to open by turning to first speaker on my left here, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, maybe to set the stage for us a little bit. What is the current context for inclusive growth? Where do we stand today, and what worries and excites you?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, thanks a lot. I think the broad description of the problem is first one of middle class stagnation across a broad range of the more advanced economies. And second, it has to be emphasized because it's not [substantially] noticed is the fact that we haven't had much catch up from most of the developing world with the advanced world. The conventional theories of economic development just haven't played out with the exception of 4 smaller Asian economies in the '70s and '80s and now coastal China. But those are exceptions. If you look at Africa, if you look at the broad swath of South Asia, if you look at Latin America, there's been very little movement relative to the [frontier]. Let's say if you look at American levels of productivity and incomes and if you look at what's happened since the '60s till now, there's been very little movement, very little convergence from less developed in the direction of -- or in catching up with the most developed. Globalization, national economies just haven't played out in the way they should. The source of the problem we know for the first issue, a middle class stagnation, is weak productivity growth, and this is something which economists on the left and right would agree on, that if you don't have a sustained uplift of productivity growth, we're not going to get an uplift of median incomes or incomes of the broad middle. That, I think, we agree on.</p><p>The source of that problem is that we actually don't have that much disruption happening in our economies. Despite all that's said about Google and Facebook and the latest developments in AI, the spread of new technologies isn't that wide. The Internet may appear to be everywhere, but it's not really used that intensively. And most new technologies escape the large, small and medium enterprise sector of most economies, and they escape whole sectors apart from a few leaders in each sector, so that the fusion of new technologies has not been rapid and large parts of the advanced economies, in fact, most economies, don't have enough disruption. So we need more disruption.</p><p>Second problem, the lack of catch-up and lack of convergence, I would say, also reflects a lack of globalization. In fact, most of Africa, most of South Asia, most of Latin America is not inserted in the global economy, they are inserted within semi-protected economies or they're just not part of the market economy. So we need more disruption, more technological innovation and more globalization, a little contrary to what some of the magazine articles will tell us. But it's only going to work if we have more activist social strategies as well, which is a domestic policy imperative. Because without active social compacts formed through federal and local government initiative and public-private initiatives, it's very difficult for us to sustain an era of greater disruption, because jobs and firms will be disrupted, and to sustain globalization and bring it up to a new level, including a much larger part of the world. And I think that the interesting story coming out of the last few years, when you think of activist social policies, it's not just traditional redistribution, about 1% against 99% or 10% against 90% and how you go about redistributing, it's about the failure to regenerate towns and the failure to integrate neighborhoods in a whole range of countries. If you look at the Brexit vote, if you look at the U.S. presidential elections last year, if you look at even voting patterns in Instanbul, Paris, Moscow, a whole range of places, voting patterns are very different in the most -- the largest most cosmopolitan cities compared to the suburbs, the smaller towns and the countryside, starkly different in Brexit, starkly different in the U.S. presidential elections, and that's telling us something. We have to think about the local. We have to think about how we help local communities regenerate themselves, and the traditional methods of redistribution just don't do it. It has to be about specialization, has to be about capabilities. It has to be about communities of learning and communities of mutual help.</p><p>And that works at the local level, very rarely works continental scale economy or national level. But it works at the local level because people know each other, you know who the employers are, the employers know who's in the community college or the universities or high schools. You can actually form a community, a community of learning, a community of mutual help. And far more attention in social policy, federal and local, across a whole range of countries has to be paid to these local factors, regenerating communities because disruption will have to be part of life. If it's not part of life, we're going to get stuck at low productivity growth, and we're going to get stuck at incomes that just don't change from one generation to another or start slipping, which is what's happened.</p><p>Finally, just one quick point because the biggest issue is really about the emerging world, the developing world and the lack of catch-up. And we have to think very hard there of how we use technology to make access to the modern world and to make access to global markets much easier and much cheaper for small enterprise and for individuals. And the good thing is that it can be done. Broadband can be put in place. High-speed broadband. Regulatory systems can be changed so as to protect incumbents less and encourage new players to come in because competition is quite essential in the IT space and in the technology space, generally, it's what promotes innovation. In fact, there's a long way to go in regulatory reform in a whole range of developing countries to be able to bring in new technologies faster. And the real beneficiary -- we know who the losers are amongst incumbents, but the real beneficiary is a much broader swath of small players and individuals. And we have to make this move because the consequences are dire if we don't achieve this. It's not just about some countries being left behind, it's going to be consequences of a geopolitical nature.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Tharman. So taking us from the big picture context of the challenges facing us, down to some of the innovations in policy as well as the old tasks that we know that we still have yet to complete in economic policy as well on that. So Jean, you are one of the disruptors that Tharman talked about there. And here in China, you have a grand vision for the sharing economy and mobility. Talk us through how your version of this fits into inclusivity and inclusive growth.</p><p>JEAN LIU: Thank you. I totally agree with Deputy Prime Minister on disruption. I think we do need more disruption on technology and on business model. But at the end of the day, we need to figure out why do we need those. We need those to benefit humanity, to serve every individual in this room. So in our daily work, what we are trying to do, which is to maximize the benefit of technology and sharing economy to serve 2 purposes. So the first one is on the resource problem. That is a problem that's facing all human being right now on this planet. For example, if all Beijing, Shanghai people want to copy the lifestyle of Los Angeles, then we will have a resource crisis again. So the sharing economy and the data science we are utilizing today is basically to improve the utilization rate of all the cars, of the road space, of all the energies. So that's the #1 point. And I think without this new business model, we cannot imagine what will happen on resource. And second, more importantly, is from an economy perspective, what it's doing to all of us. Everyone knows China is going through this restructuring economy. And actually, on our platform, most of the drivers are part-time drivers. They earn the second income for their family, so they are young graduates who haven't figured out what they want to do for their lifetime. They are stay-at-home moms. They're coal miners who will lose their jobs very soon, right? And in our platform, we provide them dignity for life. For example, about 2 million drivers on our platform earn at least $30 a day. And if you do the math, monthly rate is 3x of China's minimum wage. So we help these people to transition for their next stop in their life. We're not saying they will do this job forever, but this is to prepare them for the next challenge. And from a bigger-scale perspective, this is to prepare our economy for the next challenge. So it's not just serving as the landing cushion, it's also a launching pad for our economy. So that's what we are talking about these days.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: And just as a follow-up to this, you're also been involved in other parts of the sharing economy, and I know that Ofo and Mobike consumer-led schemes have started to take this using the Internet of Things approach to sharing bicycles. How fast is the sharing economy growing in China? What's the potential here that you see to transform cities and to perform other tasks?</p><p>JEAN LIU: It's huge. And after 5 years -- we're a young company, very young company. But after 5 years, we provide 20 million rides on a daily basis, which is 2x of the other markets adding up together. And it's not just -- and also, it's not just to provide private car share, it's also taxi, minibus, buses and bikes on our platform. So that's the other beauty of sharing economy. I think it also provide inclusive growth here, so everyone can have a fair access to mobility service. It's not just for higher-income people, for lower-income people can also have easier access to service they would like to enjoy.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you. Turning to Marc. We've talked a little bit about the macro contextual problems. We've talked about a set of technologies here building on digital and the sharing economy, touching on IoT. But the 4th Industrial Revolution is being driven by lots of exciting and some unknown and uncertain technologies. When you look from where you are in San Francisco, out into the world of emerging technology, where do you see some areas that we need to be excited and dynamic about and where are some areas that we maybe need to be worried about inclusion and thoughtful before they come out?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF, </nameText></person>CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SALESFORCE.COM, INC.: Good. Okay, well, thanks, Nick. First of all, let me reinforce what Murat said, which is that the World Economic Forum is building a very exciting new center in San Francisco, in the Presidio, which is called the Center for the 4th Industrial Revolution. It's based on many of the concepts that Nick wrote about in the books that you've seen published by the World Economic Forum with Klaus Schwab and these incredible world-changing concepts with regard to technology and shifts that are going on. And there are so many exciting new technologies that are emerging, both in the biological sciences, as you know, and also information technology. The biggest shift on the technology side that we can see happening today is certainly artificial intelligence, and artificial intelligence is growing now at a just much faster rate than ever expected. And it's not just machine intelligence, it's not just machine learning, it's also deep learning, and other really incredible new characteristics of artificial intelligence, including vision and object detection and others, but this idea that there's this broad new platform, which is what AI is, it's an incredible new platform that I think that if any of us were to start our companies over again, we would start with the AI as the platform and build up. Today, many of us are including now and building AI within our existing platforms. That's probably true of almost every company that I'm thinking of today that's in the mainstream. And the artificial intelligence is going to have dramatic effects and dramatic changes on our society and dramatically improve not just our health care, not just our levels of productivity, but it's also going to be very disruptive. And I think a lot of us realize that it will also create an incredible crisis of equality. And this crisis of equality is going to really shake our society in many different areas. And the crisis of equality that artificial intelligence will bring will, I think, really make us look at some of the foundational aspects of society. Of course, we're going to probably look at things like basic income, but we're probably also going to look at things like how do we build new models of education and learning, especially as we start to displace more and more workers. We heard Premier Li today speak about how as larger companies bring in these next generations of automation that workers, in many cases, indeed are displaced, and that's why there's more reliance today on new business creation and next-generation small and medium businesses. Well, I couldn't agree with him even more than that. He's absolutely right. But what I can also tell you is that this crisis of equality is going to also affect how we manage our companies and lead them. And I think we saw that playing out today -- this week, in the newspapers and the magazines around the world. And we saw that Uber went through a significant change in their management structure, the CEO was fired and one of the board members left and so forth. What happened? Well, it wasn't that long ago, it's only in February that there was really an incredible article, incredible article written by one of their executives, Susan Fowler, who really just pointed out that they had created a culture that was not about equality. And it triggered inside a true 4th Industrial Revolution company, Uber, a crisis of equality. And you could see it start to play out to the point where women felt unsafe to work at Uber, and that is a terrible situation for any company, and it's certainly a terrible situation for women when they feel that way that they don't feel safe in an organization. And this, I believe, is going to be reflected in society going forward. When we talk about inclusive growth, which is the title of this. What that means to me is equality. It means that we are including everybody. That is we are including all genders, all races, all sexual orientations, everyone. We include everyone. We treat them equally. We give them equal opportunity. We pay them equally. The World Economic Forum writes an incredible, incredible report. And if you haven't read some of the work that Satya has done, I mean, the gender pay report, okay, says that it's going to still take us 170 years before we have gender pay equality. This should be a sign that we have throughout our organizations these very serious problems that need to be addressed today. So we must search for greater levels of equality within ourselves and that this will be absolutely a critical and intrinsic part of this 4th Industrial Revolution. And if you think that any company or any country or any nongovernmental organization will escape that crisis of equality, I assure you that none will. And that's kind of where I see it as of right now.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Marc. And I want to come back to Jean in a minute to ask about how Didi is dealing with those same inclusion aspects in a fast-growing company here in China. But before I do, I'd like to turn to Tyler Cowen. Tyler, Tharman opened by saying he was concerned about a lack of disruption, a lack of dynamism in the global economy, and you've written about the great stagnation, about the complacent classes. And in fact, in some of that work pointed to the fact that technologies have had a role in perhaps distracting us or making us less dynamic, less attentive to some of the bigger problems around us. When we think about this challenge of inclusive growth and the need to be more dynamic, what's your take on what countries, what people, what organizations need to do? And how does it look from the economics perspective from where you stand, looking at the data and not just at discussions and corporate culture?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: If we look at most of the Western world, for at least 15 years, real wages for the middle class have been stagnant or, in a few cases, even falling. This is the most important fact of our times. So if you are reading that we are receiving a new technological cornucopia of incredible products, basically, that cannot be true. It would be showing up in the real wages of most people. I think in the United States, in particular, we have an economy with several quite stagnant sectors. Health care, almost 18% of our GDP. It's incredible, the highest in the world, yet, over the last 10 years, our mortality numbers have disappointed. They have come in below par. In many counties of my country, people are now dying sooner than they had 10 or 15 years ago. If you look at education, just ask a simple question, to date, how much has the Internet improved education in the United States? The answer is not quite 0, but the biggest thing that goes on/off and it's simply e-mailing your professor, there are now some MOOCs, we're not sure how well that will do. Most of education is unchanged, it's fairly stagnant. Simple core question for real people. What does it cost to buy a house in an above average school district. Every year, this costs more. And that cost going up is actually far more significant than most of the benefits that tech has brought us. Just a simple number that's really striking. We've talked about Uber. Let me say in passing, I'm much more optimistic about Didi than Uber. But you look at Uber in the United States, Uber hired Steve Levitt, one of the most famous economists in the world, to do a study what is the social benefit of Uber for each American, on average? This is a study done by Uber. The answer was $20, which is fine, great, $20 per person. How many of us in this room have produced $20 of value for each American? But at the end of the day, that's just like a fluctuation in your electricity bill or a fraction of your property tax increase. It's not that big a deal. So the Internet has made leisure much better. It's connected us to people much more. But it's very instructive to compare, say, the last 10 years of the Internet to 1995, 1998, which I would say was the true information technology revolution. In those years, IT was very powerful and you see output going up at a rate of higher than 3% in most sectors of the American economy. Right now, we're doing more with information, but so much of our economy resists improvement. Or look at government, we don't even know how to measure the quality of government. What does that tell you, right? Is government working hard to get us a means to do so? I would say not. In my country and many other countries, in my opinion, the quality of government probably is declining. So when you have such major sectors as health care, education and government either semi-stagnant or declining and disappointing, you can be doing a lot of things right, you can have heroic entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, which I'm a big fan of by the way. I love the big tech companies, I'm not anti-tech. But GDP is a huge mountain, and to make a dent in that mountain and have a growth rate of 3%, it's much, much harder than people realize. And right now, we are not there. We need more disruption. We need more entrepreneurship. And as we heard from Singapore, we need it for the whole world. Service sector productivity is stagnant even in Singapore. Even in Singapore, they cannot really get it to increase, and that tells you something. It is a hard problem.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you, Tyler. So this is the problem we're faced with. And back to you, Jean, because you're at the heart of this in trying to move a mountain in many ways. What's your response to Tyler on this?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. I think the key topic we're talking about is being inclusive here, and it's actually our company's philosophy. And I also want to address the point Professor Cowen just made. A lot of people think, for our industry, ridesharing, we compete with taxis fiercely, for example. But actually, it's not. We consider -- our philosophy is we should be inclusive of each other. And both taxis and ridesharing should be an alternative to private car sharing. That's a solution to the private car. If you think about China, which is the country I'm most familiar with, we have 150 million private car owners, I would say. Actually, we have 200 million cars and -- private cars. And if you assume every driver drives 1.5 times a day, that's maximum already, that's 300 million drivers. And in our vision, transportation in the long run will become, as a matter of fact, a service rather than a form of ownership, right. When transportation becomes a service, we can free, liberate, all these car owners then we can engage more taxi drivers and rideshare drivers, together, to work for people like all of us here. So that's being inclusive here, that's the benefit of being inclusive here. And also, we'll do a very good impact utilizing technology and based on sharing economy, and we will serve all of humanity. And the second part, on the diversity. I'm very glad that Marc talked about it. I think we also -- we're a company that truly believe in diversity. First of all, we are trying to go global. A lot of people are talking about Uber. We also see global market is the future market. Our philosophy is we have to create customer value. We have -- it's not we want to go global and we have to, it's if we can bring value to people there. And to bring value, we have to study very deeply what local customers need. So we have to respect local diversity. And from a company's culture perspective, we also need to understand each employee. What's their insights, what's their inner growth drivers? So for example, we have this women network, which I personally feel extremely passionate about. Didi has more than -- has 50% women employees and about 40% of senior women executives. So for example, we talk about how women can develop career in our company, and we encourage all the moms and pregnant women to take one day off -- to work from home, actually, every week. So that's from a company's perspective and also from a economic perspective, how we look at inclusive and diversity.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Perfect. So we're kind of orbiting around 2 of these important topics here. And I want to bring Tharman back in to maybe bring us down one more level. And picking up on Tyler's point about this really need to do something, this urgent need to do something. And yes, in Singapore, so you -- I'm sure you have many experiences about how reforming education, reforming government to develop more dynamism, but also transmitting that across the world in different ways is part of what you mentioned in the globalization of some of these ideas. You mentioned a few ideas before, but what are some practical examples that we can hook on to and maybe take back with us to our home cities or elsewhere to learn from and build on together?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, it's a couple of things. And I say this not because Singapore is a model for the world in any sense, but it has worked in Singapore reasonably well and there may be some interesting parallels with other cities. First, I think we have to reshape education and reverse the trend of over-academization that's taken place in the last 40 to 50 years almost everywhere, including in China, and India. The overemphasis on the academic track, not just in schools, but in tertiary education, such that the 4-year regular college education model has become dominant. It just doesn't meet the needs of the real world and it doesn't meet the needs of the natural spectrum of abilities that we have in any society. We have to take a step back and ask, how do we develop the talents, skills and enthusiasm of individuals in a way that's relevant to the real world, relevant to opportunities that face them in the market or opportunities that they can create in the market? And it requires a much more flexible blend of the academic and the practical, and it requires reinvestment at different points of your life. Far too much is front-loaded now into the first 18 to 22 years of life. And I think we all agree that, that investment was useful in a general sense, depreciates quite quickly and you've got to keep learning through life. But we don't have the infrastructure for learning through life. We don't have the financing schemes. And individuals are more or less on their own. Quite different from school where you've got a teacher and a headmaster or principal. In fact, far too much management and shepherding that takes place in the early years. And then you're left on your own, you're left on your own once you're in adult life. We need more curation, more mentoring, more advice, and a lot of it can be done at the local community level. And we have to develop that system, intermediaries, including intermediaries who are doing it for commercial reasons who can help individuals shape their future learning. We need financing to be spread out from this -- take the overconcentration in the early years and spread it out more through life, so at regular intervals in life, people can learn. We're trying to do it in Singapore through what we call SkillsFuture. It's our most important social and economic initiative. It's not just economic, it's social. It's ultimately a more egalitarian way of developing people through life compared to the traditional forms of meritocracy which take place largely in school systems.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Marc, you've worked a lot in the San Francisco and Bay Area, with schools and on the topic of education with Salesforce. What have you learned here about the opportunity for inclusion, particularly in the area of emerging technologies around new forms of education?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Well, I couldn't agree more with what my good friend from Singapore is talking about, and I hadn't heard the words over-academization. Is that what it is?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: I think I just said that.</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: How do you say it -- how do you pronounce it?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: No, I won't try it again.</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Okay, I can't pronounce it. But anyway, I love that. And I completely agree with that. And I think it's absolutely connected as well to the gentleman on my left who really talked about the crisis of growth. So and I talked about the crisis of equality, and I'll try to start to weave these together and how they're related. So I think that when you start to look at what's going on, especially as these new technologies are coming in. And as I said, AI is kind of the mother of all technologies, if you will. And then, I've also said that the speed of that is coming in is unprecedented. So you're going to get this kind of high levels of job displacement, okay? And you're going to get increasing levels of productivity and efficiency. There's just no doubt about it. And that's going to further compound I think, some of the points that you made very well. And what you're going to have to get to is really what you talked about, which I think was great, which is when you talk about SkillsFuture, easier to pronounce, I -- one of the first things I did was I -- certainly, I want to be able to impact our new administration in the United States as much as I could, and I went to Washington, D.C. and I challenged President Trump. And I said, \"Look, my #1 thing that I would like you to do is to focus on 5 million apprenticeships in the United States by 2020. And that really make apprenticeships a national goal. Now, of course, I thought that he would completely resonate with the word apprentice, so I knew I had a running start on that, okay. So -- and in fact, he did. He said, \"Okay, I take your challenge. We're going to -- we'll go for this 5 million.\" And why I'm excited about that is because I think that as we get increasing levels of automation that we have got to be ready to rapidly retrain people and give them these kinds of apprenticeships or these SkillsFuture, and traditional academic means is not going to be the answer. Now to Nick's point, they better have solid reading and writing capability that you would see like in K-12, that the foundation and the fundamentals need to be there. But if those fundamentals are there, this opportunity to create apprenticeships, whether they're coming out of that K-8 environment or out of a high school environment or whether they're mature workers and they need to be retrained because their jobs have been replaced, we have got to be ready to have nationalized apprenticeship programs that are deeply integrated with the structures of our economy. And companies like mine, this is something that we are really focused on. Of course, Salesforce is the world's fastest-growing enterprise software company. We'll do over $10 billion in revenue this year. We have over 26,000 employees. We're the #1 customer relationship management provider in the world. Everyone who's attended this conference has used Salesforce because the World Economic Forum runs on Salesforce and all of these systems that you've been using at the core of them is the Salesforce system. Now because we've built a platform, what that allows us to do is to create jobs because we are training people on how to administer and build and create and develop on that platform. Much in the same way that Didi is doing it with their cars and their systems, we're doing that as well. And we predict, through with a partnership with IDC, that we'll add 2 million jobs to the global economy and $400 billion in GDP by 2020 through our platform. So this idea that we need next-generation platforms for growth, I think, that this is something that, in my personal life, I can see is true. And I think, for Didi, it's also true. And I can probably give you dozens of examples of next-generation technology companies that are able to take these tech companies, create platforms, create opportunities not just to sell you an app for your phone, but to create something that's going to give employment and sustenance for people worldwide. And I think that, that's going to be something that we're going to see. That said, I've also said before, well I said it in Davos in January, and I'd love to hear the economist view on this, which is basic income, I think, will become a part of a society. And also, I'm sure you've thought about that as well, but that's a super controversial thing to say that there's going to be some kind of basic income needed. But as we get these very, very high levels of automation through artificial intelligence, we're going to have to ask ourselves, are we going to provide basic income through our government?</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Well, it's a great topic to bring up with 11 minutes to go in this session. But -- and I do want to get Tyler's view on that. Tyler, I was going to actually ask you to build on this education element about the fact that you are an educator in multiple respects also through your blog, Marginal Revolution and Marginal Revolution University, et cetera, and some vision there. But maybe you just give -- maybe you can give a 1-minute response, and I'll get the same from Jean and Tharman on basic income, because I think that's something where a lot of people are interested in the topic, and there's some very differing views from different sides on whether it's a good idea or not. What's your kind of 30-second to 60-second take on universal basic income?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: My country does not have the politics to support it. And since our politics seems to be getting worse, there's a lot of potential policy improvements I'm not optimistic about.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: In an ideal word, would you think it's an experiment worth taking?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: I would like to see it tried first in countries like New Zealand and Denmark and see how it goes. I think we don't know. Doing it small scale we know works, but large scale, when all the norms change, we don't know.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Jean, what do you think about this topic, particularly around automation in China?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. I would just give you an example. There's a young miner in our platform, he's a driver, and he has a rock 'n roll dream, but he works as a miner in Xiangxi province. And because his income keeps dropping every month, so he started to become our driver so that he can drive around during daytime and also play rock 'n roll. He has a band. His dream is to come to Beijing. So that's what we're trying to do here. We provide a second income to people like that, and he is actually a 5-star driver, so he's very good, he's on top of our driver list. So that's one example. We have many thousands, millions of examples like this. We are providing major or second income to a lot of people. There are 17 million drivers getting income from our platform last year. Among all of them, 4 million are retired, laid-off workers from coal miners, steelmakers or veteran. So this is what we're trying to do. And back to the -- the AI, because I think the origination of this topic is about AI and whether it will replace people's job. I think, first of all, we all understand that technology will deeply transform people's lives in many ways, and it's inevitable. But all we're here, I understand, is trying to figure out how do we face it and what's the decision we are going to make. But for our industry, the AI is intelligence driving, and it's already here, assisted parking is part of it, right? It's to make driving more safely. And back to the base income point, my view is we need to look at what's the potential market. That's why I talked about the private car ownership. We have a huge incremental market there that good human service is always needed. So that's the relationship here. So the existing part will be provided by human, good human drivers and incremental part is to make driving safer.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Right. Yes. And I think that, that's a really important point when we talk about AI and automation is that the benefits of that are not cost-saving benefits, they're lives saved. That's time that can be devoted to more productive activities. Tharman, on basic income.</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, I think in all previous waves of technological innovation, going back 200 years or even the last 50 years, the jobs that were displaced have been more than made up for by new jobs being created, typically in a different sector, but sometimes in the same sector. The question is whether this time it will be different. And to be honest, we don't know the answer to that. We don't know whether 20 or 25 years from now, intelligent machines and big data would have replaced more jobs than we are able to recreate to meet new demands. We just don't the answer to that. But what we do between now and then will also shape the answer. If we introduce something like universal basic income soon, in preparation for a day which may not come where there's not enough jobs, if we introduce it soon, we are more likely to end up in a situation where we don't have enough jobs for people. Now this may seem a little paradoxical, but the basic impulse in public policy has to be from now until -- now right through the next 1.5 decades, at least, to get as many people into jobs as possible, not to make it more comfortable for them to be out of a job, it has to be to get them into jobs. And the fact is the jobs are available. In every economy in the world, jobs are not being filled because of a lack of skills. Even in the United States, there are very large numbers of jobs that are going unfilled because of the lack of basic skills, middle skills, and, of course, the higher-end skills. So that has to be our emphasis. If we make it too easy now for people to not have to get themselves trained and we make it too easy on local politicians and entrepreneurs to not put some effort into training people up. We are more likely to end up in a situation 20, 25 years from now where, indeed, people are less employable. So I'd say concentrate on the task we have from now until the next 20 years, and we are more likely then to end up in a situation where we do not have this very dire social vision of where there's just not enough jobs for people.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Very good. In the 5 minutes we have left, and unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity to bring in the audience. But I know that this is a conversation that will continue and is continuing throughout this conference in all the other sessions. I'd like to ask each of you on the panel to bring it home to those of us who are lucky enough to be here in Dalian, keeping in mind the fact that we are incredibly privileged and yet operating on behalf of not only stakeholders in developing economies who don't have anywhere near the ability to attend a World Economic Forum conference or meeting like this, but also on behalf of future generations that will inherit the resource management and policies in societies that we are creating today. With that in mind, what do we do? What do we -- how do we energize ourselves individually in our daily lives, leaving here today going back to real life and the mass of e-mails that has stacked up over 3 days and think how can we make the technologies we work with, the organizations we work in more inclusive, create that positive social benefit, that community action that Tharman talked about. Maybe I'll start with you, Marc, because as one of the biggest proponents of the stakeholder theory that I know and a great supporter of ours, you've had many ideas. But what's your call to action for the audience here in Dalian?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Well, I kind of touched on it, which is, I mean, I can tell you what I'm doing, which is that I think that we all need to double down on our commitment to equality. I think that, just kind of touching on what Nick said, the World Economic Forum itself was built on this concept that companies need to be focused not just on their shareholders, but on their stakeholders. This idea of stakeholder theory, pioneered by Professor Klaus Schwab, the Executive Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum, is why we are all here. And stakeholder theory at its core, I think, is a theory about equality, that we, the leaders of society, have an obligation to look out for those who are less fortunate, whether they are the less educated or those who are being discriminated against or those had -- that have some type of situation that prevents them from having, and I'll come back to the topic title, inclusive growth. We need to include everybody. And I think that if we get focused on that and create the platforms to do that, we will continue to have and we'll have the best levels of success that we can.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Tyler, what's your call to action?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: I have simple advice, mostly for Americans. Stay open to China. How will we solve our digital divide? We will do it with super cheap Chinese smartphones. Who will make a lot of the future advances in biomedicine, in drones? WhatsApp is already better -- it's like an operating system. It's better than anything the United States has. We are still underestimating the innovation potential from China. For a very few voters or even intellectuals or think tanks, is openness to China a major issue? So that's my call to action. We can do it. We don't have to solve all the problems with education, though I would love to do that, too, health care and so one, but yes, simply, keeping good relations with China is actually #1 on my agenda for inclusivity, in addition to world peace.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Jean?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. Well, I'm not going to comment on that. I will start my own one. Well, as I talked about, being inclusive means inclusive of taxi drivers. Actually, we provide 3 million rides on a daily basis to taxi drivers for free. We don't charge anything, and we also provide [very sweet] functions to help them locate restaurants and even toilets at a very good location. So we work with these people a lot, and I hope everyone, when you go home and when you take the taxi ride, please be very nice and thank them for their hard work. And also if you have a private car, try to share it once a week.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Perfect. Thank you. Tharman.</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Tyler's point was directed at the United States. Let me make the point in another way, which is that what happens here, in this part of China, Dalian, the Northeast or what they call the Dongbei region, is going to tell us a lot about the solutions for the future across the world. Look at the city, highly international, both by heritage as well as the nature of its current economy. Highly innovative, they have one of the most advanced IT parks. They are innovative society, plugged in with the world, but highly innovative. But they're part of a region in North China with an enormous rustbelt, middle-aged workers facing the risk of displacement, and the numbers are not small. The difference is every -- I've been here in Dalian for -- I first came about 15 years ago, I've been here several times since. It impresses me every time I come, but the problems of the region have grown larger, like they have in the Midwest in the United States or anywhere else. But the difference is everyone I speak to in national leadership and in local leadership, not a single one of them thinks that the answer is to find some ways of curbing external competition, not a single one of them thinks that the answer is to slow down innovation and have less disruption. The answer in their minds is in social and economic policies to help those who are displaced to get back into a job or to have a decent social safety net if they are in the older age group. Journey ahead is still daunting, but they have the right policy ideas. They're free of illusions. They have some resources. And I think if there's a place in the world that will show us the way forward, it will be somewhere here.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you, Tharman. And before I more formally thank our 4 speakers in what has been an excellent panel this afternoon, I want to just say 2 quick things. The first is to echo Murat's comments, which is to say please do engage with us on this topic and come to San Francisco, join our communities and engage deeply in this discussion and further work on projects, very specifically on technology or on domains like oceans, which we work on with Marc and others out of the San Francisco center, because this is an important enough topic for the future that I think we really need to put that dynamism ourselves into it. And the second point is just an offer to you. In 2016, Professor Schwab published his book, the 4th Industrial Revolution. There is a draft follow-up copy here, which will be available at the back of the room as you leave. There's also a PDF version on top link. The reason I show it is because it's in draft format so that you can tell us what else should be in here about the way that values and principles can improve the technologies that we're building and benefits all the lives of the stakeholders that we work on behalf of around the world. And with that, thank you for being a wonderful supportive audience, and thank you to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, Jean Liu, <person><nameText>Marc Benioff </nameText></person>and my good friend, Tyler Cowen.

We're going to go ahead and get started here. I want to thank you guys all for joining us this morning. My name is Brent Bracelin. I'm the analyst here covering cloud software and analytics for KeyBanc. I guess first off, I want to thank Salesforce and the whole Salesforce team for putting together what we think will be a very differentiated event here where we expose Salesforce customers and partners and hopefully, we'll learn a lot more about Salesforce, but before we do that, I thought it might be worthwhile to at least frame the discussion around cloud as we think about the cloud evolution. Cloud is not new. We've been talking about cloud for the last 15 years and here we are with a full house of investors that still care on cloud and we think there's good reasons to care even more. So let's talk a little bit about the journey that we've been on as we think about the cloud evolution.</p><p>Two seminal moments that we look at. The birth of SaaS we're using the IPO of Salesforce back in 2004. It was a 14-year journey for Salesforce to grow from essentially their IPO to a $10 billion run rate in July. We look at the birth of IaaS, really the second big category of cloud, with the launch of AWS in 2006. And it took about 10 years for AWS to get to that $10 billion mark. So as we think about the industry, not only did AWS scale, not only did Salesforce scale, but the whole industry has scaled. And so now, we're looking at an industry that has gone from a cottage software on demand in early days to a industry that's now over $100 billion. It's a 14-year journey for this industry to get to $14 billion. But what's interesting is if you look at the opportunity, we're $100 billion in to a $1 trillion transformation. So it's still early. We've been talking about cloud for 15 years. We're going to be talking about cloud for the next 15 years. There is a big opportunity to modernize the enterprise. If I look at the $3 trillion spend in IT or in technology and telecom services, about $1.8 trillion of that annual spend is tied to what we consider the enterprise IT stack. And we think the bulk of that -- about $1 trillion of the $1.8 trillion is really up for grabs for these cloud software or cloud infrastructure players.</p><p>Maintenance is the biggest spend today at 30% of the [5]. So as we think about the market opportunity, $1.8 trillion, we're about 3% penetration. In '15, we've gone to 7% penetration; we think we'll be north of 10% penetration of the TAM by the end of this year. But that's the past. Let's talk about the future as we think about the opportunity here. What we've done is looked at the 3 large platforms: Salesforce, AWS and Azure. These are 3 leading platforms out there. Again, 14 years for Salesforce to get to $10 billion, 10 years for AWS to get to first $10 billion, Azure, 10 years to get to first $10 billion. But what we're seeing now is growth at scale. And now we're looking at Salesforce including Tableau. We think they'll get to, basically, the next $10 billion in 2 years. We saw AWS do that. They added their next $10 billion in the 2-year period, and we think Azure, over the next 2 years, will add the next $10 billion. So we're now seeing kind of growth at scale in this industry as you really see mainstream enterprise adoption of cloud.</p><p>So what we did is we took the 50 largest publicly traded SaaS companies. We took the 5 divisions of the SaaS companies, including kind of Oracle and Microsoft and Google, and came up basically with a forecast here, which is a proxy for the industry. Again, 14 years to the first $100 billion. We think in the next 2.5 years, possibly 2 years, we could add the next $100 billion, and in the next 5 years, we're going to add about $300 billion of opportunity. Looking at 2023, we think cloud penetration will be up 24% of this $1.8 trillion kind of market opportunity.</p><p>SaaS. SaaS, we have growing at about 22% CAGR. As you think about the SaaS market, there is some important things to think about that are a little different. SaaS is a seat-based driven model. So there are some natural governors to the SaaS industry, and we see SaaS growing from about a 5% market to about 13% market. In the IaaS market, it's growing faster, largely because of the business model. It's a consumption-based driven business model, and it's a little bit different. And it doesn't have the same governors to the SaaS market. Now you are starting to see some application companies move towards a consumption-based model and you are seeing some of those companies have much higher growth rates like Twilio and well -- as well as MongoDB Atlas.</p><p>So we published what's called this CloudWatch. We've been doing this for the last 3 years, which really looks at the market and investment philosophy around cloud. And what we've done is we've aggregated 50 of the largest pure plays. We look at performance, we look at market cap, we look at revenue growth trends and some interesting insights as we run this analysis for July, I want to share with you.</p><p>So the group, on average, up 50% year-to-date. So clearly, investors are paying attention to the space. And what you'll see in the last 3 years, the performance has actually been the highest in Q1 in each of the last 3 years. Q2 performance, given we had such a big run in Q1, was not as good, but you're still talking about a pretty good group year performance. But it's not just this year. This is a performance trend for the SaaS group that we track going back to 2012. For the folks that have been investing in this space, you know this is a space that has done very well and continues to attract more investors. The downside of that is we're at peek valuations. So if you look at kind of the group looking back at 4 in multiples, we are now at 12.2x the forward revenue multiple, and the average is 7.4x. We are setting new peak valuation levels for the group.</p><p>Part of that is driven by the number of new IPOs in the space. There have been 33 SaaS IPOs over the last, basically, 3 years. 50 software M&amp;A transactions for over $190 billion, so that's also influencing the valuations in the group.</p><p>What's really interesting as we draw -- dug a little deeper into the data here was what's happening in the high-growth tier of the market. So if we look at just the SaaS companies growing over 40%, a year ago, they were trading at basically a 2-turn premium to the group average. That group average is the 50%. 3 months ago, we saw that whole high-growth tier re-rate to 5x, 5x -- 5 turns higher than the average. And now we're sitting at 8 turns higher. So why is that? Why are these -- the 40% growers trading at a higher multiple than the group? And what we're seeing here is growth is accelerating at the fastest companies. I've been doing this for 20 years, and we saw a little bit of this happen in the dot-com era in the late '90s, where some of the fastest growers saw accelerating growth, but those were subscale companies. I would argue these were not subscale companies, and so there is something different. I think this feeds into this logic that we are only $100 billion into a $1 trillion transformation. So a lot of transformation, and we're seeing improving operating efficiency for this high-growth cohort.</p><p>So to some extent you could say investors are willing to, basically, underwrite a longer-duration period for these high growers. But it also does suggest there might be a little more risk there. If I take out the 40% growers, we're actually almost 2 turns below the peak. So while the overall group is at peak levels, the solid growers, 20% to 40% up at Salesforce in that camp, is nowhere near the peak. And you'll see that in, basically, our matrix here where you see some of the fastest growers. You're looking at the whole -- this notion that 20x of their 10, we're actually seeing that play out in the marketplace. But those solid growers, 20% to 30% growers, you're looking at valuation multiples, they are a little more reasonable relative to the growth, but still very good growth profiles.</p><p>So why we are here today? We are here today to talk about Salesforce, not the industry. But I think it's helpful to frame the overall market. And what I want to do is just relate -- really quickly lay out our view around Salesforce and our view around how to invest in the SaaS space particularly given the dynamics we've seen with a lot of investors looking at the space, and the space it does feel a little crowded.</p><p>So 2 things that I would have you keep in mind as you think about investing in cloud. You have to distinguish between basically the applications and infrastructure. In the infrastructure space, this is a capital-intensive space, this is a win-or-take-most space. There's going to be a couple players that win in cloud infrastructure and IaaS. But on the SaaS side, it's not uncommon for a company to have 1,000 different applications. I do think you're going to see hundreds of winners in this SaaS space. So we thought the long-tail opportunity in SaaS, that's the way we look at the space.</p><p>3 things that we would recommend investing alongside of the space that we think will be the dominant themes that you're to see wealth created in the space over the next 5 years. One, experience era. This is one of the areas I think you'll hear a lot of us talk about on the panels and partners today around multi-cloud. This idea that brands want to have a direct relationship with consumers, you're seeing an interest to have that 360 review. So this experience era is going to be important. Data modernization, I think this is driving some of the consolidation you're seeing in the space with Google taking out Looker. Some of the momentum you're seeing with Snowflake and obviously, the acquisition that Salesforce announced here around Tableau. And then the last one is this rise of automation. This idea that the back office needs to be automated as well. These are 20-year systems that haven't really been refreshed.</p><p>So with that as we think about the peak valuations, this is a chart that looks at Salesforce and the Salesforce multiple versus the peers. What you find here is a pretty big gap. Basically, starting the year, Salesforce was at a 2-turn discount to the group. They are now at 5-turn discount to the group, similar to what we saw when the growth stocks peaked in September 2018. And so I think there is that disparity suggests that Salesforce is certainly a name that is one that is high on our list as far as we need to do more work on.</p><p>4 areas as far as we see driving opportunity for Salesforce. One, capitalize on experience era; two, again, data modernization, we think MuleSoft and Tableau could be just really unique assets for them going forward. M&amp;A, I think the Salesforce venture arm is underappreciated by investors. They get the first look in some of the best and early startups out there, and I think that's underappreciated. And last but not least, we do see an opportunity for margin and multiple expansion, again, 5 turns below the average.</p><p>So enough of me talking about the space and Salesforce specifically. I thought it'd be helpful to have John come up, maybe read the -- a safe harbor statement and then kick the thing off this morning. But thank you all for coming.</p><p>JOHN CUMMINGS, SVP OF IR, SALESFORCE.COM, INC.: Thanks, Brent. This is my one job today, it's fantastic. Thanks, everybody, for coming. I think a lot of you knew who I am. I'm John Cummings. I'm the Senior Vice President Investor Relations for Salesforce. And we did this -- a similar event like this last year, and we thought it was fantastic because it really is an opportunity for you all to have a conversation with our customers. And we have always wanted that idea and that opportunity to exist during Dreamforce, which this year is November 19, so put that in your calendars.</p><p>But it's so busy and that event's gotten so big, we really haven't had that opportunity or the opportunity for investors and for you all to have the conversation with customers. So thank you all for coming.</p><p>But it's not about me today. It's about you and about our customers and also -- and the people from Salesforce that are going to be leading that are Polly Sumner and Kori O'Brien, and I'll introduce them in just a second.</p><p>But in forums like this, we might make forward-looking statements, and then those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions, and all those risks, uncertainties and assumptions can be found in our Investor Relations page on our website, salesforce.com/investor.</p><p>So with that, let me invite Polly Sumner to come up and Kori O'Brien. Polly is our Chief Adoption Officer, and I think of Polly as a tip of the spear in sort of our conversations with customers along with Alex Dayon and the rest of management team. And Polly is -- has a dozen years at Salesforce. She, prior to that, was a dozen years at Oracle. So she's been in this industry a long time. She's seen the evolution of what Brent was talking about in this early stages of huge transformation in the industry. So Polly is a great source of knowledge and information on that.</p><p>And along with Polly today is Kori O'Brien, who's our SVP of Alliances and Partners. And Kori, similarly, has an amazing background in the industry. She's been at Salesforce for about 8 years, and prior to that was another 8 years with Oracle and then at BEA before that. And while she was in the middle of running some of those programs at Oracle and BEA, decided to go back and get her law degree. She's a JD with a focus in intellectual property. So a couple of very smart, talented executives here. And thank you, both, for being part of this.</p><p>So, Brent, why don't you take it away, and if there are questions along, this is meant to be a dialogue and a conversation, so feel free to raise your hand, ask questions along the way.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Great. Well, I'll kick things off here. And again, if there are questions in the audience, raise your hand and we'll try and make this interactive. I guess, Polly for you. Let's start out with you. As you think about this cloud journey, we've been talking about cloud for a long time. But maybe give us a starting point. As you think about the customer journey 3, 4 years ago, is it different as you think about how you're engaging with customers, or how you're landing with customers today versus maybe 3, 4 years ago?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER, CHIEF ADOPTION OFFICER, SALESFORCE.COM, INC.: Yes. So as John said, just for a little context, I started in the tech industry in 1977. So that mainframe client/server cloud thing is the history of my career. And during that period, I had a variety of different roles. I'm really passionate about growth, so I have the fortune -- good fortune to have designed a growth plan for Oracle from $1 billion, for those of you who've been around for a while, you know we were stuck when we were there, to $5 billion and we got to $8.5 billion. I was the CEO of a web-based startup in analytics. At the turn when Mark left, I left shortly thereafter, and it's called -- it was called Alphablox and I sold it to IBM. And it is the through-point for IBM company to actually get into the data and the analytics marketplace, and it led to, of course, business objects getting acquired by SAP and et cetera, et cetera. And, of course, everybody knows that today, if you have any conversation with Ginni Rometty, she is super passionate about where they're going with data and analytics. And then I did a little bit of kind of your job in a different way, but it was great. And that was -- I was a consultant for Warburg Pincus here in New York and consulted with them on how companies operate. Because anybody can build a spreadsheet and put some numbers on it that actually comes out and said, \"We should make this investment,\" with all due respect to all of you, but the question is can the salespeople sell? Can the product people actually market? Do they know when it's going to be a feature? What -- how is their outlook going? And that was like a rejuvenation, and then I decided to join Mark. We've known each other since 1987. I actually know -- have known Keith that long too. And so this is kind of a really fun, rejoining of a family of people years ago that we all had a great experience with.</p><p>I've also been sort of the, to be very assertive about it, I've been the face of diversity for the female population of wonderful people who work in Silicon Valley. I've been there since 1981, and I think that's something, just looking at the demographics in this room, that we need to work on in New York City as well. So I guess that's me, and I guess you can tell I'm very -- quite outspoken.</p><p>So cloud journey. So when I started in the tech industry, the big players were all mainframe companies, and they did everything for the client. And we had a huge group of timeshare companies that kind of lost their way in the client/server world. That's true round the world, there used to be [Group Bowl], there used to be Siemens, there used to be ICL, there was a big booming business at Fujitsu and Hitachi and certainly, we know the players in North America beyond IBM who've all disappeared. And they did because they didn't have a long-term, forward-looking outlook, and they missed the technology turns that were coming very rapidly in the market. And that built Silicon Valley and all of the amazing things that we see in the investment community of the companies that brought us through the end of last century and into the first decade in this century.</p><p>And so I see the journey as one that's extremely different. First of all, in all those 40 years, I never consulted with a Board. And I never consulted with -- the CEO did not call Larry Ellison. And they didn't call Scott, and they didn't call Hasso, and they didn't call any other guy, any of us, Microsoft, nobody. Because it wasn't a CEO's agenda to figure out what to do with technology to keep their company for the next 100 years or maybe even for the next 10 years. And so the whole agenda with what is being asked of Salesforce today is remarkably different than it was a dozen years ago. And I think it's for the harbinger of CEOs didn't, many of them -- most of them today, especially outside of the United States, did not have an appreciation or participate in the leadership role in a tech industry that moves 10x as fast as they do. And that is an amazing opportunity, and I think causes that -- some of that gap that we saw in the analysis that you've done, Brent. So the agenda is very, very different.</p><p>Now it's also being driven, in many cases, by boards. The only question that a Board ever asked that included tech in the last century was what are we doing about Y2K? And if it hadn't been for Y2K, they would never ask the question. But today, they're all asking the question, and they bring their leadership teams with the executive committees and the boards together to learn a common language. And they do this hop, skip and a jump up Silicon Valley, and that's where the importance of the asset of the Salesforce venture fund, they come to learn what we're looking at. What are we investing in? Who are the companies that we've seen? They stop at other venture firms. They go and visit Google and they go and visit Apple, and they stop -- they come to Salesforce for a day, and then they go up and they spend some time in that dark zone up there where the sun never shines, in Seattle. And that's kind of the way it's going. And I mean when I say they come -- I mean a week doesn't go by where they don't show up, and they come from all over the world. So I think there's a huge transformation of an education process around what does it take to build to see the future or to bet on the future. And I believe that it's also a big change in leadership. Because the way you lead one of these companies is not what we all learned in graduate school. And the way that you run the business is not the way we learned in graduate school. And that I think is the fundamental kind of juxtaposition of the challenges that makes this cloud journey so different.</p><p>And the last comment that I want to make is, it's all about the user experience. Not -- we talk a lot because our role is the customer experience. That's kind of what CRM is all about. How do we help companies have a better experience for their customers? But in reality, we design our products for you, for the user, right? We don't think about it today, but when you hit that button and download an app from Apple, the App Store, just to use for 20 minutes and then maybe you never use it again, that used to take a team of 10 to 20 people to do that for you because the technology for you to do it yourself including networks and all the wonderful things that we just live and breathe today as consumers, all of that stuff didn't exist. And so I think we really are on yet another huge breakthrough of how we use, consume and think about our relationship with technology in fundamentally a very different way. And if you want to do a cool experiment, just take something that you're trying to do, give your phone to a 8- to 13-year old and have them show you how to do it 8x faster than you know how. And you will get like this fundamental thing that's happening in industry. So I personally believe that it's very, very different and super exciting.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Sure. So, Kori, I'd love to ask you a question here. It sounds like you're engaging now at a much higher level than you were 3, 4 years ago, at the C level, we have this user experience. It sounds like you just attended a partner CEO summit. Maybe walk us through what you're hearing or some of the surprises that kind of came out of that partner summit?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: She ran it. It was her idea. She built the whole thing, it was awesome. So...</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN, SVP, ALLIANCES &amp; PARTNER SALES, AMERICAS, SALESFORCE.COM, INC.: I think if I stop and reflect on a lot of the conversations we had and just what I've seen in the market with our partners, it's that, we're just at the beginning. And it's interesting to say that after Salesforce has been around for almost 2 decades that we're just at the beginning of this journey around transformation. And Polly has mentioned it's a different type of leadership that's required to really take these customers to the next level. And digital transformation for these customers is a heavy lift and yet at the same time one where there's so many options. And when I stop and think about what our partners are investing in, the surprise, I'd say, is just the amount of excitement and the investments that they're making with us to help these customers be successful. We are more hyperfocused on customer success than ever before, and I'm seeing a surgence of new types of partners. We have agencies coming on board, very fast-growing segment of our partner community. We have WPP here in our room with us, Accenture and -- Accenture Interact (sic) [Accenture Interactive] and Deloitte Digital, all really focused in around our marketing side of our platform. And when I look at where marketing is going, there is a whole reengineering of marketing in how we approach our customers out in the market. And our partners are going arm-in-arm with us to really help that revolution.</p><p>When I think about the types of partners that are coming to the table, it's this new breed where we're having this multidimensional partnership showing up. There is no longer this SI/ISV delineation. That's -- those lines are blurring. We have SIs now embarking as ISVs. Deloitte launched their asset solutions group, which is prepackaged solutions that they are taking to market to customers to create repeatability and really help customers get to that next level faster and deliver more quickly.</p><p>I think that the biggest part of the equation for us is how we deliver all this. And the investments our partners are making in terms of building their practices are at an all-time high. We're seeing double-digit growth across almost all of our practices with our partner community. The leveraging Trailhead extensively and the Trailhead is at 15 million badges, thousands of communities. I really think when I stop and think about the partners' investments there, they're actually turning it inside out, they're tricking My Trailhead, leveraging it to enable their own resources. That's really helping to grow the community out there that can deliver success for our customers.</p><p>And last but not least, I'd say, the -- I wouldn't say it's a surprise, I'd say it's something I'm really grateful and excited about, it's just the alignment of cultures. Salesforce culture is a very core part of who we are and we talk about it a lot. But our 1-1-1 model, we delivered a new philanthropic model, right, when we started the company. The 1-1-1 is 1% of our profits, 1% of our product and 1% of our time goes to nonprofits and NGOs. And over 500 of our partners have aligned to that model with us. So I'm really proud of that and excited. It helps us do better in the world together. It helps us do better by our customers. And at the end of the day, we are looking at value platforms together to go to market. We look at diversity and sustainability and how can we take that to market to really make the world a better place. So it's been a really exciting part of my job.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: So let's take it from this opportunity discussion to a little bit more of an economic discussion, which we're getting a lot more feedback from investors around some concerns, right? You have trade, you have concerns on the economy, things slow. We've had this Brexit concern for a long time, and we haven't really seen it impact software sales yet. But what do you think from a partner and a customer perspective around this economic uncertainty? Are you seeing anyone pull back plans from either a customer or a partner perspective yet? What's your perspective on the noise out there, the risk out there? And then does that change plans around pace of this cloud digital transformation journey?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: So one of my roles at Salesforce has been the Executive Committee member to help build our international business. So maybe I take it from a little bit of an international view, and you chime in and we'll try to segment it a little bit that way. As a matter of fact, I just came from 3 weeks in Europe on Monday. So first of all, I think that the pace of innovation is very different in North America than the pace of innovation internationally. Europe is more conservative and always has been. I think -- I was just with Hitachi yesterday. The big giants internationally are realizing that they have no clue who their customer is. Many of them are holding company conglomerates that look like a Procter &amp; Gamble or look they are very diversified portfolios. And they've lost touch, and so the fear, uncertainty, doubt kind of mentality is definitely there. And they definite -- and they also -- but they're looking at it as an imperative. It's actually driving the imperative for them to understand who their customer is and to build a relationship with them, which is a fantastic opportunity for Salesforce. It's also one where I think the slowness or any slowness that we see is actually the ability for this -- for any company to transform because it has to change its people. We have to change the way we work. We have to change the way we manage. And so that is depending on what the company is, and I think we should ask the customers that are here today and partners what they're seeing in that way, but they come and they're asking us more and more and more the how question. How do I take somebody who, quite frankly, is over 40 and get them excited about technology? How do I take my very complex matrix organization and work processes in a style that's Japanese and learn to compete in the rest of the world? And so they're picking very carefully the partners for their future. And that I think is a partnership with Salesforce or other companies that they're selecting, some of the names that are on your charts, which is why I think this growth at scale is so important. But they're taking that and it's all trust based. So the faster we can build trust with our clients and work together to achieve their vision, their future, the better off and faster and the more of that -- this cycle is actually in our control. I think the business model helps when you think about per user pricing and a subscription model. The predictability is an advantage. Certainly, there are accounting rules where people would like to spend CapEx instead of spending OpEx. But the price of Salesforce for a salesperson to change your sales organization's relationship with a customer or your service organization's relationship with your customer is less than the price for your employee to take your customer -- their customer to a nice restaurant. So when you think about how people are like looking at it, in aggregate, it might be a big long-term commitment in spend, but inside of the operating expense in the existing quarter, it's really quite manageable. And on the B2C side, the effectivity of advertising rates and the whole shift that we've seen in the media and the ad industry, that's already -- like, that's proven. And there are other players in there. So I think the slowdown is -- if there comes one significantly, is our ability with our teams and our partners to actually address the people change transformation that's required to actually get this -- get the customer over the hump, quite frankly. That's what I think it is more than any serious Brexit or financial woes or whatever.</p><p>Now the macroeconomics will have an impact. There's never a change about that. But what would you do if you were a car manufacturer? I mean you could argue that there will never be more cars on the road in the world today than there are right now. Because whole economies are, we're all sharing cars, one car. So what does that mean? So I have kind of a bit of a hypothesis that we've been working on with some of our innovation teams around unbundling. If you think about an insurance policy, I don't buy it for my car when it sits in the garage. Insurance, I insure experiences for the moment. And that would be an example of an entire industry that has to reassemble itself around an entirely different experience in usage concept than what that industry was founded on 300 years ago. So that's occurring in every industry. And understanding that is fundamental to the way you execute and operate your business, your -- like Salesforce. But it also creates this land of opportunity that the -- that has the potential to be a winner-take-all the same way it was in the client/server era and what we saw exiting the last century.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Thanks, Polly. So I'm not an economics major. But what I will say is that regulatory change and macroeconomic conditions are consistently a struggle throughout the year -- or throughout the years. And our partners come up with amazing solutions for our customers to help them get through those times. We continue to evaluate things like GDPR and make sure that we are working through the latest and greatest to bring our customers to where they need to be. Our partners, when I think about the reference of the slowdown or anything, we need 250,000 consultants by 2022. I'm not looking at any slowdown right now. I'm looking at that saying, we have more demand than capacity and we are working really hard to fill that. I guess that we had double-digit growth. Our partners are laser-focused on building up that capacity and ensuring that we can deliver the type of competency that we need for those customers to help them get through anything.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Super helpful. We have time for maybe one last question. Any burning questions from the audience before I can ask my last question here? Perfect. We'll go and then, obviously, bring customers to hear the customers perspective, but before you leave, one last one. What are you most excited about this year?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: This year?</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: This year. What are you most excited about this year?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: I have the great pleasure of working with our team that decides the stories for Dreamforce and these ones are going to knock your socks off.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: We have an advertisement for Dreamforce. November 19 was it, John? Go ahead.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: I'm really excited about our continued investment in industry. It helps us align with our partners. We've launched 2 products, Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud, which have seen explosive growth with 2 more to come. I think that they're really the way for us to go to our customers with a very tailored message, speak their language and continue to deliver value like we never have before.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Great. Well, really appreciate your insights. We'll be back up here with the customer panel in about 5 minutes. Thank you.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Can you turn the lights on, please? Thank you. Through the forum, this is really about you, so I took the liberty of just sending a note out to a few of our teammates at Salesforce and ask them to nominate some customers who they thought had great stories and experiences and you would be interested in them. So we have with us 3 people who have, as you can see, very different backgrounds. And we're just going to start off, and I'm going to ask them to introduce themselves and then tell us a little bit about the firm that they represent and then we'll maybe do another round with what are you doing with Salesforce, et cetera, et cetera. And then it's up to you to ask any questions that you want until the buzzer goes off and we tromp down off the stage. So, Barry, let's start with you. Can you tell us a little bit about Deluxe and yourself? And that would be great.</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: Absolutely. Well, good morning. I'm Barry McCarthy, and I'm the new CEO of a company called Deluxe. I took the role about 7 months ago. You would know Deluxe historically as a check printer, but the company, over the last handful of years, has diversified pretty significantly and is now a leading provider of small business services, digital marketing and enablement services for financial institutions and others. But the company has not operated to its maximum potential. So over the last handful of years, the company made 52 different acquisitions that were unintegrated. So I've been the great beneficiary of a great footprint with great opportunity, but lots of work ahead of us to try to bring together what we're calling one Deluxe, where we can talk to our customers about the entirety of our solutions. Rather than having 52 different relationships with a customer, we want to have a single relationship where we can solve their problems. And in a few minutes, we'll talk about how excited we are about the Salesforce partnership.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Maybe just to give people an idea of the size because we talked about scale in the first presentation. How many small businesses do you serve? And what are their demographics?</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: Absolutely. So just tell you a little about the company overall. The company is a $2 billion company. It's 105 years old, it has $500 million of EBITDA. The customers that we serve, we serve 5 million small businesses, which we think gives us an extraordinary footprint in the small business community. What's really compelling about it is, 3.5 million of those 5 million inbound contact us annually to buy something, not as a result of our marketing, but because the nature of the services we provide. They're reordering something, they're extending a relationship, et cetera. We also support about 4.5 million small business websites. We think we're one of the largest hosters of small business websites and provide a set of solutions everything from birth to growth for small businesses. We also support about 4,800 financial institutions. And for those of you that may think checks are past their prime, there's still 100,000 of you a day that receive a package from us of printed checks. So there's still billions and hundreds of billions of dollars a year that are processed on paper checks, but obviously, we're positioning the company not to -- not only to continue to do a great job with that, but to transform for the digital future.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Awesome. Okay. Let's change topics a little bit and let's go to Cornell University. And, Becky, can you tell us a little bit your career? And what you guys are doing at Cornell? And how education's changing?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Sure. So Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New York, but we -- and we have campus on Roosevelt Island, the new Cornell Tech campus and also Weill Cornell, which is a medical school -- medical center also in New York City. We are the home of 22,000 very high expectation talented individuals and we are trying very hard to align the organizational infrastructure with those expectations, and that's where CRM comes in. Before Cornell, I worked at -- so I'm the IT Innovation Officer, and I'm leading what's called the Cornell Student Experience Initiative. We also have a corporate relations initiative that is starting to spread up. Before Cornell, I worked at Dartmouth College in the business school and before that, I worked at Nestl\u00e9. And...</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: And where did you go to school?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: I went to American University undergrad and the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth for an MBA. And I will say that education extremely, extremely important these days.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes. Great. And what do you think about the role of tech in education? How are you leveraging technology at Cornell?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: So higher ed is really interesting because it is, what I would call a tarball of business model. It is -- we are in the fund raising business, we're in the admissions business, we're in the student life cycle business, we're in the research business. And so IT and technology is in the middle of all this trying to figure out a service model and a technology -- strategy that will scale, and that is very, very complex. And so that's I think where our focus is.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great, super. All right. And Charlie, we really owe you a special thanks. I mean this is an amazing very special day for Major League Soccer and of course, the parade is going on right now. So we can't thank you enough. And I'd like to have a special round of applause for Charlie and his team. All right. So tell us a little bit about MLS maybe, a little bit about...</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Absolutely. Well, thank you. My name is Charlie Shin, Vice President of the Strategy &amp; Analytic with Major League Soccer. I've been with the League for about 13 years, mostly overseeing a lot of the data strategies and marketing technology infrastructure developments at the League, part-time MLS. Worked at consulting for about 7, 8 years within the CRM practice with PwC consultings, IBM business consultings and so on. So very familiar with the landscape of CRM, lived through the era of [CBLs and e-tisseries] back then. Great to see that Salesforce kind of having survived and come all the way to where they are now.</p><p>Part of the department really focuses on development of our customers. And at Major League Soccer, just to give you a little bit of information for those that are not familiar with our League. We're a first division professional soccer league in North America. We have 24 clubs across Canada and U.S. We have 3 teams in Canadian markets, 21 teams in U.S. We have 3 new teams coming onboard next year as well as the following year, so we have team in Miami, Nashville and then Austin. We've also announced that we would have 28 teams by '22 as well as looking to expand 2 more clubs down the line to reach total of 30 clubs. So we're definitely growing, the sports is growing. As mentioned that we're celebrating the success of the woman's national team winning the World Cup today. So rising tide lifts all boats, so it's great to see the success of the sports in this country.</p><p>Technology plays a crucial part. We've taken on a journey for about 5, 6 years ago to become more fan-centric organization, and in doing so technology has played a crucial role. And ever since we've been working closely with Salesforce in helping and collaborating to leverage the technology to help us become more fan-centric.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Thank you for that. So Barry, can we go back to you. I made some conjecture about what's on the minds of CEOs, and it's what they tell me. But maybe a little bit from you in your role as a CEO, doing a transformation of a company, working with the hairballs integration in these 55 companies that you've acquired. Can you just share with our audience a little bit about how you're parsing that problem, and then what role does Salesforce play in actually the transformation of your company?</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: Absolutely. So this -- I think it's probably common for every business, but our biggest challenge and the most important thing we're working on is revenue growth. And that's why the company acquired all of these other assets before I joined the company. But in order to unlock that potential and that opportunity, our company needed to think of a way to understand the customer more holistically and be able to approach the market as one company. I give you an example. On the very first day that I joined the company, which was the 26th of November, it's the Monday after Thanksgiving. On the very first day, our fifth largest customer called us and said, \"We would like to extend our relationship with you on one part of our business in check.\" And I said to them, \"Well, of course, we'd love to do that. We can't give you the price decline that you're looking for, but let's grow the relationship between our companies and we can find a way to put, to come together and do a deal with you,\" I happened to know the COO of the bank from a -- my former role. And I said to the CEO -- or the COO of the bank said to me, \"But there's nothing else that Deluxe sells, there's nothing else that Deluxe makes that we would be interesting in buying.\" And I said to the CEO, \"But that just isn't true. You know us from checks, but you don't know about all these other -- these 50 other acquisitions we've made. All these problems we solve for small business customers. How we help your clients grow, maybe we should talk about that.\" And the COO of this -- of our fifth largest customer says to me, \"Well, I just -- I had no idea. Your sales people don't know what all that you have, and this is the first time that you told me that you had all of these things available. How come we're not talking about all these other things that we can do? Strategic direction for us is to reduce the number of vendors, do more with fewer.\" I said, \"Absolutely, let's find a way to do a deal.\" Within that week we were able to close that transaction with a commitment for a multimillion-dollar expansion of our relationship because we could talk, and I was the new guy on my first day on the job. And I could talk to the customer about the breadth and depth of what we could offer.</p><p>So it really started a pretty rapid cascade of decisions in my very first days at the company because I had the same conversation over and over and over again in my introductory calls with our clients, where they didn't understand our company, our company didn't understand our company well enough and it represented this extraordinary opportunity to have a different relationship with our customer, who will tell the entirety of our story and in doing so help us accelerate our revenue growth. So we went really quickly to start looking at what we could do to get a great, best-in-class customer relationship set of tools.</p><p>I should tell you that one of the things I first found out is that our company was operating 34 different customer relationship systems from 52 different acquisitions. So there's no wonder that we didn't have one integrated view of the customer and the customer didn't have one integrated view of us. So very, very quickly we went to work, we did a lot of analysis, talked to lots of potential partners, including many that we already had relationships with. And we decided to partner with Salesforce not only because we believe the tools were best-in-class but we thought that they had a suite of solutions that went even beyond CRM to help us run our business and the commerce portion of our businesses, in particular, so that we could go to market as an integrated whole. Salesforce had the same vision for what a customer relationship should look like as I had and our company had for what we want it to be. So became a pretty obvious choice that Salesforce was the right partner, and then they came to the table and were great partners for us to help to put together a deal.</p><p>I will tell you there was a pretty exciting conversation at my first-ever Board meeting to tell my new -- not my new Board, I was the new guy, that I was going to make such a significant commitment for the company with a single partner at Salesforce. It was a very long, spirited dialogue over dinner, and we got to conclusion that this was not only the right thing for the company to be investing in but this was the right partner for our future because our company is 100 years old. We're not trying to build a company for the next couple of years, we're trying to build a company that's going to go for the next 100 years. And we wanted to have a partner that could help us navigate that future, and we were very pleased with -- and very pleased with our early results.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Well, thank you for that. Rebecca, can you maybe a little bit from the lens of somebody who deeply understands technology, the importance of mobility, can you talk a little bit about maybe just how you think from a bit of a business and technology lens about the architectures that are going to support Cornell for the future, including mobile? And sort of what you guys are up to and what your vision is around that?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Sure. So higher ed IT has not -- is not used to being in the front lines of the customer experience. That's not a space where the IT organization has played. They have been in the back end with administrative applications and ERP systems and things like that. So this space is new. And also the idea of customer service is very new to higher ed. The -- there's not a company in the world that would have 20,000 high-paying customers and not have a CRM. And yet many universities and colleges are still asking, do we need this class of technology? And I think higher ed, at Cornell we'd moved beyond that question, thank goodness, because you just -- you can't function without really think about those end-user experiences. There is no way with the disruption going on in higher ed and the expectations, you cannot move the needle with the status quo. You have to deploy this kind of technology. So that's the role that technology plays. And now that we're in that space, there's just, how do you -- how do you make this work? Which audience are you going to focus on? There's lot of directions we could go. At Cornell, we've chosen to start with the student experience. It was the easiest argument to make to. We have 14 colleges and everybody needs to align, and that is also a unique thing in a higher ed institution where very independent minds, everybody going off in their own direction. And so we went to our provost and said, \"We cannot have 14 different customer experiences. We need a single customer experience.\" And so bringing that alignment to campus is magical. Deploying the technology is one thing but when you hit on an idea that truly gets everybody moving in the same direction. We had people in the advising space -- student advising in colleges who'd never met each other; the CRM meetings were the first time they came together to really talk about best practices for advising and how do we do that. And so our focus, we've picked 2 areas to start with: one is advising and the second is student activities. So it's sort of co-curricular things going on. Students go abroad, they do research, they do these immersive learning experiences. And at Cornell, every time a student had a goal, they had to figure out which website to go to. We didn't have this personal experience where I'm an engineering student who speaks Chinese, what should I do? What's available to me? And one student said, they called Cornell a treasure hunt. They said, \"Well, it's really lucky that the end of 4 years I found some of these experiences,\" but we don't want to rely on luck. And so that space has been really interesting because from a CRM standpoint, what we're trying to get our heads around is how do you enable not just the big student life cycle journey as an institution, but how do you enable all the micro-journeys. And so we put, just to tell you how it practically is playing out, it's sort of a three-pronged strategy. We have our CMS upfront, which is critical. You have to draw people in, especially students, you have to draw them in with content. And so using a content management system as the front end, we had a site called Experience Cornell and students can go and find all these opportunities in one place, no longer going to all these websites, they can find it. And then beyond that then, they need to engage. And so for any program when they click on apply, they're going to Salesforce. And that is where we capture the engagement and we can start to understand the micro-journey, help students along that path, and so that paring for us is really critical. And then the third prong is mobile. Students obviously expect mobile experiences, I cannot tell you. So I started with Salesforce 9 years ago at Dartmouth College. I was the first person to use Salesforce with students in a student-facing way. We really wanted a mobile experience, and that was 9 years ago. I can't imagine now not having a mobile experience. And yet with mobile publishers, this is the first time we can offer students mobile. The challenge was, you cannot tell a student to go download Salesforce 1 as their mobile app. We needed a branded app. And so mobile publisher has been really key to that.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great. And what's the third pillar?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: That is it, CMS, CRM and mobile publisher.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Awesome. Terrific. So you mentioned, Charlie, that you're on kind of a shift from -- or one of your strategies is building clubs. And that's certainly a march that you've become very good at, as witnessed by the numbers. But the second want -- part was, what are you doing about, like, a shift to a fan experience. Can you tell us a little bit about what that means? And if I was a fan, what would my experience be with MLS and the way you're moving the company?</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Absolutely. Just like any other industries, there's a lot of disruptions that's happening in sports. And the -- over the years when we all talk about sports, a lot of times that discussion is really focused on the players and the quality of the competition. But what we're realizing is that we're competing for the same time that other industries are competing for, the Netflix, whether it's the restaurant and sort of -- any other entertainment or experience customer. So we have to now start focusing on delivering a best experience possible for our fans. And that starts with understanding who our fans are. So we've done an extensive study to understand the market. What is the segmentation of our customers for soccer consumption and understanding that and drilling down in terms of key segments to identify the needs? What is the motivation that is driving those consumptions? And now what we're doing is, based on the understanding of those needs, how do we deliver those needs? Then it comes back to, especially for a league where we're relatively young versus some of the other professional leagues out there, it's all about how do we scale and then drive that engagement so that we are able to deliver the needs of our fans. And that's where a lot of the technology comes into play. We're leveraging the technology to be able to reach the audiences that are out there that are interested in our sports and want to engage. And also, we have to understand that the fans are fan of the club and not the league, so we needed to kind of define what is our role as a league pertaining to the customer engagement and what we could do. So we kind of see ourselves as a B2B2C model, where -- how do we support our clubs, so that our clubs could have a better engagement with our fans. And especially from a technology standpoint, that comes back to having a very efficient infrastructure. So rather than having individual clubs make that investment, how can we create a platform that can be leveraged by our clubs so they don't have to have a massive resource behind the back ends or technologies but it's more about someone that needs to just take what we've built and go and execute. So we built this centralized infrastructure from our data warehousing institute. Marketing Cloud, we offer the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to all of our clubs. They are able to leverage that. We have special partnership with Salesforce in terms of their Sales Cloud for each of our clubs to use as their CRM tools. And then we use CMPs for helping us reach a broader audience. And that's some of the technology we're currently leveraging. And the best part of the relationship that we've had with Salesforce is the path that we kind of have evolved over the years. We started our relationship with ExactTarget. So prior to Salesforce acquired the solution because we wanted to work with the technology that was able to provide us with a platform to build out engagement with our customers to provide more personalized and better experience. That has led to, after Salesforce acquiring, the technology kind of continuing that relationship. And then we were looking at Krux to see that how can we reach greater audience using some of the CMP technologies to reach our unknowns and use that to build an engagement. And then happened to see that Salesforce make that acquisition, and that was great. We were like, \"Now I don't need to worry about the integration.\" And that took place. We're looking at -- we've been looking at Tableau for a lot of our reporting, and now Salesforce goes and acquires Tableau. So I feel like they are kind of working hand-in-hand in terms of looking at the best tools out there and then kind of working on that integration. It kind of takes the lift out of my efforts. So it's great to see some of that foresight in all the work that they're doing to evolve just beyond what they started with and expanding into building a platform that's all about the customer.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Right. Great. Well, thank you for that. Barry, you mentioned integration. And I know we had our team while we're on the theme of acquisitions and rest of it. You did some thinking about what role MuleSoft would play, and how you would do an integration and what you're going to do with these different properties that you have and how you're going to offer it. Can you just share a little bit about that perspective? And then Rebecca, I'm coming to you with sort of the same question, and we'll open it up to everybody.</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: So when you have 52 unintegrated acquisitions, you have a pretty significant opportunity to simplify and streamline your operation. And so all of the tools, MuleSoft and other Salesforce tools, we really saw as a shortcut to get us to where we wanted to be. Which was a way for us to accelerate the transformation and the consolidation of the entire experience of how customer experiences us and we experience customers. So we have third parties helping us do the implementations and help us get across that finish line quickly. I will tell you that some of the very earliest feedback, we're only a few months into this now, is incredibly compelling because on -- very quickly we can start to see the opportunities where we have a customer that has a clear gap, a clear opportunity for us to deliver additional service or we can also begin to see where a customer may be at risk of attrition and give us the opportunity to go and try to address it before we have a different conversation. So it's great.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Good. Early pay off, that's all. Rebecca, could I ask you to describe your team? You did a great job of talking about the challenge of the students but what about the people, like, just, what are the roles that are on the team that empowers this to happen at an educational institution? Because it's quite different than the way we think about corporate America than it is for institutions in education.</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Because this class of technology is new in higher ed, you don't always get the buy-in from senior leadership and the investment needed to hire a full team. And so we're very proud that we got 1 of everything, 1 Salesforce admin, 1 PM, 1 business analyst and 1 tech lead. And so we have a team of about 4 people, which is very, very small. That was our first 2 years of building out this student initiative and proving the value of CRM. Now that we are there, we're making more than $1 million investment to lean in and to really staff up. And we're sitting here now going, \"Okay, now how do we do this? We're in Ithaca. How do we get the talent that we need? How -- what's our vendor strategy?\" And I'm excited about the vendor panel because I've got so many opinions about how that world is changing and how it can help customers in better ways. And so somebody said on the earlier panel that you need to just really separate -- maybe it was KeyBanc -- the application layer from the infrastructure layer. In our first 2 years, those were really merged together. And so our job right now is to separate that and to really understand what are applications and what is infrastructure to get the infrastructure people to stop focusing on applications because they're just not that good at this and to get the application people to understand how infrastructure works, because the application people are used to web sites and they stand up all these separate websites and create a lot of technical debt. And so that's where our struggle is, and we will staff along those lines.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. So super. I think every probably knows that Salesforce has a commitment to produce 3 million jobs in the market. And so these are just an example of 4 of those jobs that are created by Salesforce, so I thought that was really great for you to share that.</p><p>Charlie, what about your team? I mean you've been using Salesforce for quite some time. I think it was -- it's a great story of a journey. What's evolved and changed over that sort of 9-year period that you might want to share with the audience?</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Sure. I mean in terms of organization, we tend to use great partners that Salesforce has. So we do go externally to work with the companies that provide, whether it's an implementation or day-to-day service. And there -- it's efficient in terms of how we operate in, given the limited resource that we have internally, what we try to do is focus on some of the strategies and execution from our side and then work with great partners that's out their that's been helpful in terms of implementing this technology as well as addressing any kind of issues that might exist.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great. Okay. Open questions to the audience. Brent?</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: I'll take it up here. Barry, obviously, you're still early in implementation here, but I don't understand the logic of why you decided to go wall-to-wall with Salesforce and -- versus like the best of breed at different silos. If you figure that -- and why did you have level-set wall-to-wall with Salesforce?</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: Absolutely. So think about the challenge that I have inherited, 52 different operating companies. The company is a company of companies, not a company of product. I have 1 opportunity. I had 1 opportunity in my role as the CEO of this company to fundamentally rethink the technology architecture of our company, our go-to-market strategy, how we're going to manage customers, et cetera. And so we took that opportunity to be pretty disciplined and thoughtful about how we wanted to go to market and where we wanted to go. And so we did think [and sort of fair but as] time thinking about could we piece together many different pieces and maybe put together something that would be unique for our experience, for our circumstance. And we concluded that we certainly have the tactical capability to do that, but that wasn't the outcome that we wanted. We wanted a much more integrated, seamless experience for the entire organization and for how our customer experience is and how we went to market. And so the conclusion was it'll be much better for us to choose one partner and go much deeper with that one partner across multiple aspects of our business. So we wouldn't have to worry about the interfaces and spend time and resource and very scarce time, it's really about time, to try to make the pieces work together. Instead we can buy and implement a solution that's an end-to-end answer for many of our problems and customize from there to deliver the outcome we need.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: If you look at the price of the bundle solution versus (inaudible), did price have anything to do with the decision to standardize on wall-to-wall? Or...</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: Price is, of course, obviously always a consideration, right? But we really started with the end in mind, with what is the company we are trying to build. What is the company and what are we trying to become, and we let that be our guiding light. I will tell you though that clearly at the end of the day, it's clearly about dollars and cents, right? And we found this -- the complete suite for how we were going to use it was a very compelling value proposition and economic proposition as well.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Questions? Yes. At the back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just following up on that price point. Most SaaS businesses, Salesforce included, when it comes time to renewal they'll give you an opportunity you can either increase prices on what you have or you can add seats, extend services. How much of a factor is that in extending the relationship because I assume this -- if your experience has been different, then please say so, but you can increase price on what you already have or if you add seats then we'll keep prices the same. How much a -- how big a factor is that in adding to the Salesforce relationship, that dynamic?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: So we've -- you've renewed once or twice, Charlie, right?</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Yes.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Can you just give your experience? I'm sorry, but this is brand new. So sorry, I mean, excuse me for making sure I directed it to the right person. Charlie? I'm never asking this question. I'm going to learn right along with you.</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Sure. It's always -- it's definitely a big consideration because it impacts your bottom line and your budget. But in terms of what we felt that we were getting from the Salesforce was that there were these constant value-adds that were coming with that increase, whether it was additional functionalities or other products that made us reduce some of the cost on the integrations or. Yes, so it was a -- definitely we've seen the value. If we were -- it was a status quo and there's nothing and that the price just continue to increase, they'll be like, \"All right, this is enough,\" but I mean we're constantly seeing the values in other areas that justify some of those increases that we've seen. So that has helped us.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Rebecca, do you want to make a comment about that with your experience at Dartmouth and Cornell?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Yes. So higher ed owes a great debt to Salesforce for that higher ed Salesforce.org relationship that provides higher ed with discounted licensing. And so we are still very, very, very conscious of price. But I think that sort of $10 billion and the $10 trillion marketplace has a lot to do with the learning curve both of Cornell and the new spaces that Salesforce is going into. So we started with CRM, now we're moving into Marketing Cloud and then Einstein Analytics. And so that journey, as you mature, your CRM strategy introduces the need for newer products. In the end, cost, as a net, should go down based on -- in -- at Cornell, anyway, we spent a lot of money building custom apps over and over. The end goal with Salesforce is you've got a suite of tools and you're creating customer journeys. With out-of-the-box toolsets, you're not creating custom apps all the time. And so that's where I hope to see the balance, but we need to complete our stack of available tools to meet all these different markets that we compete in from research, to faculty, to students, to admissions. Once we get that stack complete, maybe then we can start increasing our spend.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes. Okay. Great.</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: So we, probably, it was in 90 days we had sort of the first version. We didn't roll it out across the whole broad organization, but very quickly we were able to import data and start getting to this sort of first view of customer. We were very pleased with the speed of the implementation. I can give you more -- a few more months as we roll it out across the boarder organization. On the ROI question, Salesforce is a significant commitment. It's a significant financial commitment, it's a big financial decision for our organization to make. And we believe the ROI is pretty easy to calculate in a couple of ways: first of all, there's just the simple math of shutting down many different competing systems and getting to one. So there's -- just a clear -- there's -- that's easy, that's easy math. But the more important math that's much more intriguing for me and for our company is how it's going to help us transform our revenue growth rate and the ability to sell more product to our existing customers. A lot of businesses have a challenge where they just don't have enough customers to talk to, and they're spending tens of millions of dollars annually to get a customer to contact them. That's not our challenge. I have 3.5 million of them calling me, texting me, using 1 of my multiple web properties to contact me. I just don't know them well enough to know what is the next best product to sell to them because I don't have a completely integrated view of the relationship. And that's why Salesforce is so central to our strategy of cross-selling to our existing base because we think these tools will give us a huge jump start to transforming our company.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Anybody else want to comment?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: First, the build phase or the startup phase is about 2 years, and I talk to a lot of higher ed institutions and I think that's true. You need to build something, prototype it, then it needs to stabilize and then you have to roll it out to all the different units, and so that's the cycle for us.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: And Charlie, how about an example of a club maybe? And how quickly they get enabled? And then what's your role there?</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: It's pretty quick for the clubs to get something implemented and up and running. And as I've mentioned, a lot of these clubs don't have a huge resource behind the IT. So it's definitely helpful in terms of the tool makes it easy for them to kind of get it up and running as fast as possible. And then ROI, I mean, the efficiency that the tool provides and especially at the club level, it's about selling your tickets and getting people to the stadiums. And it helps manage their engagement, which will lead to a greater retention and that leads to a higher lifetime value for their season ticket holders or any of the ticket buyers. So definitely they have seen some great success managing that process. Because in the past, believe it or not, it was all done manually, right? Using a lot of Excel sheets or contact lists and all that stuff. So...</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: [Allen mentioned] what I said a little bit because it is -- when something is built and figured out, the rollout is very, very quick. And I will say also the great thing about Salesforce is, it works every time. We go live with something and we wait for phone calls, and there are none. So a lot of it is just about training, not about the technology, which is nice.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes, questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Charlie, you mentioned that you've taken a look at Tableau, and I'm just kind of curious if -- generally it's been sold on a team level or business unit. Is this something that you are contemplating doing enterprise-wide? And do you think Salesforce owning Tableau makes it a more compelling product? And if so, why?</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: So we are kind of looking at very similar approach that we've taken for all of our technology platforms with the Marketing Cloud and Sales Cloud in terms of centralizing it and providing it to our clubs. We actually use SaaS analytics as our main analytics solutions for the league, and that's also centralized and provide excess to all of our clubs.</p><p>In terms of Tableau, I think the benefit is the integration. We mentioned the importance of becoming a fan-centric organization, and that starts with understanding our fans. And that's about having the best rich data about our fans and consolidating it. And it comes back to having a technology that's integrated well enough to get those datas flowing through different platforms that exist out there. So integration has been the key piece and the center of our strategy in terms of thinking about different platforms or tools out there. So having that work being done through Salesforce in terms of, we mentioned about ExactTarget, Krux, these are all the technology platforms that they were able to integrate into the existing, the Sales Cloud. And that takes the burden on (sic) [off] our hands because otherwise we would have had to gone out into the market and try to figure out how we build and connect those systems together. So I'm hoping that will be the case in terms of the Tableau having that integration that's -- makes it easy for us to flow all of our datas through and have that be kind of the reporting tool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I'm just wondering, were there more vertical-specific solutions that you guys evaluated when you were looking at Salesforce? And why maybe choose a more horizontal solution versus a vertical specific one?</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: Vertical solutions are the bane of our existence in higher ed because you end up with all these things that you just can't knit together and you cannot get analytics, you cannot marry these data models. And so that's what we're resisting. The next mental leap we had to make, so every unit wants their own vertical solution, their own fundraising, higher ed specific, Ed Tech thing, so we had to overcome that. Then the second thing we had to overcome is every unit deploying Salesforce independently as a point solution because that also is a mess. And so the challenge is a single CRM system where you get that 360 view and you can get really rich analytics. And that's the ROI. Workflow automation is wonderful, but without those analytics, you really aren't -- you're just spending a lot to automate bad business process. You want the analytics to feed the journey of the constituents.</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: Well, fortunately, I don't think there's any sports vertical solutions out there. So I don't think there were any other considerations, but this is something I do want the Salesforce to kind of think about is that despite not having a vertical solution, there are companies out there that have a vertical, we call it, a specialist or a industry account managers, right? So someone who understands our business that they could translate into their product. Unfortunately, I don't think the Salesforce has any sports vertical kind of specialist. And I think that's something that we've been asking for and something I think they could do and kind of use that as starting points to see how they could better serve, because I mean we all talk about importance of personalization from a consumer standpoint. Well, that applies to kind of B2B business as well, right? So we have our very different life cycle and customer management process for our industries and constantly, we have to -- we know our industries, but we might not know the tools as well. And so how can we have someone who could kind of bring that gap together to help us best utilize the technologies as well as someone who understands our business so we don't have to constantly explain to them about what that is.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Thanks, Charlie. That's always one of my favorite questions is what can we do better. So Barry, you want to comment?</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: I want going to add to that, that our company, we have multiple verticals. We sell to small banks, medium-sized banks, large banks. We sell to credit unions, we sell to small businesses, enterprise-class businesses, nail salons, hat shops, physical stores, online stores. So our portfolio of businesses is very diverse. That's one of our company's greatest strengths. And so we didn't -- we couldn't really think about, well, are we going to have something that's great for banks or are we going to have something that's great for community banks. We need something that is universal, that can be used across our entire portfolio of millions of businesses.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Okay. I think we're about to close it up. And I just have one question for you. If you are going to say, I don't know, a sentence to me about what you'd like to see from Salesforce, so we can learn and we actually have a couple of our team here that are doing -- that do the research and listening. Can you guys just share, Charlie, you start it, by saying, give me a little expertise around my industry, we do have a lot of sports franchises, that was a great suggestion. Barry and Rebecca, could you say what you think?</p><p>BARRY MCCARTHY;DELUXE;CEO: I think as we scale our no go to -- our new go-to-market model, the ability to learn best practices from others, so that we could accelerate our own transformation even faster. I think we get some of that but we think even more of that would be fantastic.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Awesome.</p><p>REBECCA JOFFREY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;IT INNOVATION OFFICER: How about some power account? It's incredibly important for society. Not just the coasts, the elite institutions but all of higher ed. We really need that, and so -- and that means beyond just your sales process. It means really thinking creatively about how to empower talent, whether it's scholarships, investing in research, chairing -- professor chairs. How we empower faculty, all of that I think is critically, critically important. I would love nothing more than at Dreamforce to see Mark Benninghoff talk about the Internet of talent. I know you extend internet as a customer and all those things but I think in the end it's all about talent.</p><p>CHARLIE SHIN;MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER; VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STRATEGY &amp; ANALYTIC: I do want to give credit to Salesforce because I had my first Dreamforce experience couple of years ago and I was blown away by the -- not just the shared number of participants but the culture that I've noticed. And we talk about the customer experience and that's something that we're trying to foster in sports in terms of our fans and what they do and how we could help them build that culture. That's what I saw with Salesforce is that not only they had a great product, but they built this culture among the users that were proud of being a Salesforce developers or users, or they were excited. And all the engagement, interaction that they were having with their peers was like, I've never seen anything like it in any other kind of conferences or other places. And I felt like, wow, this is different in terms of the culture that you guys were able to build. So...</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Let's give these guys a great round of applause and thank you very much. And we're going to make a shift now and take a break, right? Is that correct? Okay? Get some coffee. And next we're going to have 4 partners to get their experiences.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Right. Guys, we're going to get started if everybody could take their seats. Thank you, all. We're going to get started here with the partner panel. Appreciate everyone sitting down. Why don't we start off with a quick introduction down the line so everyone knows who's on the panel. This is, as I say, all my brothers from another mother. So really excited to have them here with us today. Why we're going to kick off with you, Robert?</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Good morning, everyone. Robert Wollan. I'm the Global Managing Director at Accenture. I lead all of our front office business, and I spent my whole career in the front office. So CEO, CMO, CFO, all that kind of good stuff.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Rich Lyons. I head up digital customer experience for Capgemini from North America. I'm also the Global Offer Leader for Commerce. I came over about a year and 8 months ago from an acquisition of my company, Lyons Consulting Group, which focused on commerce.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: Nelson Kunkel, Chief Design Officer for Deloitte Digital. Leading our global experience studio network in parallel with building our sales force practice.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: I'm Gireesh Sonnad. I'm co-founder and CEO of Silverline. We are a 10 -year-old Salesforce Platinum SI, headquartered right here in New York City, focusing on the client services and healthcare space.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Josh Pierry, part of WPP, one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. I fall within the Wunderman Thompson group. My company originally was Pierry, and I sold to them at the end part of 2017.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Great. Thanks so much for joining us, you guys. There's been a lot of conversation around digital transformation. And with the fact that at least 70% of our implementations are done with partners, you guys see a lot. The deals are getting bigger. We are excited about the innovation that's in front of us with our customers. Talk to me a little bit -- start down here with Accenture, our oldest and biggest partner around some of our most complex deals. Talk to me a little bit about how this is impacting your business and what you see.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, it's interesting. I mean the word digital transformations isn't a new term. We've been talking about it all morning, as the group said. We see it as a huge opportunity still ahead, probably in 2 different dimensions. One is the 2 ends of the spectrum, meaning the folks who are coming into sort of digital and trying to bring their businesses to fast-forward, but on the other end of the spectrum are those that began digital transformations a decade or more ago and are on their second or third sort of leap forward.</p><p>That's still a major source and disruptions in industry help us. I think the other one, though, that you kind of alluded to is sort of the solving whole new sets of bigger problems, things you don't think of when you first think of a software partner. When we're dealing with a CEO these days, I got to figure out growth. I got to figure out a new route to market to fundamentally compete differently and that means -- that eventually involves the kind of a speed of a platform and the technology. So I think it is absolutely about the continuing momentum space for a lot of different industries across the board but also solving higher problems. I think those are both fueling the business growth we see day-in, day-out.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Okay.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Yes. I mean customer expectations are changing. I mean it's unbelievable when we start talking about delivering that kind of unique relevant, consistent experience across all channels. So when you look at marketing, sales, service, commerce, how do you deliver that? And Salesforce is doing that when you start talking about Customer 360 and when you add MuleSoft so you can do those integrations. I mean -- but it's really being driven by outcomes.</p><p>Everyone's talking about outcomes. What's the outcome that customer wants? And can you really deliver it to an individual, a segment of one which is a big challenge, I think, all of us face.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: And I'd build on that. So I think it's how you -- I mean how you get there. A lot of digital transformation has been maybe bailed under this idea of just -- we're just replatforming the business and how it operates.</p><p>So now what? Once you've done that \"transformation\" it's allowing you to look at enablement engines, like Salesforce, and say, \"Well, how do we start to empathize with the people who inherit that work in that platform?\" How do we start to change the conversation from the customer experience, the human experience and then, what does that perspective really unlock for us as business and allow us to do for the future of transforming businesses literally in the sense of transforming not just how we think about data or think about programmatic needs and addressing those needs but how we think about emotional needs? How do we think about behavioral needs of the business and the people that both drive that business and inherit that business? And I think that's part of the shift that we're seeing in this market, putting pressure on us to change the conversation and change how we're addressing those challenges to begin with.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Yes. So again, leveraging that as well. So we've always gone to market in 2 specific industries, financial service and healthcare. That's all we've ever done to think about what is the custom solution that we're providing? We don't actually start with the technology and the conversations with our clients. We start with, what are the changes that they need? What are the behaviors they're trying to impart? What are the outcomes that they're trying to find? What's been great about it is how much we've been able to do, how much more we've been able to do in that regard because of the nature of the Salesforce platform and what its tools have grown -- or how its tools have grown to help us do that.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. From the agency perspective, I can say agencies were historically not involved much on the B2B side of things. It was a lot of Salesforce's acquisitions, a lot more multicloud, lot bigger deals that we're seeing come through on it. We really look at Salesforce as the platform to be able to start to move people into the digital space on a B2C side. So we're just really happy with the growth and excited to see where it goes.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Great. And the guys, they set themselves alphabetically. Just thought...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible)</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Right, got it. So industry is something we've talked a lot about. And I appreciate Charlie's comment on leading specialization and major league soccer for the business. I think right now we've focused on 7 core industries. They represent 88% of our TAM over the next 5 years. A number of you go to market by industry, if not all of you, and talk to me a little bit about how our investment in industry products in the way that we're going to market is different and really have helped us align more closely. And Robert, why don't we start with you again?</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I mean industry is essential to our business. So our clients across 35 or 40 different industries want to understand we speak in their language, we understand the dynamics that are happening. We understand the disruptions that are happening. So it's no surprise in our partnership, we skew towards pushing for the idea of where can industry verticalization unlock new value, right? Because that's what really attracts the attention of the clients who are making -- trying to make a difference in their job every single day. And in many cases, functional solutions are fantastic, right? Charlie brought up some great examples and others that were on the Board -- Barry this morning talking about the idea of making these changes in their specific spaces that work with horizontal solutions. So that's fantastic and growing. But we see our major investments in vertical solutions together and that's going to be hugely important.</p><p>Take somebody like a Marriott who's dealing with a major disruption in their space. And Airbnb you saw they just launched a whole new business to try to expand their core business but also keep growing an ever more complex network of their owned properties, new brands that they've just acquired, et cetera. They're moving at a speed where we need -- the kind of vertical solutions that will make a difference in their space and be relevant in the rest of the industry. So we think verticals is a big play. And how Salesforce play into that? I think it's a unique model, insofar it's the more nimble model. It's got based -- having that as an advantage to be able to move quickly versus having to really think about changing the entire platform or extending the entire functional base is a great tool to really respond to that vertical need. So we see it as a big play together and that's where actually the most of our investments are together are these industry verticals that are fundamentally going to change individual spaces and that's the part that I think is exciting about what's coming. That's how we see it.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Great. Well, given the time, we'll jump to a few of you. So, Rich, why don't you add a couple.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Sure. I mean I would say specific to retail, pick an industry. With everything that's happening in retail and the disruption, it's unbelievable when we talk about customer experience. So I think with the acquisitions, when you look at acquisition of -- we'll go all the way back to ExactTarget but then add Demandware and then add CloudCraze for B2C, B2B to C, there's so much that's happening and it's so important because that's a different customer and the expectation is different.</p><p>So how you bring together, as I was saying, every channel has to be consistent. So someone calls a call center versus someone goes online versus someone with a bot versus mobile, how do you provide that consistent experience? So the solutions and I think we've worked very closely with Salesforce how do you develop those solutions to bring together that experience and create a consistent experience, and it's been very important. So I think the full-force solutions is an example. When you talk about unified commerce for grocery or some of the different solutions that come to market because it is a different need when you start talking about some of these specific verticals.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. Gireesh, let's jump down to you.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Yes. Sure. So you have to be able -- in our experience, if we're not talking in the language of the customer that we're trying to stand in front of, we're not resonating and the messages are getting through. And they are unable to sort of see how they can realize the value of that. And so I'll stay away from generalizing about clients and services considering the room, but let's say healthcare. So you've got CEO of a hospital system. I mean he or she is an MD maybe and hasn't thought about technology ever maybe, and is thinking about, \"Well, I need to include or increase quality of care measures for my physicians, who are thinking about regulatory changes.\" Technology is the last thing on their mind. We need to talk to them about in the language that they're thinking about and how they're going to be helping their business. And Salesforce's ability to sort of dive into that and double down on that industry verticalization and industry specialization has only helped us in our conversations. I mean when you think about the fact that we can now go to market with Health Cloud as a foundation. And that being a great sort of baseline instead of functionality and features with which to build from and it's also someone holistic across the health industry. It just then allows us to get to value faster and get to those types of business outcomes for those types of customers in a better way.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Maybe just to add one point. It's probably not an either/or. I mean this is an interesting thing as we're seeing whether it's a Velocity or an nCino, some of these kinds of extensions that have very different flavors. It isn't just A or B that are driving major changes in the individual industries. It's also a unique aspect of how you go to market. So plays up to a lot of what we just described.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Got it. Josh, why don't you talk a little about B2C and retail and what you're seeing from that industry perspective?</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. Absolutely. Yes, I think one of the things that's being really exciting for us is seeing Salesforce start to really verticalize on it. We work very closely with the retail team. For us, they're allowed to sell all different clouds in it. So that's a big benefit for us. As we work with a lot of our customers, they're really looking to completely replatform their entire experience, leverage not only the customer data that they've got but then how do they fully access that across whatever channels as well as multisite, multi-region, et cetera, and then tie that into the agency experience as well. And when I look -- and I'll bring it up, look, in the agency world, you've got Adobe and Salesforce has now started to push into that. From our perspective, we look at it, and the biggest thing that Salesforce has that no one else has in the market is first-party data. And you look at what historically Salesforce has been and you start to add on the B2C aspect of it, we don't believe there's another player out there in the market that can really be as powerful as Salesforce. So that's why we're excited, that's why you're seeing a lot more agency interest now in Salesforce and we expect that to continue to grow. And of the 250,000 new consultants on it, I know we're going to be adding a lot more to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. I know, right? And I think one of the things that we've got is there is a dearth of talent out there. So everyone here on the panel, we are all staffing up to do this because we see a massive growth opportunity whether it be the B2B2C, the B2C aspect of it, and we're just really excited about Salesforce.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Nelson, let me give you a bit of a platform here. Talk to me a little bit about how sort of the age where machine and humans are much closer together. How are we delivering compelling insights to our customer? And what do you think is key for us to think about as we sort of embark on this new frontier?</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: It's interesting. I saw -- I think era was on a slide and then it was mentioned again. I think this idea of eras and these eras that we're in, my view is we've gone from an era, largely in part, in last 50 years where we as individuals have catered to the limitations of technology and worked around them and found ways to adjust and adapt. And now we're just getting a taste for what it means to be in an era where technology is catering to us as individuals.</p><p>And that's pretty profound because it's again changing the conversation about what we're doing and what we're doing with it. In a lot of ways it's going back to the sort of 100-plus-year-old idea of a one-to-one idea, I think, you mentioned this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: But doing it in a way that's -- doing it at scale. I can't do one-to-one and 1 to then 10 million people without the sort of channels and power and data and all the stuff behind it that modern technology is driving for us.</p><p>So this era that we're going from a technology-immersed world where we're now having conversations about what then it means for us, it's pretty profound. And what it means for us is really the focus on me, what I need and my experience. And this idea of being in this human world and we're seeing headlines from major companies or system integrators and all sorts of stuff that are saying, \"Oh, we're actually in the human business.\" That's a pretty profound shift on how sort of we're looking at business challenges and how we're working with our clients to get through their challenges and sort of lift them out of the silos or some of the client's mission is, really the customers mention this, lifting them out of the silos of how they're solving problems to solve it sort of around again in an outcome base -- sort of becoming the hot word of this panel. The outcome-based view of what it means to drive change across the entire enterprise but again, the benefit is not to the enterprise itself, it's to people who consume that enterprise. And I think that's a profound shift.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Absolutely. I think we talked a little bit about the human element here and we talked about talent being critical and most of you heard speak earlier about Trailhead.</p><p>Really an amazing enabler platform that Salesforce has put to market. And many of you were working closely with us in terms of taking that platform out into the market to help develop that next generation of talent. Some of you have taken it in-house. So I think I'd love to take a minute and let's start with Gireesh and talk a little bit about how Silverline has taken My Trailhead.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Sure. We're huge fans. We love it. So we were lucky enough to sort of participate in the beta program for My Trailhead. And we've taken it on internally at Silverline to help really change the way that we're enabling not only our salesforce, developers and consultants and associates that are on the projects with our customers but our team internally. We started with a new hire orientation sort of a paradigm. So we have a Trailmix for folks that they get access to the minute they sign the documents to become part of the Silverline. And they can immediately start going through the Trailhead into the trails and figuring out what and who Silverline is. What that has done is it has changed the way that we think about the orientation of a new employee. So instead of thinking about and taking time to give them the road materials and sort of here's the slideware, they've already done all that. We can focus much more on the community building and the relationship building of the new team members so they can sort of become a better part of the organization faster. We've got -- we're -- it's a huge part of our learning and development aspect across the board, which is obviously a very important thing in a consulting or financial services company like ours. But industry training in terms of getting folks up and running on our subvertical and really across the board, as we've continued to spin up new areas of our business technologically, we're using Trailhead as well on that running platform.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. Robert, you want to mention?</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Well, I mean -- we're a pretty big fan. I mean let's put this in real terms. We've got 16,500 people who are skilled in sales force. We're going to hire another 4,000 this year alone. I mean the relevance of one of us to our clients is how current you are, especially in the age of acquisitions and really understanding the direction of where it's heading at the intersection of the industry and maybe the functional problem you're trying to solve, keeping all of those planned at the line is harder than you think. And when it comes down to the ability of a platform like My Trailhead to sort of democratize content, it allows us to create these Trailmixes that say, \"Hey, I've done 4 or 5 sales force implementations.\" But guess what? Now MuleSoft is in the mix and that's going to fundamentally change the API connections and open a window to a whole new set of data and challenges. We've got to have folks around our paths that can suddenly say, \"I know how to put the 8 or 9 things that are most critical to know to be at my best and be able to make those happen in very real terms.\" That can't be done at headquarters in central-central, right? With smart people who are reaching out to the edge and then sort of thinking about how to put it in the center, and then get it out to people. Our credibility comes one person to another who's played a role previously and going to the next. So we're excited about just because the sheer scale gives us an opportunity.</p><p>So it's nice to be a part of some of the early days with it. I mean we're at 50,000-batches-plus already, and I expect we'll probably going to double that this coming year. So anyway, it really does change the game for us to be relevant to our client and current as they're expecting. And that's probably a fair expectation of us, right? We're being paid to bring insights and that's a big game. So, yes.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. So let's talk a little bit. You mentioned acquisitions, we've made some interesting announcements in the last few months.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Was there another one this morning? I didn't look.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Over the last few years. But it's been great because the acquisitions you guys have already established practices around. You are invested heavily. This is a fabulous way for us to continue to grow and serve our clients together. Why don't we start with you, Nelson, and talk a little bit about maybe your thoughts on our recent acquisitions?</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: I mean the one that -- most recent comes to mind is Tableau. Once again, I missed a few in the last couple days.</p><p>Tableau from our perspective is fantastic. I mean we love it. We love it for a lot of reasons. It's industry-standard. It's smart. It makes a lot of sense in terms of the relationship and the natural fit already for us as a consultancy and for myself selfishly as I think about what it means to enable our capabilities with the intersection of design, it's because Tableau's acquisition has changed the relationship we have with a broader set of buyers. So particularly to Salesforce, when we're talking to one part of the organization and one part of the enterprise, now with Tableau, we're talking to you multiple different parts of the enterprise. We're talking to strategy and analytics. We're talking to you folks that traditionally maybe we wouldn't have gone to with just a pure-play Salesforce message.</p><p>And that for us is fantastic. Because, again, we're thinking about how do we get access to transforming and bringing platforms that unlock a lot of potential within the business, not just one part of the business, and Tableau just is one of the many examples of adding to that story.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. Rich, I know you're a MuleSoft top partner. Why don't you talk a little bit about how that acquisition has been in terms of the growth of our joint partnership?</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Absolutely. So by bringing in MuleSoft, I mean you're really starting to enable that Customer 360. Because obviously, it's kind of the nirvana. Everyone wants it. Everyone talks about it. We've been talking about it for years. It's not a new concept. You kind of have a single view of a customer. But the data part of that is very complicated.</p><p>So how do you have a platform that can bring that data together across marketing, sales, service, commerce, bring it together, so you do really start to think about, I can't have one view of the customer. If someone calls me, I get to see the orders they place in the call center. I don't have to get into another system. I get to see the e-mails that were sent to them so I know what offers because otherwise, the customer is going to leave. You don't get a lot of chances anymore with our new breed of millennials and younger because the expectations are so high. You should know who I am. So I think the MuleSoft really gave it the knitting that brought some of the already-powerful tools together but then knitted together really from a data perspective I thought was very, very important.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. So would you like to comment?</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. I think from my perspective, as we start to kind of look at the acquisitions that happened on it, it really started to transform Salesforce from a B2B to B2C aspect on it. Everything started as an ExactTarget partner, and so it's been very interesting as the ExactTarget acquisition happened and then all the ones that have followed since then.</p><p>We also believe that Customer 360 piece and really gained that full view of the customer as part of it. We love MuleSoft. We also love Heroku, which I think is an underappreciated acquisition that Salesforce did. And I think for a lot of people, if you don't understand Heroku and how that can really tie into the larger one, that's how we look at really integrating all of those customers together on it. So we're as excited, we are interested to see what does Salesforce want to acquire in the future as well, and it's going to be a fun ride but it's never dull.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Got it. Nelson, talk to me a little bit about culture. I'm going to pivot a little here. I think in terms of how culture and core values have played into our partnership and how you approach your customers, especially when you're thinking about that human element.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: Yes. How much time do we have? This is a big topic. I think we all know, I'm fascinated and encouraged that language of Silicon Valley is using that as a bellwether, has changed, in part, in the last several years from language of ideation, disruption, innovation to language of purpose, ethics, responsibility. It's a big shift for large giant tech companies that are driving our economy.</p><p>And the impact is felt everywhere. I think there's probably not a single person here that works for a company that isn't having some conversation about quality, some conversation about inclusion and diversity, some conversation about purpose-driven business and what it means to align the values of us as individuals and what we walk into on our daily lives with what our companies are doing to sort of hold up a better standard for all of us.</p><p>And that's important. It's probably why we engaged with you all, Salesforce, on the Pathfinder program a couple of years ago, I think just a couple of years ago, in helping to take a nontraditional workforce and train them up and get them to learn new skills and get them into the workplace, literally aligning not just their ability to learn and develop new skills but aligning a lot of what we're seeing with quality and diversity and making that real and tangible and actionable in the market, and that's really important. It's a lot better than certainly like the 10 years ago where we all just virtual signaled and say, \"Hey, there's an important call, let's change our Twitter icon and feel good about it.\" And now we're saying, let's really work together as businesses to make real impactful, insightful change.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: If I could just jump in. I mean I love how it's happening the other way around as well. Like we're actually having customers now ask us in our first introduction decks, tell us about your value. Tell us about how you approach your employee. Tell us about how you approach your customers. Show us what that means for your company. So that's a decision point that we're making as an organization to choose a partner that we're going to work with.</p><p>I mean we actually -- Silverline is actually now putting some of our DIBs, or diversity, inclusion and belonging, as -- in our approach deck, sort of to say, \"Hey, this is who we are as an organization. Do you want to work with us? Because this is the way we want to do the market.\"</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: And we see it -- we see it in the core messaging of Salesforce. We see it in the core messaging of ourselves and others here on the panel. I think it's not -- it's no longer nice to have. People, we are literally making choices in the partnerships that we make based on the values and culture of those companies. We know our talent is making choices in joining us because the value and culture of us. And ultimately, customers -- we have customers, and we walk out of this room, will go make choices depending upon the culture and values of the companies that we're giving our money to. So it's all converging into one space. I think that's a great point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: And I think, for us, we've got a new program at Wunderman Thompson for good that is specifically looking at how do we do good in the larger ecosystem. And one of the things we love about Salesforce is that whole 1-1-1 philosophy on it. And I know for a lot of our senior leadership on it when they saw some of the things that Salesforce have been doing on it, they were definitely impressed by it, and we just won a bunch of Canon awards for some of our inclusion [worth doing ton] as well. So our newest one up at the Plugout, Tommy Adaptive, if you guys haven't heard about it, look it up. It's some great stuff that we've been working on it. So excited to do it. And we think it's huge for our talent. I mean finding talent in this industry is tough, retaining them is tough. But when you can do good things for good people on it, it makes it a lot easier to continue to keep good people.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: And lost in this is the fact that it's actually helping projects succeed and sustain themselves, right?</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Absolutely.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: I mean if you looked at the history of potholes in transformational stories, right? The case studies that are out there, the human aspect. The focus on execution is the stuff that falls off. If you start to really plan your program around something that has that higher purpose, it engages individuals in wanting ownership. It's ultimately going to help this next wave of transformation, whatever word that means, to actually stick. And so that focus has certainly added, put a little bit more responsibility and onus on the companies. It's more than just putting the technology and the process and tools and all that good stuff. It really is, I think, galvanizing the people side of it. So I think it bodes well for the future of projects with far fewer falling short.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: All right. So our last question before we open it up to the audience. Why don't we talk a little bit about what you guys are most excited about for the future with us together? And Rich, why don't we start with you?</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: I think with -- as we're talking about delivering -- I'm very passionate about customer experience, right? So I think delivering that outcome to a customer like that's got me most excited because it's not a technology to your point. We're not talking -- we're not selling technology anymore. We're selling a solution and we're selling an outcome, which is very exciting. So I think the conversations have shift. They include culture. They include values. But we're really talking about -- I mean, digital transformation is so overused but we are talking about with customers those exciting conversations. No one is coming to say, \"I want to implement CRM.\"</p><p>Someone's coming to implement something that's going to change the way they interact with their customers. And I think those conversations to me are the super exciting ones. I mean you're sitting belly to belly with the CEO and talking about how are you going to transform your relationship with your customer. And I think that's the exciting part.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Okay, Nelson?</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: I'm excited that we're having this conversation. Honestly, I was joking about one of my colleagues a little before this, we would not be here maybe 5 years ago. A head of design at an ad agency, like what are we doing here? And I think what we're doing here is a reflection of what the future is today. We're making huge investments in commerce, customer, marketing. We're making giant investments in assets and new revenue streams based on the Salesforce Platform. We're making huge investments in the data, the analytics, all the buzzwords, machine learning, AI, et cetera, that supports all of that. But we're doing it in the pursuit of no longer chasing transformation of the business but chasing the transformation of the individual because of what Salesforce is allowing us to do.</p><p>And again, having these conversations at the intersection of technology and design and creative arts is changing the solutions that we drive and ultimately, benefiting hopefully a new generation of consumers for what this means for them in their daily lives.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Okay. Gireesh?</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: I mean I'm just excited about the opportunity. It's so exciting to see where the growth is happening and how much of it is ahead of us. I mean Silverline was born in Salesforce's cloud. That's all we've never known and we're still a pure-play implementation shop that focuses on the full life cycle of that but within this ecosystem. And with the M&amp;A, we talk about the acquisitions and things like that, as more and more of those happen, it just provides a greater runway and a greater ability for us to provide holistic services to our customers and the services that help their businesses grow in the right way. So I mean I'm excited about it. And it's just -- it's compelling to see how now we can start to close the loop on the whole transformation idea instead of just putting in some technology in the front. And we now got the things that knit the pieces together and be ready for the future with MuleSoft. We've got -- we can show ourselves how it's working with Tableau and sort of then we have it run back again and sort of continue to see that engine.</p><p>So I'm just excited about the growth that I get to be a part of the -- as part of the ecosystem.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. Josh?</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. I'm more kind of a data geek on -- for my day-to-day on it. What excites me about it is that I can literally take an agency-style business, platform it onto Salesforce and power big agency creative ideas. And things that I never thought that we'd be doing even 5 years ago.</p><p>My personal goal here and one of the things that we're going to try to make happen for next year is to win a Cannes Lion using Salesforce technology. Think about it. I mean that's kind of a crazy statement that 3 years ago it would have never been possible. So look, I just -- I love the ride, I love doing it, I love the breadth of Salesforce. I'm excited to see how far we can push it.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Fabulous. Robert, wrap it up with you.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: I'm pretty fired up about the change that's in front of us around sort of rethinking marketing and sales. The entire ecosystem is really being challenged, right? We talked about customers being more educated when they begin the engagement process with companies. And very few have done a nice job really kind of readying themselves for that rotation into a very different model and clinging to kind of an old siloed world of traditional marketing. I'll tell you this, we are finding that the folks who have the hardest time to break are the ones who are at the top execution in individual functions.</p><p>The best marketing organizations in the world are having a hard time reaching across the aisle to say to sales, \"Wait a minute, how do we actually start to get this data flowing and pick up where a customer is as opposed to where we want them to be?\" And so the idea of those that are going to break through are really going to actually I think skyrocket forward. So the stories we're going to be reading about in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months are already being written.</p><p>But I think that's the stuff that's on the horizon that's going to be just -- is really going to fundamentally change markets. So that's exciting to be a part of and this is a key part of it. So -- and our relationship will end up being the basis of a lot of those changes. So that's what keeps our people kind of motivated every day.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Well, I'm grateful for all of you for being here. And we'd like to open it up to the audience. You guys have some questions. Brent?</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: I'll start it off here, breaking the ice. I have 2 questions, if I could, maybe for Robert or Rich. We heard Deluxe talk about kind of going wall-to-wall, multi-cloud. Could you just compare and contrast the type of engagements in the pipeline today versus a year ago? Is there a big shift in towards multi-cloud? Or is it still just a handful, these are anomalies and maybe that's still on the come?</p><p>One. And then 2 for Josh. You mentioned something a little bit about kind of Salesforce, Adobe, and the agency world. And I was just wondering if you could drill down a little bit more on what's Adobe missing? And why are you so bullish around Salesforce? And why is it differentiated? So 2 questions if I could.</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: I think if I were to look at our pipeline today versus before, I would say, actually, the problems that people are trying to solve, especially in a fast-moving industry, think financial services, think consumer goods, think, again, retail banking specifically, for example. It's not so much that they want to buy multi-cloud, it's that they want to solve a problem that requires you to take multiple pieces and MuleSoft and some of these other acquisitions to pull it off.</p><p>So I would say very much if you are looking at it -- if you turn the telescope around, you're starting to see more and more problems that I need to select multiple pieces of Salesforce to solve and that's what we're probably being asked for or our teams are coming up with and reaching out to Salesforce to say, \"Hey, we want to do something pretty groundbreaking with.\" You saw what Coca-Cola is doing to rethink their field service footprint in an age where machines don't -- you don't just need to understand refrigeration and coin slots, you got to think about wireless and you got to think about Bluetooth and you got to think about intelligence baked in, in social media connections. That requires you to think multi-cloud.</p><p>That is becoming more and more and more of our solution as mobile needs connected devices, needs rethinking, selling and servicing in whatever industry you're in. So we absolutely see a spike in that but it's probably more from the fact that the problems you're trying to solve are necessarily what someone's asking for in terms of a slip.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: Couldn't agree more. Couldn't agree more. Yes, it's absolutely -- the solutions are more complicated because they are cross channeled. So because of that, I would say almost every deal is cross thought.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Okay. Thanks. Josh?</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. I think -- look, Adobe has been a lot more on kind of a customer experience layer, a lot more AEM on it. I think Salesforce historically has been a lot more B2B. It's originally SFA and kind of everything that started with that. So I think there was a divergence just from a thought leadership perspective of, if you're an agency, would you ever work with Salesforce? And I could confidently say, 10 years ago, the answer probably would have been no.</p><p>I think what started to happen is that as Salesforce has completely diversified its portfolio in terms of offerings, there's definitely overlap. But Adobe does not have a database offering, really. There is no CRM part of it. And when we look at our customers on it, you can talk about third-party data, which is great that you can go out and do sort of the DMP and you can talk about second-party data. But what's really gold for people is that first-party data and making sure you've got a relationship with the customer. Adobe has absolutely no answer to that. And when we look at customers really trying to unify and make sure they've got a platform decision that will work wherever they want to be on it, Salesforce is the only winner on it. So as I look at this, I think you're going to start to see a lot more agencies getting involved with Salesforce. I think Adobe's got an interesting marketplace right now. Do I think they're going to stay there? Probably not. And we're very, very bullish on Salesforce.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: One connection point you didn't ask but I think is implied is we're actually more reaching out to companies together. I mean we're partnering, for example, with Salesforce to go to a client and say, \"We know you have this problem. This is how we can go unlock the value. And the question is if you have another item that will generate $300 million of EBITDA laying around, that's fine. But that's probably also making a shift towards what you said whether it's in the marketing space and the agency space where we can see an opportunity and are actually going to a client and bringing that idea as opposed to simply sort of fielding the item. So that might be fueling a little of a shift as we're just discussing.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Anyone else? Nikolay? Okay.</p><p>NIKOLAY IVANOV BELIOV, VP, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I'm wondering when you have a problem you're trying to solve for a customer, at what point is a more out-of-the-box solution, like CRM, too limiting? And you might need to go with a custom, call it that custom solution, like Pegasystems? And is that point changing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's a good question.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: I would say, you guys can take it...</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: Yes. Could you just say it one more time to make sure I get it?</p><p>NIKOLAY IVANOV BELIOV: So I guess when I think about software, there's like a spectrum from totally out-of-the-box, implement it, use the processes and the workflow that CRM's created -- Salesforce created versus creating a custom-type Salesforce or CRM system that might cater to what the client is already doing. And so I'm wondering where is that point today where you say well, actually, maybe we should do some stuff custom here. And is that shifting with the evolution of CRM?</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: So I'll jump in and certainly, ask my colleagues here to help. But -- I mean the concept of custom in the Salesforce Platform world is very fuzzy, right? It's very -- it's changing every once every day. And then things that you can do that we can do on the platform without touching a lick of code is -- are getting, becoming exponentially more literally every release. And so the times that we have -- that we are now today saying and dropping down into, let's call it, code or what we would call custom, is much more limited than it ever used to be. And it's usually when you're talking about things like Heroku that is a really hard-core interactive data processing, it isn't workflow or I think systems engagement sort of base. And so to sort of the PEGA tangent there as an example. I mean -- actually to Josh's point, when the platform becomes the conversation, it all stops, right? All the other sort of point solutions or sort of specific industry vendors kind of fall off the minute you start talking about how can you layer in Marketing Cloud or needing to bring in more systems or create a service API with MuleSoft. The minute you have a conversation around the word platform, everything else kind of falls away and you've got what you need within the Salesforce ecosystem.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: And the only thing I'd add to that is if a customer comes in and the first solution is a custom solution, I think you're kind of losing the whole reason of why you look at Salesforce.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's a great point.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: And so -- and I think one of the powers of Salesforce is that you can really platform, do almost everything you need on it. I mean when we look at Heroku, we do it for some really intense data processing or if we're doing something totally crazy, kind of tip of the spear stuff on it. But that's kind of one-off crazy ideas that we're trying to push. We love it to platform on. We want to standardize on it, and that's why people want to partner with Salesforce.</p><p>And when I look at other kind of point solutions or specific vertical solutions, especially some of the higher ad space on it. I mean you've got a whole bunch of stuff that's got very, very narrow focuses and then you have to customize a lot on it. Salesforce is a much bigger horizontal. And I think somebody will look at that and say, \"Hey, that's a negative.\" We look at it because it's a really sick horizontal play, which allows you not to have to customize a lot per se on that actual platform but you can really customize for that specific customer on it without doing anything that's actually custom, per se.</p><p>GIREESH SONNAD;SILVERLINE;CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: And there's a difference between at least the way we use it between configuration and customer, right? It's a very important difference.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Yes. I would agree with that. I was going to make that exact point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Exactly.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Because I think someone was talking custom, sometimes it's an education. Because there's so much configuration you can do and you get focus -- sometimes the customers will get too focused on pixels and perfection and you can do that but it's configuration, it's not customization. So I think Salesforce -- some of the education is to know that you can do all this within configuration; you don't have to touch codes. If you have to, of course, maybe there's 10% or something that you have to do. But if you can get 80% or 90% of the way through configuration, I think, the conversation is over.</p><p>ROBERT WOLLAN;ACCENTURE;GLOBAL MANAGING DIRECTOR: And maybe this is the point where there's never been a more important time to have a fairly strong partner ecosystem, right? I mean, there's never been more important...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible)</p><p>RICHARD LYONS;LYONS CONSULTING GROUP;CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: And not to be self-serving, it doesn't matter who you pick. But I think there's never been -- because I tell people all the time, don't fall in love with cool, fall in love with money. Because ultimately, it cast aside the 1 million decisions you could make that intuitively sound good but you can't see a path to that -- of that value point. So I think the point is about Salesforce having a really strong robust partner ecosystem makes it a lot easier for the clients to feel like they're making good decisions that move fast and are as lean as possible while still getting to the outcome.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That's the point.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Very much so. I think we're at time. Can we take one more? All right, we'll take one more question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So I was just wondering in terms of the Customer 360, there seems like -- at least to me, I haven't figured it out, 2 potential things going on. The first, we're hearing a lot about stuff like Redshift, Snowflake, a lot of these cloud databases and doing a lot of analysis and mixing of data in those but then you have the MuleSoft and kind of these APIs and pulling in data into Salesforce. So are these 2 different tangents, does one win over the other or are they very complementary? just would love to hear your thoughts.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: Yes. I mean I've got very different. So Customer 360 is literally just Salesforce identity unification within Salesforce and that's all that it does on it. When you look at database products and the rest of that and kind of what that's used for, it's a fundamentally different kind of need on it. And again, the Salesforce kind of flavor of that with the Heroku, again slightly different. It's PostgreS versus Snowflake and some of the other ones. So I -- look, I don't want to go too much into it but if it's a conversation you want afterwards, more than happy to kind of talk about where that is. But Customer 360 is literally just identity unification across the clouds on it. It does nothing more than that.</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: Which is not to minimize the importance of that at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Very, very...</p><p>JOSH PIERRY;PIERRY INC.;CEO: No, no, but that's enough complexity in of itself to a business outcome as they were talking about at Deluxe this morning, but then your complexity wheel starts getting much wider.</p><p>NELSON KUNKEL;DELOITTE DIGITAL; CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER: And I think what it's highlighting, too, is how complex this ecosystem is. I mean we all hear -- I think we all know it. I've spent a lot of time looking at databases and the differences on it. I can tell you the average customer, when they start to hear some of this stuff, has no idea what the difference is on it. But one thing that I've loved about Salesforce is it always moves in the right direction with it. So that directionally it's always been great for customers even if it is complex for most people to understand. But again, it kind of comes back to this great horizontal play. It's a configuration, not a customization issue.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: Great. This team will be at lunch with the exception of Robert. I think he has to leave us for his flight. But you can absolutely pick their brains over lunch. Thank you so much for having us up here. And I think -- are we going to take a quick break or transition straightaway?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: 15 minutes.</p><p>KORI O'BRIEN: 15 minutes and we'll bring our next set of customers up. Thank you. Thank you, guys.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Okay. So I hope you found this morning productive so far. We have one more panel to go. And I thought I would talk a little bit about trying to orient us towards some suggestions of things that we might talk about here. So I'm just going to go through and ask each person to introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their business, kind of the same format that we used before. And then I'll try to pick some different areas to explore about the business than the ones that we've already covered. So maybe with no further ado, Karen, let's start at this end with you, who kindly joined us from the U.K. Maybe you could talk a little bit about St. James. I'm not sure everybody knows who.</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: Yes. Happy to do that. So I'm Karen Stevens. I work for St. James's Place Wealth Management. We are a wealth management company in the U.K., established in 1991. We are FTSE 100. We are listed with a market cap of around $5 billion. We were the second fastest company from startup to enter the FTSE 100, and we now have around GBP 100 billion of funds under management for our clients. We have nearly 370,000 clients with a 96% retention rate. And we have almost 4,000 advisers in the U.K, which represent roughly 11% to 12% of the U.K. market. And so fairly significant presence in the U.K. And I've been with SJP for 20 years and with no background in technology whatsoever. I am a financial adviser. And I moved across to the technology area 4 years ago absolutely in that representing our advisers and our clients to make sure we were going to offer a digital solution that enhances our safe-to-safe offering. And we have deliberately kept our Salesforce program as well as technology team and we're running it from a business area.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: So I thought this was an entirely new area for us to explore. What can business do not without the technology team, but independently of, and drive the business at the pace of that. So I thought this was a very innovative approach to how to, quite frankly, address your jobs in a way as investors, and I thought that would be a great place for us to explore going forward. Matt?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: Everybody, I'm Matt Gove, I'm the Chief Consumer Officer at Piedmont Healthcare. We are the largest health system in Georgia. We're about 11 hospitals, about 550 front doors as we like to call them, locations around the states. We're $4 billion in revenue, 23,000, 24,000 employees, and physician network of about 2,400 physicians. I have been with Piedmont for 7 -- good grief, almost 8 years to the -- twice as long as I've ever worked anywhere. I am responsible -- functionally, the executive responsible for marketing communications, patient experience, government relations and community outreach.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Awesome.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: I'm Mike Onders, and I'm with KeyBanc, one of the hosts -- cohost. Brent didn't say, but KeyBanc's a 195-year-old regional bank, with $135 billion in assets, about 20,000 employees, 3 million customers in a very strange footprint that goes from Alaska to Maine, with some gaps in the middle of the U.S., on the northern side of the U.S., about 1,200 branches in that range. And I wear 3 hats at KeyBanc. One is the Chief Data Officer. One is -- I oversee our architecture team and our tech strategy team, so that puts me in lot -- in almost any project the bank is working in. And I'm a divisional CIO for kind of shared business functions like HR, finance risk and marketing, which are heavy users of the data space.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Super. So maybe, Karen, back to you. So I think your business model of driving -- of being a financial adviser and then coming over to run something as, well, we heard it can be complex, it could be -- have challenges around adoption, changing the way people work. Can you give us a little bit of what's worked for you? And quite frankly, maybe some things that haven't? Some advice?</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: Okay. So we started our Salesforce program really in January 2018. We had a small footprint. We had some small areas of business using it before, but really took off in January 2018. And initially, our program was very much sensitive around Salesforce as a solution to manage our adviser population, so definitely B2B. Decided to go with financial services cap because we knew at some point we would then want to deploy into the hands of our advisers. We wanted to really understand the project and the functionality. Through our learning, make a lot of mistakes in-house, where it was nice and safe before we put it in the hand of our advisers. We cannot afford to disrupt our adviser population.</p><p>I think somebody said earlier, it was very quick to deploy. So we signed on the dotted line, 31st of January. We made Salesforce wait right to the last minute, 31st of January that contract was signed. And we did our first deployment in June. It really was that quick. Now we are not a big tech company. We don't have great data models, We don't have all the functionality available, but we managed to achieve something really quite quickly. And then we used that first deployment as a template to roll out to other areas of the business. We now have -- we're probably halfway through using our licenses that we bought. By the end of this year, we will have 1,500 employees using Salesforce. We very quickly decided that wasn't enough. We're quite an entrepreneurial company and we decided to go faster and quicker than we'd anticipated. So we also now have 2 side streams of work going on. 2 proof of concepts. One in Singapore. So we actually have a small footprint in Asia. We have around 100 advisers out there. We have a population of advisers in Singapore. And the client experience -- client expectations in Singapore is very different to the U.K. They expect their digital offering. They expect something in the hands and that they can use and play with. So actually, we're working on a program of work at the moment to pilot the complete electronic onboarding for our clients in Singapore. So we also have a corporate program for managing advisers, they'll have a Singapore program for electronic cloud onboarding and we also have, in parallel, just started a piece of work to actually work out what a template would be for putting this product in the hands of our advisers. So we've taken one of our largest businesses. And I said we have 4,000 advisers. We have them split across 2,500 business. So we have anything from 1-man bands to sought advisers within a practice. So we've taken our largest and we've done a discovery with them of 3 months. And Matt said, actually what could this tool look like in the hands of our advisers completely end-to-end. And we started that program and we will have our first delivery of that work stream in September. So we've done quite a lot quite quickly and in parallel, and precise to what we said we wouldn't do.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great. And are all your advisers employed by you?</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: None of them are employed. None of them are employed. They all run their own businesses, but they are appointed representatives of SJP. So they can only recommend the products and services provided by us. We are a virtually integrated company, so we have an adviser on and we have -- we manufacture our own products as well.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great. Super. And Matt, how about yourself?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: How about...</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: What has your journey been like?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: Oh, goodness. So I don't have to tell anybody in the room who's interacted with a healthcare system how awful it can be in terms of customer experience and even the Piedmont hold itself out as cream of the crop in Georgia. I don't know that we were any different. So we started -- before we engaged with Salesforce, we started on our own internal journey of understanding how and how we were going to go about building a differentiated experience. And one of the things we knew in building that differentiated experience for our customers, was that we didn't have the platform to better understand them and help guide them through their health care journey with Piedmont. And the funny thing about that is, is that we have more information about our customers than practically any business does, right? Because we have -- and we can't use it in all the same way that you might use it in your own business, but it can -- it does help build a pretty complete picture when you put it together. And so fast forward a little bit, that was in '15. In '16, we started engaging with Salesforce on how to get started and how to -- and to start building. And knew pretty quickly that looking at the other vertical CRM products and health care, they're really just campaign builders, they don't really get into true relationship management, and to be perfectly frank, I hope none of you work or like any of them, but most of them are garbage. And so -- and I won't name names, you can find me afterwards. And so we actually had to ask Salesforce. Initially, they presented with us with a health care partner and we had to ask to come in separately, can we just work with you guys. In doing that, we started identifying places in the organization. So it's marketing. Of course, Marketing Cloud is one of the first places. I was just talking to [Jaurice] about that bit. Marketing is one of the first places we implemented and that's true with a lot of health systems these days that are looking at Salesforce as going in through the marketing side because our marketing functions, generally speaking, are pretty primitive and in need -- dire need of updating. But then also using sales team management tools really quickly as well through our physician outreach team and the focus you go from doctor to doctor, ensuring they know about Piedmont's services. We're in the process right now of trying to roll it out in our call center. Much to my friend Jeff's chagrin, it takes a long time for these things to work their way through our system, and though we've got -- what we've been able to do is to build an appreciation for what the platform can do amongst a large set of middle- to upper-level executives, and by doing that, have set it up to be -- the way I like to view it at least is we have 3 major platforms and they're not all SaaS, obviously, but you've got EPIC as our electronic health record. We've got Oracle, PeopleSoft as our ERP and then we're going to have Salesforce as our engagement layer across the entire organization. I mean so consolidating as much of that in one place as possible is, is really helpful. And I should mention really quickly, we are a heavy Tableau user, so we saw that news with happiness.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Good. Well, thank you. And how about at KeyBanc? We had quite an update last year, Lesa participated with us -- Evans, and gave us an idea about what was going on. Can you give us kind of a bit of an update and...</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Sure. So KeyBanc has been on a 5-year journey with Salesforce. We started in 2014. We're a full service bank, so corporate bank, small business, retail. Started in the corporate bank with Lesa Evans. We now have it rolled out across 10 lines of businesses, probably about close to 4,000 seats. We started with Sales Cloud. We have -- we started out with Exact Markets or we're in Marketing Cloud. And then by the time we got to the wealth business, Financial Services Cloud was available, so we're Financial Services Cloud. We have Wealth and Financial Services Cloud and Corporate and Sales Cloud and at some point those 2 will come together. We were heavy early kind of analytics users of Wave and then Einstein Analytics. But we're also a heavy Tableau users shop. So we've rolled out Tableau for the last 2 years and probably have 3,000 people using Tableau across the bank. And we have, even before the acquisition, integrated Tableau with Salesforce and we can talk later about the data reasons we did that and some of the reasons we were able to do that. But we are on a data journey for about 6 or 7 years. Modernizing our data supply chain and putting Hadoop and data lake and data marts and that puts the data into Salesforce, but we also pull out the data out of Salesforce and put it in our data lake for more analytics. So work side, we caught, kind of now the journey we're on now, I'd say, we've got it rolled out. We have pretty good adoption of Salesforce, but it's viewed as a executive management oversight tool, right? This is for management to see what's going on and we're trying to spin that now and using analytics and Einstein to say how do we make those tool a productive tool for the sales team, so that they feel it's helping them make their job easier and not -- they're doing everything, so that executives know what we're doing. So a lot of the early analytics were dashboards on the pipelines and activities and seeing where the sales flow was. And we're trying to spin that now and say how do we give the salesperson the tools and the advice and the recommendation to say, this is how you're going to close your deals, this is where you should spend your time. And I know Salesforce is focused on that. And I think integrating Tableau into that with Einstein Discovery and some of the prediction stuff, that's the next phase of our journey now.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: That's great. Super. So all 3 of you mentioned a couple of things like Financial Services Cloud or Health Cloud. And I think there might be some questions in the room or some kind of keying off the configuration versus the custom. What's your view on, first of all, is it useful? And what do you consider to be the difference between the totally horizontal platform and then Financial Services Cloud? And then -- or Health? And then the second part is, how would you score that in terms of maturity and capability and what would you like to see next on those? So maybe we can just take a little bit of feedback on those and the strategy.</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: Okay. I have no technology background. When I moved across to this area, I was working with our technology guys, I asked them to draw me a map of what we have today, and what we do, how do we do it. Oh my, it looked like a plate of spaghetti, it's horrible. And we expect our advisers to be efficient and run effective businesses and to upgrade clients item using plates of spaghetti. From one system to the next system to the next, it's horrible, really horrible. So what we looked for when we went -- started the Salesforce journey was actually, we wanted something that we -- we want to stop building things, we're not a tech company, we never wanted to be a tech company. We're a really good financial services company, who offered to stop building things and stop buying things that weren't fit for purpose. And that could give us that entire end-to-end offering that we could put out there. So whether we had our client base in there, our adviser data in there, the AppExchange really appealed to us. The ability to just go and pool things that already work, already connected and we could have that complete offering, which was really important to us.</p><p>Financial Services Cloud was just the obvious choice really, it really was. In terms of improvement, I think when we first purchased it, not sure we knew what we purchased or what the case ability was. It's taken us a while to get around that. We've been working with our integration partner to really understand that. And that fulfilled a very good relationship with Salesforce as well. I'd like to see 2 (inaudible) probably improve. One we first started, that was a huge focus on Financial Services Cloud for the U.S. and upgrade, doesn't work so well in the U.K.; we need some focus around it. But it has improved, we're now working really closely with Salesforce, and that two-way conversation about actually to make it really useful tool in the U.K., what would we like to see in that and actually that they're using us in the same way to get information and ideas. I think that's working really well. I think that has improved in the last 18 months.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Thank you.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: So Health Cloud is still relatively early in its maturation. That said, I've already given my view generally of health care's vertical. So the parts of it that we're using right now, we're very, very happy with and that's Marketing Cloud and sales, et cetera. As we think -- there was a start to roll out Health Cloud, what we have seen and understand about it is that it requires less arduous journey to configure it the way that you need to configurate it, right? And I loved the conversation earlier about customization versus configuration because it really is what it is. And you've got to educate often members of the executive team about what that means in your organization. So we know that and we've scoped it all and as we work through it, we know that the amount of work we have to do to make Health Cloud work for our purposes and our call center for instance and as we want to roll it out across the other parts of our organization isn't nearly as detailed and to echo what Karen said, it's the -- the off-the-shelf integrations that already exist, right? Including some with partners we already worked with, like Kyruus for online scheduling. It just makes the process of implementation so much easier that we're super, I think, satisfied and excited about where it can go. I really don't have any feedback yet on improvement. I think we are watching as it evolves. And one of the things that I find useful about working with Salesforce is that you're always seeking our feedback as you develop these products. We're always being called in and offered opportunities to help guide where the product goes and so it's not as if you just walk in 1 day and say, \"Here it is, good luck.\" It feels like it's been more of a partnership, even in the development of the base product.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Are you part of one of our Advisory Councils?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I am, at least one.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes. And so who are some of the other companies that maybe you participated with? Out of curiosity, I honestly don't know.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: So here NYU Langone is on its -- God, I don't remember all of them, there's some folks in Indiana maybe. I honestly don't remember all of the members of the panel, but it's -- generally speaking, other health systems are pretty forward thinking about building that individualized view of the customer. Those are the ones you're participating.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. And when you say customer, do you mean the patient?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I do.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Okay.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I use that -- I use those words interchangeably, much to the chagrin of physicians in my organization. Patient and customer and consumer are the same thing, right? And you can try to differentiate it. \"Ooh, right here they're a consumer but then they're a patient,\" and doctors love to do that because it makes them feel important, but I -- and they are important, don't get me wrong. I tend to treat doctors like pilots, right? You really do need a really competent pilot to get your plane from here to there, but pilots don't get to make marketing decisions at Delta, right? So everybody stay in their lane.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes. That's great. Mike, can you enlighten us a little bit?</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Yes. When we rolled out Salesforce 5 years ago, there was a -- I mean we knew the pitfalls of customization, right? And going back in almost an ERP, right? And so there was a rule that said, if anybody is going to customize Salesforce, the President of the bank would want it to be updated and he had to approve it. I mean he said, \"I want this going in vanilla\" because he was going for speed and so I want it out of the box, I don't want to change -- I mean we're going to change our process to match Salesforce rather than try to beat Salesforce, right?</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: And we -- absolutely. At that level, any customization has to be sponsored.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: All right. The challenge is, as you start to integrate with other apps, right? And if -- and Salesforce continues to evolve, so we rolled out Sales Cloud and then you come out with Financial Services Cloud, so we roll out Financial Services Cloud, now we got a problem because we want those 2 to talk to each other. Salesforce wants us to upgrade Sales Cloud and Financial Services Cloud and cross talking like -- so ideally, all of our corporate sales data is in Sales Cloud, but our wealth data is in Financial Services Cloud and obviously, you want to understand the wealth people that are in the corporate bank and start selling them on the wealth site. So we're working with Salesforce, and many of you are making that easier to cross right now between -- that's the challenge. And then as you acquired Tableau, I think we've done some custom integration with Tableau. It's always if you go ahead of the vendor, you're in trouble because when they integrate it, you've got to back retro stuff, you're out and reintegrating with theirs. So we'd love to see you make that seamless between Tableau and Salesforce, especially around the security model. We keep certain lines of business, aren't allowed to see other lines of business sales activity and certain people. And so we had to do some custom work with Tableau to make that -- if we're integrating a Tableau dashboard, make sure it was enforcing some of the security role. So that would be, I think, something as you move forward. And then I think, we haven't been a MuleSoft customer because we really haven't gone cloud to cloud, cross cloud, but I think as Brent showed. Like as we buy other apps that aren't sitting in Salesforce and they're sitting over in Azure. That I think MuleSoft is going to help us pull that together back, right? We have webMethods on-prem, right? So we've been a legacy webMethods shop and we've been using that if you're trying get to our legacy, but we don't -- if you're going cloud to cloud, I think MuleSoft is going to be more relevant to us as we go forward. That's just some of the big news.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: So can I put you on the spot?</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Sure. But I was already on the spot if you...</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Are the -- what are the insights, an example of some of the analytics and insights that you've gotten by using Tableau across CRM and then some of your other systems, maybe back office, middle office kind of stuff? Like, where's the gold in that from the standpoint of delivering to your business?</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: So yes, we have 800 applications at the bank that we track, but the data supply chain has about 130 of them that pull. So those are a lot of the core systems, all your transaction systems, all your sore systems that are relevant, there's a lot of other stuff that isn't relevant. And we made a rule when we first launched Salesforce, at least, I told them we're not moving all our data to Salesforce.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: No.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: We won't. We will take all the data out of Salesforce and put it in our data cloud, do analytics there, and push insights back up to Salesforce. And so some of the interesting work that's going on there, people are -- especially when we do transaction analytics, right? So we get all -- ACH checks and everything and we're analyzing that for corporate customers and doing insights for the sales teams that say, hey, we can see that this customer is especially in small business using another merchant service bank because we can see them getting deposits from another merchant service bank. So we'll look at that and analyze it and then pipe those as lead opportunities back into Salesforce for that -- RMs, that salesperson and say, \"Look, your client is using another bank,\" and we can see it in the transactions, we can see what they're doing, like we can see who they're paying, we can see -- and we can look for who they're paying, who they're doing Merchant Services with or other payment activity. So that's one where you don't need a lot of machine learning to do that, that's just kind of analyzing the data and then piping it back into Salesforce. But we are -- done some, we call it, the term internally is, banker wow. How do we get a wow factor to that banker that they're excited about using Salesforce and how do we help them. And there's some -- how do we tell them, \"Hey, you've got -- here's your quota, and based on the Einstein Discovery and some of the predictions, this is your best opportunity that we think have high likelihood to close and you should focus your time there\"? And how do we make that tool, a tool that they love to use and they will use as opposed to an enforcement tool, where they feel like \"I got to log my contacts, so you know who I'm calling\"? And that's the journey we're in right now. And then we've kind of centralized our analytics team for the bank, for banking analytics. And we're talking about the last-mile problem, right? So we have all the data in to do, but we haven't -- he can run machine learning models outside and that was a challenge, like Einstein was kind of limited to what was in Salesforce and we want to do machine learning across what was outside of Salesforce. But how do we -- how fast can they run machine learning models and then drive those insights back in and how do you make that seamless to the data scientist? Because right now it's a little -- it's not seamless. So that last mile of getting it from the machine learning, the insights of the machine learning into Salesforce, into the hands of the person who can use it, whether that person is a salesperson or a contact center person or a branch person, right? That's the journey we're on. I think you're on that, too, of how do you make that really seamless in that insights, whether it's next best action, next best product or lead or opportunity scores, right? And so that's the exciting part, marrying up the analytics with the Salesforce and making that compelling for them.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Matt, could you draw the same analogy for where you might find that same kind of business value through insights and analytics based on what you guys are doing in health care?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: Happy to do it. So another depressing, if you pull up the curtain at all on health care, you get super depressed. So we didn't have any sort of central data warehouse or any really understanding of our business, seriously, until about 6 years ago. And then that process has happened fairly quickly. And Tableau has introduced on top of the data warehouse as well. But I'll give an example, this year -- this past fiscal year, online scheduling was a big push for us. So we were trying to deliver the kind of experience that you have in every other part of your life to schedule with physicians and our retail clinics. And we had a pretty aggressive goal of getting to about 13.5% of our total appointment volume booked online. And so that required us to really dig into as we had a soft launch of online scheduling. So we had a data set that we could start to dig into to understand which of our customers were more likely to do it. And a lot of it's intuitive, you would guess younger folks, more urban audiences are going to be the ones who use it, but you start to derive specific insights around the kind of customers that are interested in using online booking or have done it with us to start targeting more of our marketing in direct outreach through our practices to those customers. And then another part of the Salesforce Platform that we use, DMP on the Marketing Cloud, you can actually start to build models around who these folks are and saw that -- so we started marketing without DMP just as a base test of -- and then we -- as we started to implement DMP targeting, we saw a 10% lift in appointments made from those customers, right? And so this was a combination of bringing all of it together, you bring the Tableau insights, we had to build our own insights team on our -- on the marketing side because the business intelligence folks couldn't do it. But then you get those insights and you apply it specifically to a business problem. And we were -- in May, we were at 12% of our total appointments booked online, which is a huge lift from -- we started the year below 4%. So it's -- and we would not have been able to do without the insights and then also the tools to target folks more capably.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: And what's the pool? Just out of curiosity. How many appointments do you guys (inaudible) in your universe?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: We see diverse, ambulatory to office appointments, we do about 2.2 million a year-ish. So we service about 2.5 million to 3 million customers a year, patients.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Wow. Great. I'm getting confused.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I don't know if there's any doctors in the room.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Karen, you obviously have a team that's working on this whole adviser thing and also probably a really big challenge that looks quite a bit like health care, where those advisers don't work for you. So what are some of the strategies or the way you're engaging with them to make them love what you're delivering. The banker wow part is a very -- is a cool word. What are the tactics you're deploying?</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: We call them window tappers. My problem at the moment is keeping them away. I can't run this program fast enough to keep everybody happy. Every other day it's, \"I hear you're doing the Salesforce thing. Can we have a look at it please and when can we play?\" So my problem isn't getting our advisers on board. As I said, we've made their life difficult. We built our company over 28 years, and we've allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do. If not been able to successfully integrate into all of our data and because it's -- lots of different systems and data in lots of different places, they are now saying to me, \"Give me something. Tell me something. Give me something I can use end-to-end to make my day easier so I can spend more time with my clients and less time processing business.\" Our problem won't be adoption. It will not be adoption. Our problem will be delivering at a speed that's fast enough to keep them happy. It's a nice problem to have. We've had to take our technology team with us because we're also delivering this on the business side and it's taken a while to get our technology team to accept that this really is the future, guys, this is what we're doing. This is what our advisers and our clients want. They have faith. Pick up first and it looks it dragging, but they've got there. And so they aren't our main issue really, but actually putting this in hands of the advisers, we'll be fine. I have no problem with that at all.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: We have a very similar dynamic in our health system, and I think in health systems generally. The IT departments are often the biggest hurdle to moving in this direction, particularly for folks like us that have lots of really substantial investments in on-premise enterprise platforms. It's hard for them to get their brains around what we're doing. And also to understand and I have this conversation with my boss, the CEO, all the time, that one of the beauties of a platform like this is that we just bite off the chunks we need, right? I don't have to make a $200 million investment as much as you guys might enjoy that. A $200 million investment in this platform the way we did with EPIC, right? It's much easier for us to take this as we need it and to build it as it comes. It does present some integration issues later, but I think we can all get that solved.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Great. Super. Okay. Questions? You want to go first, Brent? I guess, he's the host, he gets to, right guys?</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Just love to just get a better view on the Salesforce journey and now this data journey. And couple of years ago, there wasn't really a data journey, now there is, and so we're seeing these journeys colliding here as they required MuleSoft and Krux, DMP and Tableau. So my question is, does your data journey accelerate now that it becomes part of the Salesforce umbrella or not? Just trying to understand how the data journey kind of changes or not once it's integrated with Salesforce.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: I'll start and you guys can jump in. So we spent the last 5 years modernizing our data lake on-prem. We're now on a journey moving into the cloud, right? And right now, we're moving towards Google, but it could be Google, could have been Amazon, it could be Snowflake, right? But it all go to cloud. And data has gravity, right? So where a data sits, you kind of want machine learning to happen there, right? But you want the -- then you can send the insights. So if we move our data to the cloud, I think it does change our kind of MuleSoft view, which is, now I need Salesforce talking to another cloud, right? For all of its insights and analytics across, right? And I don't know if the Salesforce is competing in that complete data warehouse space yet, right? So I mean they are in their own kind of world but not against BigQuery, not against Snowflake, not against Amazon, Redshift. So our view right now is, we're moving the data to the cloud and we're meeting with the CEO next couple of weeks to talk, and we've told our Board that. Like, our data has gone to the cloud because that's where the analytics capabilities are. And then we'll cross and then we'll run Tableau in the cloud and we'll run all of our machine learning in the cloud, now we'll need cloud-to-cloud integration, right? So it does change kind of our integration, but the fact that Salesforce bought Tableau means that, that visualization capability, and I know Brent and I were talking when they bought Tableau, we're like, \"Wow, who's going to buy -- Google bought Looker, who's going to buy click, right?\" And Amazon doesn't have a play there right now, right? And so I think it's interesting if Salesforce does have that visualization. And they have a machine learning inside your own data sets, but it's not clear to me yet how Einstein machine learning and data in another cloud will interact, right? And that's I think a journey that we'll be on with Salesforce, too.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Bit of a new frontier.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Yes.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I think it's clinically important for us because we can't realize the full potential of the data we own without some sort of integration layer into Salesforce, right? So this is probably -- I don't know what you guys have plans, they don't tell me everything. But right now, there's no clear -- there's no easy way to integrate EPIC, for instance, in Salesforce, right? And so without MuleSoft, we don't have a way of getting everything we know about our customers into a platform where we can actually use it, right? And activate against it and engage. So we -- honestly, I think Salesforce and their desire to use it more broadly across our organization is actually helping us get deeper into the conversation and get a little more focused on some of the data issues we've had around standardization and governance of data that we really weren't as focused on as we needed to be because as soon as we started having this internal conversation well, I need to see everything we know about our customers in EPIC through Salesforce. The folks who own EPIC, which is the IT folks in our organization, started to have a seizure and needed to understand really quickly how they were going to make that happen. And we said, \"Well, by the way, we have these friends, they're called MuleSoft. We'll bring them to the table.\" And so MuleSoft actually is leading -- helping lead the conversation now inside of our organization about getting all these varied data streams into a place where we can use them. It's great.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Have you thought about exposing those APIs to your partners and maybe your customers so they can get a bit of their own data?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: Yes. So obviously, they've -- with the health care information, with HIPAA, privacy is very important in our business.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: They (inaudible).</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: I mean it is their own data from the customer's perspective. The one place we've explored most is with Apple health records because it's relatively easy thing to do with our particular EHR, EPIC, it's a simple thing to flip on. But we haven't really -- we haven't gotten to that point yet, right? I think there's places we could go with that, but we're not quite there. I think a lot of it will come as we use -- a lot of them -- what I want to do for our customers to help them personalize their digital experience with Piedmont is hooked to our ability to complete this EPIC, MuleSoft/Salesforce marriage, right? Because the tools that I will build on top of that, primarily using Salesforce, is how I expect to do it, so there's a lot hinging on it.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Okay. Got it. Did I see another question in the back? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I thought, Mike, you made an interesting comment when you said that you changed your business processes to align with Salesforce. And I guess for everybody, I wonder if -- are you worried in doing that, you may lose some differentiation or uniqueness if everybody else is also using a CRM in the Salesforce and the similar processes.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: I don't think it was a big deal for -- I wouldn't say our sales practices were best-in-class, so I don't think it was -- I think it was a pretty easy call for us -- thoughts.</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: It's the same for us. Our USC is not in that process. It is actually in the face to face, the vital relationship with the client that their processing of the business, it is just really straightforward. It should be a thing that it should just happen. If we're relying on that client value, we've got it wrong.</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: What she said.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: So I have one more question and we'll close it up for you. So when I think about what we do, we basically -- and how we think about what we build, et cetera, I mean, a big piece of the value to our clients is the fact that we pool the money and we spend the money on more innovation that you either tell us or we do market analysis or whatever. And I think if I think back to sort of what are some of the things that customers are remarking about that they're very eager to try, we already talked about My Trailhead. I think the partners gave some really good examples there. Two other key investment areas and recent things that we have invested in as sort of the future of intelligent platforms and the future of CRM is one is voice and actually being able to talk to your application and have your application talk to you. I'm particularly excited about that because people don't like to use keyboards, so that's like a big shift. And then the second one is blockchain. And I'd just sort of be interested in 2 industries where compliance and governance and rule enforcement and security and all those things, being both financial services and health care, kind of how you think about where those might shape just the way you think about how you interact and your employees interact or your customers interact with technologies. So just kind of a little what could be out there sort of a conversation. Do you want to start with something, Karen?</p><p>KAREN STEVENS;ST. JAMES'S PLACE WEALTH MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL PROPOSITION DIRECTOR: We're really intrigued by both. We're very conscious of our client bankers of an older generation and we have an intergenerational push going on at the moment. Our younger clients want to be able to interact with technology digitally, but I've watched how my children interact with technology. They don't tap away at things, they talk to things. And so the voice thing really intrigues us because we think that might be a key to unlocking some better client experience for our younger clients. Blockchain is a bit too early for us. We're not that advanced yet.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Matt, just some thoughts on that?</p><p>MATT GOVE;PIEDMONT HEALTHCARE; CHIEF CONSUMER OFFICER: Sure. And similar opinion on blockchain generally, although I think there's a lot of promise there given the need for us to be able to share information broadly and do it securely and privately. But voice, we've been waiting for a while for the voice platforms to become HIPAA compliant. Alexa now is, right? So Amazon has gotten there. And I think that allows us to think about some of the consumer-friendly tools that we need to offer, online scheduling being the primary one, making that an easier process is something we're very interested in now. But we also recognize, very similar to what Karen said, that we've got customers. One of the things I love about health care, one of the reasons I got into health care was because everybody has to touch us at some point, right? But our super users are more on the older end of the scale and have -- sometimes have a more difficult time with technology. And so how do we introduce the tools that are going to ensure that tomorrow's generation of super users becomes attached to Piedmont while still satisfying the needs of the current generation is what we're trying to solve. So voice is one of those places we want to work on, but we can't spend too much time on it because we still got tons of opportunity in the existing customers.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Mike?</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Yes. I think for banks, voice, we're behind in that space but we're pitching to the Board that we need to get more aggressive in the voice digital chat bot stuff, and we're studying all the players, Salesforce, Amazon, Google. So voice is important. I think consumers have adopted voice, whether it's Alexa, Siri, Hey Google, they accept voice. And so I think it's prime for everybody to start delivering voice interfaces, voice detect, sentiment text analytics, all that stuff, right? And the capabilities are all -- they're getting commoditized and readily available and pretty easy to use. So that's great and it's on the cloud. I don't think anybody wants to try to install that on-prem, even though it's available.</p><p>And blockchain, we've been giving Board updates on blockchain for 2 years, right? Because it's everywhere and all the Board wants to know what's going on in blockchain. Our perspective on blockchain is, especially as a regional bank, we're not going to be the market-maker. Like somebody -- if you're going to do a blockchain and if someone is pulling together the network and making the network work, right? And the trillionaire banks would do that globally and we'll ride on those rails, just like we ride on fed wire rails or ACH rails. So someone will build it, and if they use blockchain, cool. That's interlinked technology, that's great. To us, it'll look like an app, right? So in Ohio, we're working with a business leader in Ohio that's got -- kind of evangelizing blockchain. He used to sell cars. Now he wants to be a blockchain expert. And he held a blockchain conference in Cleveland last year. He got head of Oracle, Mark Hurd to come out and everybody. And -- but one of -- he's got 2 apps because he used to do cars, so he's trying to work with all the states to put auto titles on a blockchain, right? So you get the state using a blockchain, the banks to work with the app, the insurance companies to work with the app, so that if we're putting liens on a car title, we can put it on digitally, right? Now to me, it could be digital, it could be blockchain, I don't care. Yes, we'll use it if you build it because we take liens and put liens on it and it'll all be paperless. And if the state accepts it, that's great. But we haven't found one where we feel like we as a bank would be the one that builds it on blockchain, right? Somebody else will build it and it'll look like a SaaS app to us and we'll use it, right?</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: It's like maps.</p><p>MIKE ONDERS;KEYBANK;EVP CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DIVISION CIO CLIENT INSIGHTS AND MARKETING: Yes.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Yes. Okay. So John, I think we're at time. Are we, Brent?</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Yes.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: I think we are. You want to close this out?</p><p>JOHN CUMMINGS: Yes. Sure.</p><p>POLLY A. SUMNER: Well, first of all, let's give this great panel a round of applause. If you can come down and get out of the way, thank you.</p><p>JOHN CUMMINGS: Great. So it's on? Here we go. So first of all, thank you. Thanks all for taking the time to spend with us today. We appreciate it. We appreciate your support. In the theme of thank yous, I want to thank Polly and Kori for your time and the effort to bring your customers here today, and we appreciate that. I'd also like to give a callout to Anna Saliba on the IR team for helping put this great event together, and Rose Salzwedel in IR and Evan Goldstein, my partner in finance here as well. So thanks, guys, for being here today. Brent, thank you for putting this all together and look forward to doing more of this. Let me pass it to you.</p><p>BRENT ALAN BRACELIN: Great. Again, I'll say thanks to the Salesforce team. And just to remind everyone, although it's been, what, 15 years almost since the Salesforce IPO, I think we have a great another 15 years ahead to talk more about cloud. So apologize if you're bored of talking about it, but there's still great opportunities there. So thank you all.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

My name is Murat S\u00c3\u00b6nmez, I'm a member of the Managing Board of the World Economic Forum and head of the new center we established in San Francisco on the 4th Industrial Revolution. It's a privilege and pleasure to welcome all of you to our session on achieving inclusive growth in the 4th Industrial Revolution, which is not only the theme of this session, but the whole meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we know, the 4th Industrial Revolution is impacting every aspects of life, from business to society to government and even to who we are and our own identity. But as we move forward in the 4th Industrial Revolution, we cannot leave people behind, and achieving inclusive growth is essential just to make sure that everybody participates in the benefits of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and also, we minimize the downside of it. And our distinguished panel with us will discuss that today.</p><p>This is the reason why the World Economic Forum decided to open a center dedicated to this topic in San Francisco, taking a look at specific technologies with a human-centric approach and identifying the positive impact to the citizens and to the society and working backwards to develop the governance protocols and the policy frameworks to make sure that we accelerate the positive impact and minimize the negative impact.</p><p>It is an applied research center where we sit down with industry leaders, government leaders, start-ups, international organizations, top research universities and co-design these protocols and implement them through pilot implementations.</p><p>We all welcome -- we all invite you, all of you, to join us at the center and reach out to your counterpart at the World Economic Forum, if you're interested. With that, I'll hand over the session to my colleague, Nick Davis, to kick it off. Nick, the floor is yours.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Murat, and thank you, everyone, for being here. This session is titled the same as the theme of this conference, achieving inclusive growth in the 4th Industrial Revolution. And I want to start by reminding us all that science and technology are not ends in themselves, neither really is economic progress.</p><p>The point of us being here as part of the World Economic Forum network and community, the point of the activities that we do when we're not lucky enough to sit here and talk about technology is really to improve our own and others' lives in different ways. And possibly, the greatest challenge of any industrial revolution is making sure that those who are normally vulnerable or excluded are able to participate in it. And so the topic of discussion and the channel -- challenge for this panel is to ask ourselves the question what do we need to do to make the coming, the ongoing revolution in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnologies, 3D printing, neurotech, space exploration and new frontiers in almost every part of science, how do we make sure that those are truly inclusive and able to benefit the largest number of people.</p><p>And it's a fantastic opportunity to sit here and discuss this in China, not just because China is a world leader in science and technology, but you may know that China and the economic progress, the improvement in living standards here, in this country, over the last 30 years was responsible for more than half, well more than half of the global increase in living standards and reduction in numbers of people in poverty. And so it's here that we have 4 fantastic, distinguished panelists to give us a vision, but not just a vision, some practical ideas about what all of us can do to help achieve that sense of inclusion, those real benefits to people around the world as a result of the exciting technology that many of you are working on and developing. And to do this, we have Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, from Singapore, who's also the coordinating minister for social and economic affairs. We have Jean Liu, who is the President of Didi Chuxing, a very well-known and exciting ridesharing company and more here in China. We have a member of the forum's Board of Trustees, but also Chairman, CEO and founder of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, and a close friend of the forum as well. And finally, the distinguished economist, Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics from George Mason University. And I hope that this will be an opportunity for the panelists to have a little bit of a debate and a challenge to each other and to you as well before we finish in about 48 minutes time.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: I'm going to open by turning to first speaker on my left here, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, maybe to set the stage for us a little bit. What is the current context for inclusive growth? Where do we stand today, and what worries and excites you?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, thanks a lot. I think the broad description of the problem is first one of middle class stagnation across a broad range of the more advanced economies. And second, it has to be emphasized because it's not [substantially] noticed is the fact that we haven't had much catch up from most of the developing world with the advanced world. The conventional theories of economic development just haven't played out with the exception of 4 smaller Asian economies in the '70s and '80s and now coastal China. But those are exceptions. If you look at Africa, if you look at the broad swath of South Asia, if you look at Latin America, there's been very little movement relative to the [frontier]. Let's say if you look at American levels of productivity and incomes and if you look at what's happened since the '60s till now, there's been very little movement, very little convergence from less developed in the direction of -- or in catching up with the most developed. Globalization, national economies just haven't played out in the way they should. The source of the problem we know for the first issue, a middle class stagnation, is weak productivity growth, and this is something which economists on the left and right would agree on, that if you don't have a sustained uplift of productivity growth, we're not going to get an uplift of median incomes or incomes of the broad middle. That, I think, we agree on.</p><p>The source of that problem is that we actually don't have that much disruption happening in our economies. Despite all that's said about Google and Facebook and the latest developments in AI, the spread of new technologies isn't that wide. The Internet may appear to be everywhere, but it's not really used that intensively. And most new technologies escape the large, small and medium enterprise sector of most economies, and they escape whole sectors apart from a few leaders in each sector, so that the fusion of new technologies has not been rapid and large parts of the advanced economies, in fact, most economies, don't have enough disruption. So we need more disruption.</p><p>Second problem, the lack of catch-up and lack of convergence, I would say, also reflects a lack of globalization. In fact, most of Africa, most of South Asia, most of Latin America is not inserted in the global economy, they are inserted within semi-protected economies or they're just not part of the market economy. So we need more disruption, more technological innovation and more globalization, a little contrary to what some of the magazine articles will tell us. But it's only going to work if we have more activist social strategies as well, which is a domestic policy imperative. Because without active social compacts formed through federal and local government initiative and public-private initiatives, it's very difficult for us to sustain an era of greater disruption, because jobs and firms will be disrupted, and to sustain globalization and bring it up to a new level, including a much larger part of the world. And I think that the interesting story coming out of the last few years, when you think of activist social policies, it's not just traditional redistribution, about 1% against 99% or 10% against 90% and how you go about redistributing, it's about the failure to regenerate towns and the failure to integrate neighborhoods in a whole range of countries. If you look at the Brexit vote, if you look at the U.S. presidential elections last year, if you look at even voting patterns in Instanbul, Paris, Moscow, a whole range of places, voting patterns are very different in the most -- the largest most cosmopolitan cities compared to the suburbs, the smaller towns and the countryside, starkly different in Brexit, starkly different in the U.S. presidential elections, and that's telling us something. We have to think about the local. We have to think about how we help local communities regenerate themselves, and the traditional methods of redistribution just don't do it. It has to be about specialization, has to be about capabilities. It has to be about communities of learning and communities of mutual help.</p><p>And that works at the local level, very rarely works continental scale economy or national level. But it works at the local level because people know each other, you know who the employers are, the employers know who's in the community college or the universities or high schools. You can actually form a community, a community of learning, a community of mutual help. And far more attention in social policy, federal and local, across a whole range of countries has to be paid to these local factors, regenerating communities because disruption will have to be part of life. If it's not part of life, we're going to get stuck at low productivity growth, and we're going to get stuck at incomes that just don't change from one generation to another or start slipping, which is what's happened.</p><p>Finally, just one quick point because the biggest issue is really about the emerging world, the developing world and the lack of catch-up. And we have to think very hard there of how we use technology to make access to the modern world and to make access to global markets much easier and much cheaper for small enterprise and for individuals. And the good thing is that it can be done. Broadband can be put in place. High-speed broadband. Regulatory systems can be changed so as to protect incumbents less and encourage new players to come in because competition is quite essential in the IT space and in the technology space, generally, it's what promotes innovation. In fact, there's a long way to go in regulatory reform in a whole range of developing countries to be able to bring in new technologies faster. And the real beneficiary -- we know who the losers are amongst incumbents, but the real beneficiary is a much broader swath of small players and individuals. And we have to make this move because the consequences are dire if we don't achieve this. It's not just about some countries being left behind, it's going to be consequences of a geopolitical nature.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Tharman. So taking us from the big picture context of the challenges facing us, down to some of the innovations in policy as well as the old tasks that we know that we still have yet to complete in economic policy as well on that. So Jean, you are one of the disruptors that Tharman talked about there. And here in China, you have a grand vision for the sharing economy and mobility. Talk us through how your version of this fits into inclusivity and inclusive growth.</p><p>JEAN LIU: Thank you. I totally agree with Deputy Prime Minister on disruption. I think we do need more disruption on technology and on business model. But at the end of the day, we need to figure out why do we need those. We need those to benefit humanity, to serve every individual in this room. So in our daily work, what we are trying to do, which is to maximize the benefit of technology and sharing economy to serve 2 purposes. So the first one is on the resource problem. That is a problem that's facing all human being right now on this planet. For example, if all Beijing, Shanghai people want to copy the lifestyle of Los Angeles, then we will have a resource crisis again. So the sharing economy and the data science we are utilizing today is basically to improve the utilization rate of all the cars, of the road space, of all the energies. So that's the #1 point. And I think without this new business model, we cannot imagine what will happen on resource. And second, more importantly, is from an economy perspective, what it's doing to all of us. Everyone knows China is going through this restructuring economy. And actually, on our platform, most of the drivers are part-time drivers. They earn the second income for their family, so they are young graduates who haven't figured out what they want to do for their lifetime. They are stay-at-home moms. They're coal miners who will lose their jobs very soon, right? And in our platform, we provide them dignity for life. For example, about 2 million drivers on our platform earn at least $30 a day. And if you do the math, monthly rate is 3x of China's minimum wage. So we help these people to transition for their next stop in their life. We're not saying they will do this job forever, but this is to prepare them for the next challenge. And from a bigger-scale perspective, this is to prepare our economy for the next challenge. So it's not just serving as the landing cushion, it's also a launching pad for our economy. So that's what we are talking about these days.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: And just as a follow-up to this, you're also been involved in other parts of the sharing economy, and I know that Ofo and Mobike consumer-led schemes have started to take this using the Internet of Things approach to sharing bicycles. How fast is the sharing economy growing in China? What's the potential here that you see to transform cities and to perform other tasks?</p><p>JEAN LIU: It's huge. And after 5 years -- we're a young company, very young company. But after 5 years, we provide 20 million rides on a daily basis, which is 2x of the other markets adding up together. And it's not just -- and also, it's not just to provide private car share, it's also taxi, minibus, buses and bikes on our platform. So that's the other beauty of sharing economy. I think it also provide inclusive growth here, so everyone can have a fair access to mobility service. It's not just for higher-income people, for lower-income people can also have easier access to service they would like to enjoy.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you. Turning to Marc. We've talked a little bit about the macro contextual problems. We've talked about a set of technologies here building on digital and the sharing economy, touching on IoT. But the 4th Industrial Revolution is being driven by lots of exciting and some unknown and uncertain technologies. When you look from where you are in San Francisco, out into the world of emerging technology, where do you see some areas that we need to be excited and dynamic about and where are some areas that we maybe need to be worried about inclusion and thoughtful before they come out?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF, </nameText></person>CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SALESFORCE.COM, INC.: Good. Okay, well, thanks, Nick. First of all, let me reinforce what Murat said, which is that the World Economic Forum is building a very exciting new center in San Francisco, in the Presidio, which is called the Center for the 4th Industrial Revolution. It's based on many of the concepts that Nick wrote about in the books that you've seen published by the World Economic Forum with Klaus Schwab and these incredible world-changing concepts with regard to technology and shifts that are going on. And there are so many exciting new technologies that are emerging, both in the biological sciences, as you know, and also information technology. The biggest shift on the technology side that we can see happening today is certainly artificial intelligence, and artificial intelligence is growing now at a just much faster rate than ever expected. And it's not just machine intelligence, it's not just machine learning, it's also deep learning, and other really incredible new characteristics of artificial intelligence, including vision and object detection and others, but this idea that there's this broad new platform, which is what AI is, it's an incredible new platform that I think that if any of us were to start our companies over again, we would start with the AI as the platform and build up. Today, many of us are including now and building AI within our existing platforms. That's probably true of almost every company that I'm thinking of today that's in the mainstream. And the artificial intelligence is going to have dramatic effects and dramatic changes on our society and dramatically improve not just our health care, not just our levels of productivity, but it's also going to be very disruptive. And I think a lot of us realize that it will also create an incredible crisis of equality. And this crisis of equality is going to really shake our society in many different areas. And the crisis of equality that artificial intelligence will bring will, I think, really make us look at some of the foundational aspects of society. Of course, we're going to probably look at things like basic income, but we're probably also going to look at things like how do we build new models of education and learning, especially as we start to displace more and more workers. We heard Premier Li today speak about how as larger companies bring in these next generations of automation that workers, in many cases, indeed are displaced, and that's why there's more reliance today on new business creation and next-generation small and medium businesses. Well, I couldn't agree with him even more than that. He's absolutely right. But what I can also tell you is that this crisis of equality is going to also affect how we manage our companies and lead them. And I think we saw that playing out today -- this week, in the newspapers and the magazines around the world. And we saw that Uber went through a significant change in their management structure, the CEO was fired and one of the board members left and so forth. What happened? Well, it wasn't that long ago, it's only in February that there was really an incredible article, incredible article written by one of their executives, Susan Fowler, who really just pointed out that they had created a culture that was not about equality. And it triggered inside a true 4th Industrial Revolution company, Uber, a crisis of equality. And you could see it start to play out to the point where women felt unsafe to work at Uber, and that is a terrible situation for any company, and it's certainly a terrible situation for women when they feel that way that they don't feel safe in an organization. And this, I believe, is going to be reflected in society going forward. When we talk about inclusive growth, which is the title of this. What that means to me is equality. It means that we are including everybody. That is we are including all genders, all races, all sexual orientations, everyone. We include everyone. We treat them equally. We give them equal opportunity. We pay them equally. The World Economic Forum writes an incredible, incredible report. And if you haven't read some of the work that Satya has done, I mean, the gender pay report, okay, says that it's going to still take us 170 years before we have gender pay equality. This should be a sign that we have throughout our organizations these very serious problems that need to be addressed today. So we must search for greater levels of equality within ourselves and that this will be absolutely a critical and intrinsic part of this 4th Industrial Revolution. And if you think that any company or any country or any nongovernmental organization will escape that crisis of equality, I assure you that none will. And that's kind of where I see it as of right now.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you very much, Marc. And I want to come back to Jean in a minute to ask about how Didi is dealing with those same inclusion aspects in a fast-growing company here in China. But before I do, I'd like to turn to Tyler Cowen. Tyler, Tharman opened by saying he was concerned about a lack of disruption, a lack of dynamism in the global economy, and you've written about the great stagnation, about the complacent classes. And in fact, in some of that work pointed to the fact that technologies have had a role in perhaps distracting us or making us less dynamic, less attentive to some of the bigger problems around us. When we think about this challenge of inclusive growth and the need to be more dynamic, what's your take on what countries, what people, what organizations need to do? And how does it look from the economics perspective from where you stand, looking at the data and not just at discussions and corporate culture?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: If we look at most of the Western world, for at least 15 years, real wages for the middle class have been stagnant or, in a few cases, even falling. This is the most important fact of our times. So if you are reading that we are receiving a new technological cornucopia of incredible products, basically, that cannot be true. It would be showing up in the real wages of most people. I think in the United States, in particular, we have an economy with several quite stagnant sectors. Health care, almost 18% of our GDP. It's incredible, the highest in the world, yet, over the last 10 years, our mortality numbers have disappointed. They have come in below par. In many counties of my country, people are now dying sooner than they had 10 or 15 years ago. If you look at education, just ask a simple question, to date, how much has the Internet improved education in the United States? The answer is not quite 0, but the biggest thing that goes on/off and it's simply e-mailing your professor, there are now some MOOCs, we're not sure how well that will do. Most of education is unchanged, it's fairly stagnant. Simple core question for real people. What does it cost to buy a house in an above average school district. Every year, this costs more. And that cost going up is actually far more significant than most of the benefits that tech has brought us. Just a simple number that's really striking. We've talked about Uber. Let me say in passing, I'm much more optimistic about Didi than Uber. But you look at Uber in the United States, Uber hired Steve Levitt, one of the most famous economists in the world, to do a study what is the social benefit of Uber for each American, on average? This is a study done by Uber. The answer was $20, which is fine, great, $20 per person. How many of us in this room have produced $20 of value for each American? But at the end of the day, that's just like a fluctuation in your electricity bill or a fraction of your property tax increase. It's not that big a deal. So the Internet has made leisure much better. It's connected us to people much more. But it's very instructive to compare, say, the last 10 years of the Internet to 1995, 1998, which I would say was the true information technology revolution. In those years, IT was very powerful and you see output going up at a rate of higher than 3% in most sectors of the American economy. Right now, we're doing more with information, but so much of our economy resists improvement. Or look at government, we don't even know how to measure the quality of government. What does that tell you, right? Is government working hard to get us a means to do so? I would say not. In my country and many other countries, in my opinion, the quality of government probably is declining. So when you have such major sectors as health care, education and government either semi-stagnant or declining and disappointing, you can be doing a lot of things right, you can have heroic entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, which I'm a big fan of by the way. I love the big tech companies, I'm not anti-tech. But GDP is a huge mountain, and to make a dent in that mountain and have a growth rate of 3%, it's much, much harder than people realize. And right now, we are not there. We need more disruption. We need more entrepreneurship. And as we heard from Singapore, we need it for the whole world. Service sector productivity is stagnant even in Singapore. Even in Singapore, they cannot really get it to increase, and that tells you something. It is a hard problem.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you, Tyler. So this is the problem we're faced with. And back to you, Jean, because you're at the heart of this in trying to move a mountain in many ways. What's your response to Tyler on this?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. I think the key topic we're talking about is being inclusive here, and it's actually our company's philosophy. And I also want to address the point Professor Cowen just made. A lot of people think, for our industry, ridesharing, we compete with taxis fiercely, for example. But actually, it's not. We consider -- our philosophy is we should be inclusive of each other. And both taxis and ridesharing should be an alternative to private car sharing. That's a solution to the private car. If you think about China, which is the country I'm most familiar with, we have 150 million private car owners, I would say. Actually, we have 200 million cars and -- private cars. And if you assume every driver drives 1.5 times a day, that's maximum already, that's 300 million drivers. And in our vision, transportation in the long run will become, as a matter of fact, a service rather than a form of ownership, right. When transportation becomes a service, we can free, liberate, all these car owners then we can engage more taxi drivers and rideshare drivers, together, to work for people like all of us here. So that's being inclusive here, that's the benefit of being inclusive here. And also, we'll do a very good impact utilizing technology and based on sharing economy, and we will serve all of humanity. And the second part, on the diversity. I'm very glad that Marc talked about it. I think we also -- we're a company that truly believe in diversity. First of all, we are trying to go global. A lot of people are talking about Uber. We also see global market is the future market. Our philosophy is we have to create customer value. We have -- it's not we want to go global and we have to, it's if we can bring value to people there. And to bring value, we have to study very deeply what local customers need. So we have to respect local diversity. And from a company's culture perspective, we also need to understand each employee. What's their insights, what's their inner growth drivers? So for example, we have this women network, which I personally feel extremely passionate about. Didi has more than -- has 50% women employees and about 40% of senior women executives. So for example, we talk about how women can develop career in our company, and we encourage all the moms and pregnant women to take one day off -- to work from home, actually, every week. So that's from a company's perspective and also from a economic perspective, how we look at inclusive and diversity.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Perfect. So we're kind of orbiting around 2 of these important topics here. And I want to bring Tharman back in to maybe bring us down one more level. And picking up on Tyler's point about this really need to do something, this urgent need to do something. And yes, in Singapore, so you -- I'm sure you have many experiences about how reforming education, reforming government to develop more dynamism, but also transmitting that across the world in different ways is part of what you mentioned in the globalization of some of these ideas. You mentioned a few ideas before, but what are some practical examples that we can hook on to and maybe take back with us to our home cities or elsewhere to learn from and build on together?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, it's a couple of things. And I say this not because Singapore is a model for the world in any sense, but it has worked in Singapore reasonably well and there may be some interesting parallels with other cities. First, I think we have to reshape education and reverse the trend of over-academization that's taken place in the last 40 to 50 years almost everywhere, including in China, and India. The overemphasis on the academic track, not just in schools, but in tertiary education, such that the 4-year regular college education model has become dominant. It just doesn't meet the needs of the real world and it doesn't meet the needs of the natural spectrum of abilities that we have in any society. We have to take a step back and ask, how do we develop the talents, skills and enthusiasm of individuals in a way that's relevant to the real world, relevant to opportunities that face them in the market or opportunities that they can create in the market? And it requires a much more flexible blend of the academic and the practical, and it requires reinvestment at different points of your life. Far too much is front-loaded now into the first 18 to 22 years of life. And I think we all agree that, that investment was useful in a general sense, depreciates quite quickly and you've got to keep learning through life. But we don't have the infrastructure for learning through life. We don't have the financing schemes. And individuals are more or less on their own. Quite different from school where you've got a teacher and a headmaster or principal. In fact, far too much management and shepherding that takes place in the early years. And then you're left on your own, you're left on your own once you're in adult life. We need more curation, more mentoring, more advice, and a lot of it can be done at the local community level. And we have to develop that system, intermediaries, including intermediaries who are doing it for commercial reasons who can help individuals shape their future learning. We need financing to be spread out from this -- take the overconcentration in the early years and spread it out more through life, so at regular intervals in life, people can learn. We're trying to do it in Singapore through what we call SkillsFuture. It's our most important social and economic initiative. It's not just economic, it's social. It's ultimately a more egalitarian way of developing people through life compared to the traditional forms of meritocracy which take place largely in school systems.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Marc, you've worked a lot in the San Francisco and Bay Area, with schools and on the topic of education with Salesforce. What have you learned here about the opportunity for inclusion, particularly in the area of emerging technologies around new forms of education?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Well, I couldn't agree more with what my good friend from Singapore is talking about, and I hadn't heard the words over-academization. Is that what it is?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: I think I just said that.</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: How do you say it -- how do you pronounce it?</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: No, I won't try it again.</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Okay, I can't pronounce it. But anyway, I love that. And I completely agree with that. And I think it's absolutely connected as well to the gentleman on my left who really talked about the crisis of growth. So and I talked about the crisis of equality, and I'll try to start to weave these together and how they're related. So I think that when you start to look at what's going on, especially as these new technologies are coming in. And as I said, AI is kind of the mother of all technologies, if you will. And then, I've also said that the speed of that is coming in is unprecedented. So you're going to get this kind of high levels of job displacement, okay? And you're going to get increasing levels of productivity and efficiency. There's just no doubt about it. And that's going to further compound I think, some of the points that you made very well. And what you're going to have to get to is really what you talked about, which I think was great, which is when you talk about SkillsFuture, easier to pronounce, I -- one of the first things I did was I -- certainly, I want to be able to impact our new administration in the United States as much as I could, and I went to Washington, D.C. and I challenged President Trump. And I said, \"Look, my #1 thing that I would like you to do is to focus on 5 million apprenticeships in the United States by 2020. And that really make apprenticeships a national goal. Now, of course, I thought that he would completely resonate with the word apprentice, so I knew I had a running start on that, okay. So -- and in fact, he did. He said, \"Okay, I take your challenge. We're going to -- we'll go for this 5 million.\" And why I'm excited about that is because I think that as we get increasing levels of automation that we have got to be ready to rapidly retrain people and give them these kinds of apprenticeships or these SkillsFuture, and traditional academic means is not going to be the answer. Now to Nick's point, they better have solid reading and writing capability that you would see like in K-12, that the foundation and the fundamentals need to be there. But if those fundamentals are there, this opportunity to create apprenticeships, whether they're coming out of that K-8 environment or out of a high school environment or whether they're mature workers and they need to be retrained because their jobs have been replaced, we have got to be ready to have nationalized apprenticeship programs that are deeply integrated with the structures of our economy. And companies like mine, this is something that we are really focused on. Of course, Salesforce is the world's fastest-growing enterprise software company. We'll do over $10 billion in revenue this year. We have over 26,000 employees. We're the #1 customer relationship management provider in the world. Everyone who's attended this conference has used Salesforce because the World Economic Forum runs on Salesforce and all of these systems that you've been using at the core of them is the Salesforce system. Now because we've built a platform, what that allows us to do is to create jobs because we are training people on how to administer and build and create and develop on that platform. Much in the same way that Didi is doing it with their cars and their systems, we're doing that as well. And we predict, through with a partnership with IDC, that we'll add 2 million jobs to the global economy and $400 billion in GDP by 2020 through our platform. So this idea that we need next-generation platforms for growth, I think, that this is something that, in my personal life, I can see is true. And I think, for Didi, it's also true. And I can probably give you dozens of examples of next-generation technology companies that are able to take these tech companies, create platforms, create opportunities not just to sell you an app for your phone, but to create something that's going to give employment and sustenance for people worldwide. And I think that, that's going to be something that we're going to see. That said, I've also said before, well I said it in Davos in January, and I'd love to hear the economist view on this, which is basic income, I think, will become a part of a society. And also, I'm sure you've thought about that as well, but that's a super controversial thing to say that there's going to be some kind of basic income needed. But as we get these very, very high levels of automation through artificial intelligence, we're going to have to ask ourselves, are we going to provide basic income through our government?</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Well, it's a great topic to bring up with 11 minutes to go in this session. But -- and I do want to get Tyler's view on that. Tyler, I was going to actually ask you to build on this education element about the fact that you are an educator in multiple respects also through your blog, Marginal Revolution and Marginal Revolution University, et cetera, and some vision there. But maybe you just give -- maybe you can give a 1-minute response, and I'll get the same from Jean and Tharman on basic income, because I think that's something where a lot of people are interested in the topic, and there's some very differing views from different sides on whether it's a good idea or not. What's your kind of 30-second to 60-second take on universal basic income?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: My country does not have the politics to support it. And since our politics seems to be getting worse, there's a lot of potential policy improvements I'm not optimistic about.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: In an ideal word, would you think it's an experiment worth taking?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: I would like to see it tried first in countries like New Zealand and Denmark and see how it goes. I think we don't know. Doing it small scale we know works, but large scale, when all the norms change, we don't know.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Jean, what do you think about this topic, particularly around automation in China?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. I would just give you an example. There's a young miner in our platform, he's a driver, and he has a rock 'n roll dream, but he works as a miner in Xiangxi province. And because his income keeps dropping every month, so he started to become our driver so that he can drive around during daytime and also play rock 'n roll. He has a band. His dream is to come to Beijing. So that's what we're trying to do here. We provide a second income to people like that, and he is actually a 5-star driver, so he's very good, he's on top of our driver list. So that's one example. We have many thousands, millions of examples like this. We are providing major or second income to a lot of people. There are 17 million drivers getting income from our platform last year. Among all of them, 4 million are retired, laid-off workers from coal miners, steelmakers or veteran. So this is what we're trying to do. And back to the -- the AI, because I think the origination of this topic is about AI and whether it will replace people's job. I think, first of all, we all understand that technology will deeply transform people's lives in many ways, and it's inevitable. But all we're here, I understand, is trying to figure out how do we face it and what's the decision we are going to make. But for our industry, the AI is intelligence driving, and it's already here, assisted parking is part of it, right? It's to make driving more safely. And back to the base income point, my view is we need to look at what's the potential market. That's why I talked about the private car ownership. We have a huge incremental market there that good human service is always needed. So that's the relationship here. So the existing part will be provided by human, good human drivers and incremental part is to make driving safer.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Right. Yes. And I think that, that's a really important point when we talk about AI and automation is that the benefits of that are not cost-saving benefits, they're lives saved. That's time that can be devoted to more productive activities. Tharman, on basic income.</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Well, I think in all previous waves of technological innovation, going back 200 years or even the last 50 years, the jobs that were displaced have been more than made up for by new jobs being created, typically in a different sector, but sometimes in the same sector. The question is whether this time it will be different. And to be honest, we don't know the answer to that. We don't know whether 20 or 25 years from now, intelligent machines and big data would have replaced more jobs than we are able to recreate to meet new demands. We just don't the answer to that. But what we do between now and then will also shape the answer. If we introduce something like universal basic income soon, in preparation for a day which may not come where there's not enough jobs, if we introduce it soon, we are more likely to end up in a situation where we don't have enough jobs for people. Now this may seem a little paradoxical, but the basic impulse in public policy has to be from now until -- now right through the next 1.5 decades, at least, to get as many people into jobs as possible, not to make it more comfortable for them to be out of a job, it has to be to get them into jobs. And the fact is the jobs are available. In every economy in the world, jobs are not being filled because of a lack of skills. Even in the United States, there are very large numbers of jobs that are going unfilled because of the lack of basic skills, middle skills, and, of course, the higher-end skills. So that has to be our emphasis. If we make it too easy now for people to not have to get themselves trained and we make it too easy on local politicians and entrepreneurs to not put some effort into training people up. We are more likely to end up in a situation 20, 25 years from now where, indeed, people are less employable. So I'd say concentrate on the task we have from now until the next 20 years, and we are more likely then to end up in a situation where we do not have this very dire social vision of where there's just not enough jobs for people.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Very good. In the 5 minutes we have left, and unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity to bring in the audience. But I know that this is a conversation that will continue and is continuing throughout this conference in all the other sessions. I'd like to ask each of you on the panel to bring it home to those of us who are lucky enough to be here in Dalian, keeping in mind the fact that we are incredibly privileged and yet operating on behalf of not only stakeholders in developing economies who don't have anywhere near the ability to attend a World Economic Forum conference or meeting like this, but also on behalf of future generations that will inherit the resource management and policies in societies that we are creating today. With that in mind, what do we do? What do we -- how do we energize ourselves individually in our daily lives, leaving here today going back to real life and the mass of e-mails that has stacked up over 3 days and think how can we make the technologies we work with, the organizations we work in more inclusive, create that positive social benefit, that community action that Tharman talked about. Maybe I'll start with you, Marc, because as one of the biggest proponents of the stakeholder theory that I know and a great supporter of ours, you've had many ideas. But what's your call to action for the audience here in Dalian?</p><p><person><nameText>MARC R. BENIOFF</nameText></person>: Well, I kind of touched on it, which is, I mean, I can tell you what I'm doing, which is that I think that we all need to double down on our commitment to equality. I think that, just kind of touching on what Nick said, the World Economic Forum itself was built on this concept that companies need to be focused not just on their shareholders, but on their stakeholders. This idea of stakeholder theory, pioneered by Professor Klaus Schwab, the Executive Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum, is why we are all here. And stakeholder theory at its core, I think, is a theory about equality, that we, the leaders of society, have an obligation to look out for those who are less fortunate, whether they are the less educated or those who are being discriminated against or those had -- that have some type of situation that prevents them from having, and I'll come back to the topic title, inclusive growth. We need to include everybody. And I think that if we get focused on that and create the platforms to do that, we will continue to have and we'll have the best levels of success that we can.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Tyler, what's your call to action?</p><p>TYLER COWEN: I have simple advice, mostly for Americans. Stay open to China. How will we solve our digital divide? We will do it with super cheap Chinese smartphones. Who will make a lot of the future advances in biomedicine, in drones? WhatsApp is already better -- it's like an operating system. It's better than anything the United States has. We are still underestimating the innovation potential from China. For a very few voters or even intellectuals or think tanks, is openness to China a major issue? So that's my call to action. We can do it. We don't have to solve all the problems with education, though I would love to do that, too, health care and so one, but yes, simply, keeping good relations with China is actually #1 on my agenda for inclusivity, in addition to world peace.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Jean?</p><p>JEAN LIU: Sure. Well, I'm not going to comment on that. I will start my own one. Well, as I talked about, being inclusive means inclusive of taxi drivers. Actually, we provide 3 million rides on a daily basis to taxi drivers for free. We don't charge anything, and we also provide [very sweet] functions to help them locate restaurants and even toilets at a very good location. So we work with these people a lot, and I hope everyone, when you go home and when you take the taxi ride, please be very nice and thank them for their hard work. And also if you have a private car, try to share it once a week.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Perfect. Thank you. Tharman.</p><p>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM: Tyler's point was directed at the United States. Let me make the point in another way, which is that what happens here, in this part of China, Dalian, the Northeast or what they call the Dongbei region, is going to tell us a lot about the solutions for the future across the world. Look at the city, highly international, both by heritage as well as the nature of its current economy. Highly innovative, they have one of the most advanced IT parks. They are innovative society, plugged in with the world, but highly innovative. But they're part of a region in North China with an enormous rustbelt, middle-aged workers facing the risk of displacement, and the numbers are not small. The difference is every -- I've been here in Dalian for -- I first came about 15 years ago, I've been here several times since. It impresses me every time I come, but the problems of the region have grown larger, like they have in the Midwest in the United States or anywhere else. But the difference is everyone I speak to in national leadership and in local leadership, not a single one of them thinks that the answer is to find some ways of curbing external competition, not a single one of them thinks that the answer is to slow down innovation and have less disruption. The answer in their minds is in social and economic policies to help those who are displaced to get back into a job or to have a decent social safety net if they are in the older age group. Journey ahead is still daunting, but they have the right policy ideas. They're free of illusions. They have some resources. And I think if there's a place in the world that will show us the way forward, it will be somewhere here.</p><p>NICHOLAS DAVIS: Thank you, Tharman. And before I more formally thank our 4 speakers in what has been an excellent panel this afternoon, I want to just say 2 quick things. The first is to echo Murat's comments, which is to say please do engage with us on this topic and come to San Francisco, join our communities and engage deeply in this discussion and further work on projects, very specifically on technology or on domains like oceans, which we work on with Marc and others out of the San Francisco center, because this is an important enough topic for the future that I think we really need to put that dynamism ourselves into it. And the second point is just an offer to you. In 2016, Professor Schwab published his book, the 4th Industrial Revolution. There is a draft follow-up copy here, which will be available at the back of the room as you leave. There's also a PDF version on top link. The reason I show it is because it's in draft format so that you can tell us what else should be in here about the way that values and principles can improve the technologies that we're building and benefits all the lives of the stakeholders that we work on behalf of around the world. And with that, thank you for being a wonderful supportive audience, and thank you to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, Jean Liu, Marc Benioff and my good friend, Tyler Cowen. Thank you very much everyone.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Thank you so much for being here on our panel where we're going to talk about technology innovations in health care. I hope everyone's been having a great JPMorgan so far. And I know this is a lunchtime panel. So if you do have sandwiches or anything else, go for it. We want to make sure you guys have enough food.</p><p>So I'm Christina Farr. I'm a health and technology reporter with CNBC, and I'm just going to let the panel introduce themselves, the 10 seconds, on who you are and who you work for.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, COLOR GENOMICS, INC.: I'm Othman Laraki. I'm Cofounder and CEO of Color. We're a health technology company that works with about 100 different institutions across -- from NIH, self-insured employers, some -- pharma as well.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR, GLOBAL HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS: Aashima Gupta. I lead Healthcare Solutions in Google Cloud. In my role, I work with broad spectrum of industry stakeholders in helping them transform, leveraging cloud, APIs and AI. Happy to be here.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Jujhar. I'm responsible for the Salesforce, Industry Clouds. We are focused on building industry verticals for 7 of those industries and excited to be part of this panel, look forward to it.</p><p>KEN EHLERT, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF OFFICE OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED: Ken Ehlert. I'm UnitedHealth Group's Chief Scientific Officer. We spend all of our time in health care.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP, GLOBAL HEAD OF DIGITAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT &amp; LICENSING: Jeremy Sohn. I'm Global Head of Digital Business Development, which effectively is our partnership engine as well as our venture investment engine for working with technology, data and new business model companies. And hopefully, everyone knows what Novartis is, and we, too, spend all of our time in health care.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Here you go. So we are here to talk about health care, but we're also here to talk about technology. And everybody on this panel has a background in that, some more than others. Aashima Gupta, and then we have Salesforce and traditional health care companies also.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: But I wanted to kick things off with a question that kind of put you guys on the spot. And that's how do you define digital health? And is that even the right term? Should we say health tech? Is it health IT? Like what's your working definition that you use in and around kind of this conference?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Anyone want to start? I can jump in. I mean, basically, that's just health care. I think there's no version of health care with IT anymore. And so in the same way that like retail, 20 years ago, we were thinking about e-commerce versus the -- versus retail, but now it's like it seems completely inaccurate as to even think about retail without digital shopping, and I think health care is basically the same thing.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: Yes. I would say it's an intersection of traditional health care with technology, and it's all coming together. To me, that's digital healthy -- melting pots of technology and health care coming together.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I think the way we define it is technology kind of ushering health care into a much more retail-centric world with patient right at the center. That's how we look at it. That's what the whole company is all about, and that's how we define digital health.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: For us, it actually would depend on which part of health we're talking about. So if we're automating core business processes, that would be one version. But if we're moving into a different way of diagnosing and screening patients, that would be another way that we'd think about it. Or on the extreme, from a therapy perspective, if we're thinking about beyond conditions that we think of as body type conditions. But if we move to the mind, the ability of a molecule to cross into the brain to actually alter an underlying PTSD event, for example, that's a -- today, with current technology, that's an impossible task. But using digital mechanisms, we can actually go in and sort of mitigate the effects of that. So I think it depends on what part of health we're actually talking about. Whether it's the business or all the way to the other extreme, it's in therapy itself. Those types of tools that are there, the tools that are out there and available can be deployed against those things in different ways.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: So I love the fact that you asked that question because I think what you're hearing is, is that digital health probably means something different to everyone.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Absolutely. Yes.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: At the same time, what I hope is, is that we actually ultimately drop the initial adjective and we just actually talk about it as health.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Health.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: And I think that that's sort of the transition, in fact, the inflection point that we're in. And a lot of what we were trying to do and the fact that we want to -- I sit within our digital office. And the reality is, is digital -- why do we even need a digital office? Ultimately, I'm trying to apply technology and innovation and new business models as a core capability inside every aspect of my core business, whether in research or development or running clinical trials or my commercial organization, or for that matter, internal finance, et cetera. All those are business units that exist and don't really need to be replaced. So what we're trying to do is to just create an agility engine inside of those around health care. And so in many respects, it's all just health and just -- it's how we run our business.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. I mean, I want to kind of -- a couple of people said that they think digital health should eventually just be health, but we do see -- maybe it's because we're in a transition period, but there is certainly a difference in the culture between health care companies and technology companies. I mean, one of the great sort of mantras that's kicked about in Silicon Valley is move fast and break things. And can you imagine if I walked into a UnitedHealthcare or Novartis and said, \"I want to move -- I want to break things.\" You guys would say, \"Okay, here's the door.\" So how do you bring together those 2 cultures? And what do we kind of need to learn from each other to get these conversations to be more productive?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: Maybe I can start. So from a Novartis perspective and from a pharma perspective, certainly quality is -- and repeatability is one of those things that we absolutely believe is core to one of our strengths, right? We're best in class in science and in delivering transformative drugs for our patients because of that quality, because of that excellence. But at the same time, when you talk about digital health, for us, again, it's building a new muscle. And that muscle is that quality or being best in class actually isn't about repeatability. It's about continuous optimization. And so that's a little bit of taking that start-up engine, that technology engine and actually recreating the way that we operate. And in fact, we do that in the science, right, but we don't necessarily do that across all of our business functions.</p><p>So I actually don't think about it as breaking Novartis or pharma or large companies in general. It's actually just creating a different way of operating and hopefully a more optimal way of operating.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I think at Salesforce, we actually see the perspective of both the universes, the B2B as well as the B2C, the consumer as well as the enterprise. And we don't believe that you can't be agile and still be maintaining the change management processes. We have done it successfully across multiple of our industries. Health care is no different. We believe the changes that actually you need to bring on the enterprise side of the house, they are actually going to be really pushing the digital health concept, touching the consumer. The whole patient engagement is going to be very fundamentally driven by the internal processes that change on the enterprise side of the house. So we see them mutually feeding on one another rather than being exclusive. And successfully, we've done it. We do agile releases 3 times a year. We've done it for the last 20 years, both with enterprise as well as the consumers.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: I think one of the cultural gaps that has existed sometimes is that if you're purely coming from a consumer technology world, I used to be at Google for a number of years. And when you're iterating sometimes on a pure consumer product, there are very few parts of the product that are sacrosanct, in some sense, where you can iterate on the entire experience. As you can -- there's a big surface area where you can be very experimental. And I think with health care, obviously, there is some parts that are very deeply sacred in terms of ensuring that you don't cause harm, that you have certain quality standards, et cetera. And I think sometimes where there has been kind of a gap in that cultural -- in those cultural norms has been around different assumptions about where -- what parts are experimental versus not. Like, for example, just with Color's experience like we...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Can you give us an example?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Yes. I was going to say, like, for example, with Color, so we -- by now we've built a kind of an infrastructure that has been used to roll out the largest number of genomics -- population genomics programs in the world. And there are some parts of the system that we are very experimental with, like, for example, how do you get a clean consent flows and how do you get people to answer questions with the highest convenience for them, et cetera. Those are things where you actually want to increase yield and be very experimental.</p><p>On the flip side, we run a clinical-grade diagnostic part of the product. And that is a part where we really cannot mess up, right? And it's very -- like the experimentation framework for that is very constrained. And so I think like that's where like sometimes if you come in with a pure consumer tech hat, it's important to realize, like, okay, where do I draw the lines and operate in these very different worlds and be kind of comfortable with them.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: So you're saying you can have pieces of the business that operate more like traditional health care and then pieces where you've got R&amp;D efforts internally that feel more like a traditional tech company?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: Yes. I understand that there's just a curve of risk tolerance and impact across your product. I think we're -- which I think is much less the case in consumer products. I mean when -- if Twitter goes down, it's not great. They lose money, but they always say, no one dies, right? Like whereas in health care, that actually is not true. So I think that's really understanding -- like being sensitive to that difference, I think, is important.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: Yes. And I think where I sit today, when we were working with the industry stakeholders, one comment that was made just a couple of days ago that, \"Aashima, we -- yes, we move very slow, but we make much less mistakes.\" And so -- and now they're shifting. There's a paradigm shift. And if I go back to my old role in Kaiser Permanente, I led digital health incubations. This was a completely different team. You incubate ideas before you actually roll it out in pilot or production. So there is that discipline. Things are changing. I think the health care industry is now looking into -- another term that is overused in health care, or in general, in all the industries, digital transformation. Just like digital health, everything is about digital transformation now. It's such a generic term. Like are you transforming clinician experience, physician experience? What does...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. What does it mean to transform something digitally?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: Right. So it's -- and there are many aspects, just patient facing, physician facing, and there's actually operation robotic process automation. And that's an ?ber term of umbrella people call digital transformation, yes.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: To this point about culture, I mean, I've even -- I think in this space where we are still quite confused about what digital health means, I've had folks tell me Peloton is a digital health company, and you guys may agree or disagree with that. But people say that digital health companies, in general, tend to focus more on sort of the very privileged populations and often as a cash pay aspect. You see them kind of on the fringes of health care. And some might say, \"Well, that's not the case because you're also seeing digital health companies actually work with traditional health insurers and pharma and others.\" But do you see there being any truth to that that digital health, so far, has primarily been concerned with the wellness, the fitness, the sort of higher-income professional user base?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: We see a lot that's out there, and it's true. There are a lot of companies, especially from something that feels very consumer-like. I want to do a diet. I want to exercise more. And it makes sense that some -- a company that's doing that would take the perspective that I have a consumer that's purchasing something from me, I'm trying to optimize the experience, the product for that consumer, and there is a price that they're willing to exchange value on. That part is separate, though, from is it health or not health. Yes, exercising is health. When we all stand up and walk out of here, our large muscle groups are going to start producing interleukins, and they're going to have an anti-inflammatory effect. And none of you got permission from your health -- actually, probably a bunch of you have health insurance from UnitedHealthcare, but none of you got permission from your insurance company to actually engage in health like that, and yet you do. So this idea of what's health and what's not, we're human, we're alive, and every interaction that we do is part of health. When you have an interaction that's a social interaction with somebody, that actually changes what's going on in your brain. If you socially isolate, you will put your brain under enormous amounts of stress. That will cause your immune -- as it goes through all the different sort of the HPA axis all the way down, that will cause your immune system to start responding in a different way. Do I want you to start exercising when that happens? Sure, I do. But the idea that that's all in one bucket and this stuff is in a different bucket is actually not quite true.</p><p>So like this morning, just on our call, we talked about -- I don't know, it's about 0.5 million lives that are in the Motion program, where they're actually earning really large incentives, about $1,000 -- up to $1,000 a year for doing something as simple as actually going for a walk, and I could take that a lot further if we wanted to. The idea that you have a molecule -- and by the way, the idea that like health care companies don't move quick or innovate, thousands of molecules will get tested to produce something that actually doesn't kill people in the process of helping them. The same thing could be said when you're looking at a genomic test. There's enormous amounts of stuff that's going on there. But when you start to narrow down and say, \"Hey, we've got 0.5 million people that are actually doing things for their health, incorporating it in, reaping the benefit of that that's a pretty cool thing to have happen.\" When somebody makes a molecule or some sort of a protein, whatever it might be that you need to take to improve your health, you got to remember, you still need to take that pill or you need to get that injection. That, too, is part of health. And how we make that happen, whether it's with incentives or it's with an app that actually can work with somebody to actually get that going, all of those things end up being in scope.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I would say kind of to your point, that there are 2 universes, right, in the digital health are kind of the rich and the privileged and the others. I believe that a lot of the insurance companies are actually investing. UnitedHealth, for example, acquired Vivify very recently for the remote monitoring piece. They are giving incentives for people because I think at the heart of all of this digital health is bringing the consumer into mediating and managing their own health. And all the insurance -- UnitedHealth and all other companies like that are focused on outcomes. So if the result is a better outcome, I think it's not a matter of just a subsection of the population using it, it's the whole institution is using for better outcomes. So I would say those 2 universes are very much in tandem with one another.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: So I have a question for the audience, if I may. So how many digital health apps do you think exists in different app stores? There's an app for diabetes, losing weight, blood pressure. Like any guesses? It could be Play or the other app store.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Thousands.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: Thousands, like...</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: Tens of thousands.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: So the last I checked, this was like, 250,000-plus apps. Just -- there's an app for everything. Now my follow-on question, which is the crux of my point, how many of those apps actually connect to your medical record, percentage guess? Like 2%. Okay. So to me, when we are creating this app ecosystem and digital health innovations and if you don't meaningfully connect that to a patient's medical records, that all becomes a very scattered data, and I think that's my view on the digital health. It needs to be connected for patients and including the medical record.</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: I don't know if that's the right even metric of like defining as something being related to health because, in reality, I think there's like 3 different things that kind of get mixed when we're thinking about this. Like the first is that health that goes all the way from a basic human right to a luxury item, right? Like there's basic human right that if you're having a heart attack, someone should try to save you, all the way to going to a spa in the Swiss Alps, and that's a luxury item that's good for health. I think that's one dimension to it.</p><p>I think the second dimension is that the -- there is a component of technology that tends to correlate also with luxury. So you get the newest iPhone, if you're wealthier, et cetera. And so we tend to associate access to technology with kind of affluence.</p><p>But the third effect that I think is more important than the first 2 is that technology, historically, and I think, especially for health, is also a democratizer of access to services and products. And so like, I think, actually, like, over time, that's the way in which, really, we serve a lot of people much more effectively. So -- and so the -- like...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: I actually want to pick on you a little bit there because you guys transitioned the business. When I first started reporting on Color, it was very much a cash business. And now it's -- you connect with a lot of insurance companies. So was that transition about trying to make the company less about serving the fortunate few?</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: It's actually interesting because it's -- initially, even the reason why we actually have a cash access is that we took a product that used to cost $5,000 and put a clinical-grade version of it at $250, which is still not nothing. But it made it much more accessible, right? And then -- but the -- but really, where we started working with payers, et cetera, is much more in terms of recognizing that there's not just one stakeholder in health care, right? Like it's kind of like there's individual, there's payers and the clinicians and really kind of incorporating those 3 together in the model, both from a product as well as a business model.</p><p>And it's been actually pretty been part of kind of how we've been working for quite a while. So like the kind of cash access is really about an access point for people, but -- yes.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: So I actually want to -- while we're on the topic of interoperability, which I think Aashima hinted that here with the 2% of apps that are connected into the medical record. So I write about digital health companies. I talk to them all the time, and they would love to be connected to the medical record. But there's all sorts of information blocking. It's not easy within the health care industry. Are we going to see movement on that this year because every year at JPMorgan, someone says -- someone gets up and says, \"I just don't have -- I'm a patient. I don't have access to my medical record.\" And you -- we have the same discussions, and it doesn't seem to change. So who's got some optimism from me on that front?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: I didn't hear Aashima what was keynote, but I'm very hopeful that, in 2020, the information blocking rule will be passed. I think I'm very hopeful for that, but that's the crux of the problem that we see as a patient. I think it's more relatable as a consumer. If you go to your primary care physician and you're looking for some tests from your specialist, that information is not there, and that's the reality. And unless we fix that interoperability problem, the digital health ecosystem will just become the shells of applications with incomplete patient information. And digital health is also about behavior change, right? So that needs motivation, ability, trigger and connecting those different silos, and I think I'm hopeful. But the progress has been slow, but 2020 is the year.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So I am going to take maybe a more optimistic perspective on this. I mean if you think about some of the challenges that sort of persisted inside the ecosystem that prevented that from happening. First, the plumbing didn't exist. So the capability to actually -- first, most of the data actually wasn't even digitized. So that's only happened in the last decade. Now that the data was digitized, the second thing was that you needed to standardize and normalize. And now we have standards. Whether it's -- largely FHIR, but there are other important standards that exist that now allow that data interoperability.</p><p>The thing that you need after that effectively is the company is operating in a way that they allow that data to actually flow in a liquid way, and that's happening at multiple levels. It's happening both at the commercial level, and there are meaningful discussions, both at the policy level as well, to make that much more of a -- I don't want to say a mandate, but it will be something that I think that the clarity in terms of the importance and the fluidity of that data will exist. And there are companies that do exist now to allow and enable an individual to aggregate and collect in a more meaningful way his or her own data.</p><p>The piece that's, honestly, is still missing is the demand from the individual. Now there are people who absolutely want and need their data, and that's beginning to emerge. And unfortunately, those situations tend to be rare diseases and so on and so forth. And those are terrible situations, and thank god that these changes and evolutions are happening. But what we need is to create the applications that create value for me as a consumer of that data that will drive the use cases. And so I think we're just in the beginning of that inflection point, whether it's clinical decision support systems or more recreational use in some of these health and wellness apps that you're talking about. But that will certainly evolve, and it is evolving.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I'm highly optimistic that the interoperability will move big -- in a big way in this year. And the reasons are -- I actually slightly differ. I believe, actually, the whole focus on patient experience is going to be the biggest driver for change. It's going to push -- whether they are providers, whether they are payers or pharma, it's going to push the needle because they need systems which talk to one another to have a great consumer experience. So that's one part of it.</p><p>Secondly, I think the regulations and the whole industry actually betting on standards. The 21st Century Cures Act is a big initiative in that regard. But even the interoperability pledge that a lot of the top tech companies have taken is also making a concerted attempt into focusing on those foundations of interoperability. I think gone are the days when people think about just products. It's much more about ecosystems. And if those are to thrive, interoperability has to happen. So consumer is going to make the change.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I'll be super optimistic. We've actually pulled in all the heterogeneous sets for all of the folks that we've served, run it through -- in ontology so that we can homogenize some of the pieces. And it is available, and it's available down to a subset of those who -- those members. We're doing pretty careful staged roll out and watching how people use it and what they use -- what those things look like. That set is also available for other outside partners, parties to come in and actually use, subject to sort of the use rules around what we should be able to use it for.</p><p>The data blocking thing, it is frustrating, especially when you sit back and you don't really think about what's happening. If I said to you, \"Hey, Chrissy, we're going to expose all of your notes from every conversation that you have with everybody in a public way.\" You'd probably retract from that quite a bit. And you might even go to the point of saying, \"I think I'm not going to keep my notes very carefully anymore.\"</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. I'd be burning them in a fire.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So you could see why a doctor or a health system, somebody would say, \"I'm not so sure I like that idea.\" Now there are other things that can be done. We've looked at claim and different types of disease states and do you need breadth of data, meaning everything that's going on? Or do you need depth of data? If you're in the ICU, depth of data turns out as super important. If you have a chronic condition and you're running around not hitting the hospital, turns out breadth of data is way more important.</p><p>Now if you're running around, we're trying to think about sort of how to help you and how to engage, do I need to be able to have every single doctor note available and posted up for any vendor that comes to look at it? And the answer is probably no. In fact, actually, I would -- I bet all of us would be uncomfortable with that idea.</p><p>Right now, I'm in a camp where I would rather that -- I don't like data blocking, but that's a really big term that captures a whole bunch of different circumstances underneath it. The idea that you can't get access to anything, that seems problematic. The idea that you can't get access to everything, that doesn't seem problematic. It feels like if I got a patient in the ICU, I don't want to have whoever is creating that note to have a restriction in their own mind about. I don't want to write something down.</p><p>So -- and when we look across -- we've got about 50,000 or so physicians that are practicing in real exam rooms all over the place. So it's not -- everybody here knows that. But it's not just an insurance company there. There's all these doctors that are doing those things, too, and they have to think about those issues. And I think we actually owe those types of folks a little bit of deference in terms of what are they doing to practice and to -- and with all respect to the -- it's like a consumer industry. This little device right here doesn't change very fast either. The software on it does change. But in health care, every interaction between a physician and a patient is a unique opportunity for a unique decision to be made. There are millions, if not billions, of experiments going on because you're at the edge of what we know from a science perspective. That's why some of the stuff that's happening at Color is actually really important for where the world is going to. This idea that change happens, figuring out how to capture that and then deploy it in a way that helps is the real issue.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: Yes. I think...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Go ahead.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I just wanted to comment on one thing about information blocking, right? A very pertinent point about what does get exposed. But I think when I was talking about the legislations and how they are morphing also, we are talking about information blocking, but ONC is now also chartered with the target of what are the things that are not information blocking. So that actually shows the realization that there are things which are information blocking and which are not. So the process, at least from a legislation standpoint, has evolved to a point that all these nuances are actually getting factored in.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. I mean I was just going to -- I'll jump in, but we can come back to this, which would -- which is that I also talk to physicians about this idea of opening up their notes. And there's definitely fear among the physician community that they're going to write that a patient is obese or difficult and what if that patient sees the note and what would ensue there, and I think there is something extremely valid to that concern.</p><p>But I want to also kind of bring up the privacy issue as well at this juncture because it's been in the press. This is -- when you mentioned any large tech company, Google, Amazon, the next word that you will often hear is privacy. And this certainly has come up for Google lately with the Ascension partnership.</p><p>So I wanted to start with Aashima there and see if you had anything more to share about that and what you're thinking kind of at this point but then broaden it up to the panel to think about how we can weigh the sort of the privacy versus some of the utility that might come out of opening up access to this information.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: I'm glad you brought it up, Chrissy. From the Ascension work, we're very proud to be working with them. It is a long partnership with them. And if I look into what they're doing with us, it's no different than any other health system and health care companies who are coming to cloud to really migrate their data and with the intent to really gain analytics or build AI-enabled applications on top. So they are bringing digital to the cloud. It is private and secure environment for Ascension, and it's -- we have BAs with them. It's all protected. They have a key. They control the access.</p><p>The second project that we're working with them and other [videos] out there, it's intelligent layer on top. It's all EHR search, which is to really look into a patient's history. And if you're looking at the patient's notes, it's cut, copy, cut, copy. And it's -- there -- this tool would enable their clinician and nurses to really, a, define information they need from the vast history and then being able to get that at the point of care so that they can make the informed decisions. And again, the -- there is that skepticism around tech companies, but it is no different than people leveraging cloud, and we are modernizing their infrastructure. Like if you look into the TechCrunch report, which was 2 days ago, billions of DICOM images because the medical center storage was not secure. It's out there. It has PHI, right? That's news there.</p><p>So moving to cloud there, that's what essentially you should realize is that we need to modernize that layer, and they are doing this on-premise analytics and warehouse onto the cloud.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: So maybe just to state, hopefully, the obvious. I mean, from a pharma perspective, I mean, obviously, we hold patient identity and privacy as extremely important. And maybe the industry itself, the broader health care industry can learn from some of the models that we have, which are good and bad in many respects. They're limiting and -- but they're also empowering. So we, by nature, we have an informed consent process. We don't necessarily need to implement it in the same way, but that's the challenge, right? Because the reality is, is when you ask the vast majority of people, would they contribute their data, their personal data for research purposes, and in particular, for health care, the vast majority of people say, yes, right? And so it's really just a transparency and an ordering process of instead of finding out that your data is actually being used for research after the fact, let's just ask for that up-front. So I think it's that change, that shift that really needs to happen, and we do that, thankfully, already for good reasons inside the pharma industry. And hopefully, the rest of the health care market will catch up.</p><p>I do think it's equally important for all of us to recognize that the evolution of technology and the vast amount of data that's being aggregated and the ability to actually do pattern recognition means that also the ocean of identity and privacy is also going to be changing. And so beyond even that consent, I think we have to think about those things differently. What is PHI? What is identity? What is privacy?</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: What's it mean to be de-identified?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: Or to be even de-identified, exactly. And certainly, as we look at multi-omic imprints, but not even that. I mean if I go to the same -- if you look at completely de-identified sort of data sets associated with, well, maybe not me and work because I'm in a different city every day. But like for most people, I mean, you could pretty much map out in a completely de-identified data set that that's Jeremy Sohn, right, or that's you. And so identity means to me...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: That's kind of terrifying, right, just to mention that.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: Yes. It's terrifying. It's terrifying. So the trust relationship, maybe the transparency needs to shift to transparency in terms of what are you doing with that data? How do I know -- how do I actually get visibility to where my data is flowing and how it's being used. And then we can then think about, all right, how do I now sort of create limitations around the edges of that use because that's super hard.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: That capacity can go both ways, right? Like, because now you also have the ability to know what is being done with your data and much more so than it ever was possible before. So I totally agree with Jeremy about the -- at least what we've seen is like over 80% in clinical care context, people actually are very willing to contribute honestly to research, especially when they -- when it's made up-front. And the -- but I think the...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Can I make a point to you? I would be willing -- just personally would be willing to share a lot of my health information with different entities up here, but I would not be willing to share it with you because of the loophole with how -- maybe -- but because of the -- because of GINA and the law against genetic discrimination doesn't cover long-term care, life insurance and disability. So for me, I just -- I don't see the regulations protecting me as a consumer to make it sort of worth my while to give you my genetic information, if it could be used against me.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: So I think that's an interesting point. Like, I mean, that's -- I think there's -- and fundamentally, one thing to realize is that those are limitations in our kind of current like legal framework, not -- they're not connected to the actual technology in itself, right? When all is said and done, all that genetics does is that it's a way to generate a high amount of signal that can be used for your health. And now we're at a point where that signal can be used in a life-saving fashion, right? The ability to control the use of our data and to stop it from being misused, I think that is something that is fundamental to kind of like the trust relationship that, not just like in genetics, but through all of health care, is part of the contract, right. Like the -- that's what the ACA had a very big impact on that in terms of like preexisting conditions, et cetera. But I think that's actually a part of the long arc of data's relationship with health care.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: I think that's where the...</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: Sorry, I just want to make one slight joke, but we should ask Ken because my guess is your genetic information is going to be interesting but less informative than probably de-identified data on what you ate, where you went, how often you sleep...</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Amazon probably has that.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: So on and so forth in terms of your potential cost to the health care system or who you're friends with.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I'm just going to stay silent on this one.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: I was going to say the work that Kevin aligns and the different industry groups are proposing and doing around consumer-directed data exchange because to your point, you should have that right to share and maybe not of Color, maybe with the other entities. So that choice is with consumer, but that consumer-directed exchanges are still -- sometimes is growing. And good work being done by Kevin and a few others to push that ball forward.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: From a Salesforce perspective, from our perspective, trust is the highest value. So privacy, as was mentioned, informed consent, I think that should be the bedrock of privacy. The consumer should know where the data is, how is it getting used. It should be nondiscriminatory. At the same time, all the time understanding and getting educated on the whole process of how it is getting used is extremely important.</p><p>One point I would mention, the ability to revoke after having given data because there are certain discussions that are happening. \"Hey, once we have given the data, we want to actually use it, and it's very valuable.\" I think the revocation piece is extremely important.</p><p>I think one other part is I think technology is improving enough that there was a point about anonymized data. You still can point to things pointing back to that individual. I think with the advances in technology, we can actually build the foundation that the anonymized data at least remains, for all intents and purposes, anonymized.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Any thoughts from the insurance perspective?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: There is nothing more to beat up on this topic. It's -- well, actually, there is a small piece. Trust with data, it is an important thing. Consumer trust is one thing. In health, trust takes on a new dimension that I think is important to appreciate. One of the things that you need to trust is that the information that you're getting is accurate. So if I do a search on something and I brought something back if that's ordered by who's sponsored an ad or whatever. And I'm not making a knock on a business model at all. But if the things are at the top, are those ad sponsored? Or are those the things that really are going to be most helpful to me and what I'm doing. In health, that actually takes on in very real ways, life and death type situations. So to take a really easy answer or a really easy situation. if you take out -- on an annual basis, we have about 1.6 million, 1.7 million cancer -- can really diagnose cancer cases. And in the example, I apologize because I guarantee I'm going to touch on somebody's personal situation in the room. But if we take out the top 4: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, that leaves about half the cases left. In the rest of the cases, you max out at about 20,000 cases a year. We have 10,000 medical oncologists in this country. And all the rocket scientists in the room will really quickly go that's an average of 2 cases per oncologist per year. In reality, you have some that only see a case like that one every other year or every third year. On the other extreme, you have some people who kind of specialize in that type of case. But when cancer happens to you, almost always, it only happens once. And so the idea that I need to talk to somebody right now to figure out not just what type of cancer I have, I got to get back all the way up to who should I go see. I could do a Google search and say -- or any other search engine. But since you have 90% share, we'll go with that. You could do a Google search and say, \"Okay. Show me oncologists close by me.\" But if the oncologist close by you has only seen a case like once last year, that's not a good oncologist to have implementing a brand new cutting-edge therapy that just came out, that might have serious consequences to it. Or do you go talk to your primary care physician? Or do you go to your social media network and say, \"Hey, I have cancer. Where should I go?\" And then somebody responds with, \"Well, my uncle had prostate cancer, and so you should go here.\" Not even thinking about prostate cancer, it's almost always with the urologist. And maybe you have lung cancer, and that's, by the way, different organ systems.</p><p>So the idea that that information is being used to guide what happens next to you is an element of trust that we don't talk about very often. We talk about -- I need to trust that -- I mean, we have data with Google. It sits in there. It's protected. It would be like the world's largest lawsuit if that protective lock-and-key data became unlocked. That's not going to happen. We have stuff with Salesforce. The same thing. It's not going to happen. We have business-to-business trust that they're actually protecting the data. But that next level when the patient calls up, which, by the way, is one of the most frequent phone calls we get, I have a serious condition. Where do I go? Now there's a new level of trust that's actually necessary in that transaction about what happens next.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. Great point. So I wanted to kind of raise another issue about something that seems fairly unique to me about health care, which is that I have colleagues that cover other areas like education technology, and fintech is another one. And in the course of the past 10 years of their reporting, you've seen so much infiltration of disruptive technology into the space, and it's really moved in leaps and bounds. But with my sector, it seems to be much slower, much harder. There's a lot more failure. I mean, not to pick on Google, but Google Health didn't work. We had -- Microsoft HealthVault just shut down. It hasn't been an easy road. So would anybody comment on just is health care more challenging? And is that a good thing because you're talking -- unlike fintech, I mean, it's certainly important, but lives aren't at stake in the same way.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: Let me take a first crack at it. I think the point about Microsoft Health or Google Health kind of not getting the same amount of traction was fundamentally focused on the fact that they were relying on the patient actually collecting all the data. Fundamentally, that was -- now if you compare it with Apple, the way they are trying to do it, it is -- they are mediating across different EHRs getting that information, the success is much higher.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Is anybody in the room, by the way, using Apple Health records to access their health information?</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: It's a small number, reinforces my point. There aren't use cases yet for it.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Check this out. though. Is anybody in the room ever had a claim processed?</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: So I think there's a different angle to that from the complexity, Chrissy. Health care, again, having spent years in Kaiser Permanente, the health IT landscape is pretty complex. So it's not a big tech or a health care or start wave. There's an ecosystem problem to really push the needle forward. Now we talked about the trust from the consumer standpoint. Let me ask another query, again, to the audience. Let's say I'm a big health system. I'm really looking to reach out to my population for female aged 45 to 55 who have a BRCA1, BRCA2 gene , and I really want them to come back to get a mammogram done. And they have insurance, and the insurance allows for the test included. And I want to reach out to that population today. How many people think you can do that query today? Like you -- that's the internal. You have the systems, and it's not the vast information, but in the -- do you think how easy to do that query?</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Health systems allow or...</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: As a health system, for them to make that outreach to the patient population, to reach out to folks so that they can get the mammogram done, like screening, because your health information is in EHR, your membership system is completely -- and then your DICOM images are sitting in some PACS system. So today, the problem is all data silos are very much reality of health care. And I know we talk about standards, and there's that -- it's true that HL7 standards have done a phenomenal job, and FHIR is new and up and coming. But just because a new standard exists, do you think you can map your back-end system to the new standard? Is it magic? It's hard work. It takes years, mapping around thousands of fields for millions of patients with validation. It takes years for them to take that leap. These systems have been built for many, many decades in the past. And for them to take leap forward, it's very humbling. It's hard.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: Chrissy, I was trying to quote the example of Microsoft and Google, right? From a personal -- I think this circumstance was different. My belief is that the technology adoption in health care is definitely slower. If you look at telecommunications, they have digitized their whole processes. In case of health care, the silos are huge, and the focus on interoperability has been way slower. If those 2 things have changed, the adoption of all these new technologies should be as easy as in any other case. I think it's a matter of telecommunication. Their interoperability standards are equally important. You try to get a cell phone, changing it, making it easy, you can do everything online. Try doing that in health care. One silo doesn't talk to the other. That is at the heart.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. They use -- I mean you used to keep your phone number hostage, and now they don't. And in health care, I think we still think that we have to trap patients inside the health system and...</p><p>OTHMAN LARAKI: And also at a different phase of the digitization of the industry. Like, I mean, this actually, like right now, health care feels like the mobile industry felt in the early 2000s. And like, for example, now Vodafone was the product of, I think, like done dozens of acquisitions. And they still were running literally like 20 different billing systems internally. And so if you moved states, they could not like reconcile your bills, et cetera. So you have like very similar problems actually. And so I think just the -- I think health care is maybe just at a different part of the cycle. It's probably actually not even that more complex than telecoms in practice. It's probably just that we are kind of still in the earlier phase of ingesting technology and as a...</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: I think we need interoperability to be real. There's no dearth of ideas in health care. These ideas need execution, and those execution need doers, and those doers need tech to really make it happen. Like we talked about air mapping from [FHIR]. It's a pretty massive undertaking by itself. So what can we do to bring those tools together?</p><p>The -- one other example I was going to use was we talk about interoperability, and I've been saying that both as been before joining Google as Apigee in launching interoperability with Project Argonaut and then prior to that with Kaiser. Each year, we go to conferences. We say interoperability, and we sound innovative, but it has not moved. Right. We keep saying this word, but it really needs actions, doers, and doers need tech. And I think we need to be building those tools to help the health care industry to move forward.</p><p>JEREMY SOHN;NOVARTIS;VP: So I should preface this by saying I spend every day -- every minute of the day arguing that we can be faster, and we could be better, and it's just too slow. So I preface by saying that. But in a reality check, the statement that health care is not innovating in speed, I don't think is a fair comment for a whole host of reasons. I mean we could look at many examples.</p><p>I mean we are now in an age where we are curing disease. Started in hep C, and now we're doing it in cancer. And thank god for cell and gene therapy and many other next-generation technologies, technologies, not health care, technologies. We are literally eradicating certain forms of disease, unheard of.</p><p>15, 20 years ago, the health care system was all run on paper. You would go to the doctor's office, okay? You would -- they would take the file. They had carbon copies of your documentation. I mean that's how we ran clinical trials. And so the entire industry is now digitized. It hasn't been perfect because, as everyone has described, in some sense, we are in a 3-sided marketplace, a 4-sided marketplace, maybe even a 6-sided marketplace, and that absolutely creates challenges, right, challenges that are super frustrating, right, for -- I'm an entrepreneur, actually, before I came to Novartis. But the reality is that there's a tremendous amount of change, and I can keep going on.</p><p>In the third -- you made a point earlier, that may be sort of less second-world, third-world countries don't necessarily benefit from digital health. In fact, some of the most exciting opportunities are happening there. And we do a lot of our innovation work I think actually wrongly. We should be doing it in third-world countries or in smaller countries, but we should be doing it in both, in first-world countries and in developing countries. But why? Because we're in Ghana, and we are distributing life-saving medicine by drones. Think about that for a second. We're not doing that here yet, right, but we are absolutely beginning to do that in third-world countries because we can, right? In third-world countries, the infrastructure, it doesn't need to be replaced because it's being built. And so a lot of the frustration is the 6-sided marketplace and the established institutions. And that's a good thing, and it's a bad thing. But it's absolutely happening, and we should celebrate it, and we should continue to struggle through it and fight for making it faster.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I agree.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: I just have one element. The health care industry is innovating, right? Precision medicine. Color sitting right here is there. The fact is all the innovation is happening in the silos. The innovation from a patient experience is way behind as compared to other industries. I think that's the fundamental point. And those innovations are happening in those silos. As a result, the end consumer is actually not seeing the results of the connected system. That's at the heart of what fintech is doing much better. Because as part of my portfolio, I see them evolving across 7 different industries. That's a fundamental difference between health care and other industries.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: I don't think that's true.</p><p>JUJHAR SINGH;SALESFORCE;EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; GENERAL MANAGER. INDUSTRY CLOUDS: That's a good discussion then.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: The outcome -- when you think about the outcome and experiencing the outcome of innovation, today, we have people that live that yesterday, they died. That is an outcome that is pretty hard to put a dollar amount or an experience or anything else around. That's a pretty darn good experience. There are babies that are born today that, 15 years ago, didn't stand a chance of making it a week. Jeremy is right. Innovation is happening everywhere at a pace that is absolutely incredible.</p><p>This idea around information and how it flows, though, I think people who are outside look at it through a lens of the wrong analogy. I understand the analogy of like the telecom industry. That's sort of true but mostly not. It's more like -- because, see, in telecom, we all use our phones every single day, lots of times. We don't all go to the hospital and go to the ICU and hang out there every single day with a new rare disease. It happens once. It happens twice. So it happens whatever it is. It's a lot more like show me the really cool digital app that tracks all of your home purchases that you've made this year. There isn't an app that tracks all of your home purchases because there are only like 5 people on the planet that buy lots of homes in the same year. The reality in health is that these things are so skewed, you have a few people that have a very few -- I'll stop right there. I'll stop mid-sentence.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: I was going to let you wrap it up with...</p><p>KEN EHLERT: We'll bring it out in the hall and have a different conversation.</p><p>CHRISTINA FARR;CNBC; HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: We'll continue the conversation. Thank you so much to our panel. This is so much fun, and I love the discussion between all the different stakeholders today. So thank you very much.</p><p>KEN EHLERT: Thank you.</p><p>AASHIMA GUPTA;GOOGLE CLOUD;DIRECTOR: Thanks.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

The article talks about Salesforce's interest in creating a healthcare business and believe it can reach $1 billion in revenue. The article also highlights how SalesForce has recently hired over a dozen people from the healthcare and medical device sectors.</p><p><br/> Plus, they even talk about the roll out of the CareWeb Messenger product that is built on the top of Salesforce's technology:<br/> The University of California at San Francisco, for instance, rolled out CareWeb Messenger, built on top of Salesforce's technology, through which doctors, nurses and patients talk online and on mobile devices. UCSF and Salesforce have close ties: in April, CEO Marc Benioff donated $100 million to its children's hospital.<br/> I'll be interested to see how this first product plays out. It actually fits into Salesforce's core competencies quite well. Although, the secure healthcare messaging space is a crowded one. With that said, I was invited to a Salesforce event to talk about healthcare. Unfortunately, the timing was bad so I couldn't make it, but now I'm particularly interested in what was said at the event.<br/> It seems that sooner or later, all of the big tech companies come after healthcare. We've seen the same with Google, Microsoft, Dell, Apple, Samsung, and many more. While it must be incredibly enticing for these companies to come after a trillion dollar market like healthcare, most of these companies come into healthcare with an amazing amount of naivety as to the complexities of healthcare. Once they get in, they find these complexities and change their mind. We'll see if Salesforce does something similar.<br/> With that said, Salesforce has the money, the platform and the connections to do something in healthcare. Plus, I welcome fresh ideas and perspectives from companies like Salesforce in healthcare. I think that we all agree that there's a huge opportunity for technology to improve healthcare. I want as many people working on finding those solutions as possible. Doesn't hurt to have a multi-billion dollar company taking an interest in it as well.<br/> What do you think of Salesforce's entrance into healthcare? Will they be a major player? Where do you think it makes sense for them to focus their efforts?<br/> Some of the articles on this talk about Salesforce building an EHR or things like that. Given the regulations and the environment, I never see that happening. Although, with the money they have available to them, maybe they'll surprise us all.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/26/us-salesforce-com-health-exclusive-idUSKBN0IF0EA20141026?feedType=RSSfeedName=businessNews\">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/26/us-salesforce-com-health-exclusive-idUSKBN0IF0EA20141026?feedType=RSSfeedName=businessNews</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CRSH11404514156658121629302850</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRSH-114045</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DK0-V4K1-JCMN-Y2SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><timeReceived>12:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EMR and HIPAA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 11, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So as much as the idea which follows may seem laughable, it shouldn't be dismissed as the unhinged rant of someone with no influence engaging in some isolated \"thought experiment\" which isn't shared by others in leftyland.</p><p><br/><br/> Eskow, in a Tuesday column[2] at Salon, advocated regulating Internet titans Google, Amazon and Facebook as \"public utilities.\" His justification is that they \"define our lives,\" they're \"close to monopolies,\" and besides, employing a breezy myth still held by many in the press, \"Big Tech was created with publicly developed technology.\" Read on (the headline overstates Eskow's position; bolds are mine):<br/><br/><br/> Let's nationalize Amazon and Google: Publicly funded technology built Big Tech<br/> They're huge and ruthless and define our lives. They're close to monopolies. Let's make them public utilities<br/><br/><br/><br/> They're huge, they're ruthless, and they touch every aspect of our daily lives. Corporations like Amazon and Googlekeep expanding their reach and their power. Despite a history of abuses, so far the Justice Department has declined to take antitrust actions against them. But there's another solution.<br/><br/> Is it time to manage and regulate these companies as public utilities?<br/><br/> That argument's already been made about broadband access. ...<br/><br/> Broadband as a public utility? If not for corporate corruption of our political process, that would seem like an obvious solution. Instead, our nation's wireless access is the slowest and costliest in the world.<br/><br/> But why stop there? Policymakers have traditionally considered three elements when evaluating the need for a public utility: production, transmission, and distribution. Broadband is transmission. What about production and distribution?<br/><br/> The Big Tech mega-corporations have developed what Al Gore calls the 'Stalker Economy,' manipulating and monitoring as they go. But consider: They were created with publicly funded technologies, and prospered as the result of indulgent policies and lax oversight. They've achieved monopoly or near-monopoly status, are spying on us to an extent that's unprecedented in human history, and have the potential to alter each and every one of our economic, political, social and cultural transactions.<br/><br/> No matter how they spin it, these corporations were not created in garages or by inventive entrepreneurs. The core technology behind them is the Internet, a publicly funded platform for which they pay no users' fee. In fact, they do everything they can to avoid paying their taxes.<br/><br/> ...\u00a0Big Tech's use of public technology means that it operates in a technological 'commons,' which they are using solely for its own gain, without regard for the public interest. Meanwhile the United States government devotes considerable taxpayer resource to protecting them - from patent infringement, cyberterrorism and other external threats.<br/><br/> Eskow goes on to chronicle certain market position-abusing tactics of the three behemoths to justify his position. To the extent he is correct about any of them, they should be grounds for either prosecution or new legislation, not public utility treatment.<br/><br/> His premise is an echo of the \"You didn't build that\" arguments advanced by Massachusetts Senator <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>and Barack Obama during their U.S. Senate and presidential reelection campaigns, respectively.<br/><br/> Eskow's contention that the government gets sole credit for researching and building the \"core technology\" of the Internet is shaky at best. In 2012, as he attempted to \"debunk\" a claim made by Gordon Crovitz at the Wall Street Journal[3] that Xerox deserved full credit, Robert McMillan at Wired[4] tracked down Robert Taylor, the guy who left \"the Department of Defense's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) Information Processing Technologies program in the 1960s to run Xerox PARC's computer lab,\" and got the following response:<br/><br/>Xerox invented a lot more than just Ethernet. And many of the things that came out of Xerox \u2014 the PC and the graphical user interface \u2014 were crucial to the internet as we know it today, according to Robert Taylor, who we interviewed Monday.<br/><br/> To hear Taylor tell it, finding the inventor of the internet is a bit like finding the inventor of the blues. Its origins are murky and complex.<br/><br/> 'The origins of the internet include work both sponsored by the government and Xerox PARC, so you can't say that the internet was invented by either one alone,' he says.<br/><br/> So the government didn't solely build it.<br/><br/> Eskow's missive is an insult to Jeff Bezos, Google's founders, and Mark Zuckerberg, who, though far less than perfect in many respects (and who isn't?), built mulitibillion dollar businesses which have transformed how the world works, and mostly for the better.<br/><br/> Even if we accept Eskow's claim that the Internet was an entirely \"a publicly funded platform\" (which I don't), allowing the government to regulate its major players indefinitely would be like giving the original venture investors in any enterprise \u2014 be it high-tech Apple, Amazon, FacebookGoogle, HP, IBM, Microsoft or lower-tech companies \u2014 permanent veto power over managements' decisions. The results would be suboptimal, to say the least.<br/><br/> As to these entities' untouchable power, weren't people saying the same things about Microsoft, IBM, General Motors, and Apple (in music and phones) during the past several decades? Somehow, other competitors kept raising the bar and showed that these companies were not as invincible as once thought.<br/><br/> One can only begin to imagine how much innovation and economic growth would slow down if the government got its greedy hands on entities like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and others in the tech sector as their \"public utility\" regulators. Of course, as should be the case across the board, to the extent these companies are actually violating real laws, they should be prosecuted. Otherwise, history has shown that leaving them alone is a better idea than having the government start vetoing or dictating their moves.<br/><br/> And here's a parting shot: Richard, if these companies \"define\" your life, you need to go out and get one for yourself.<br/><br/> Cross-posted at BizzyBlog.com[5].<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thisisthebreakdown.com/About_Richard_Eskow.html\">http://www.thisisthebreakdown.com/About_Richard_Eskow.html</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/07/08/lets_nationalize_amazon_and_google_publicly_funded_technology_built_big_tech/?utm_source=twitterutm_medium=socialflow\">http://www.salon.com/2014/07/08/lets_nationalize_amazon_and_google_publicly_funded_technology_built_big_tech/?utm_source=twitterutm_medium=socialflow</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518?mg=reno64-wsjurl=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518.html\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518?mg=reno64-wsjurl=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518.html</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/07/xerox-internet/\">http://www.wired.com/2012/07/xerox-internet/</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizzyblog.com/2014/07/13/salon-author-lets-make-google-amazon-and-facebook-public-utilities/\">http://www.bizzyblog.com/2014/07/13/salon-author-lets-make-google-amazon-and-facebook-public-utilities/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST10777814052629468721831800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CN7-SC11-F03R-N2GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1158\"/><timeReceived>2:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 13, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So as much as the idea which follows may seem laughable, it shouldn't be dismissed as the unhinged rant of someone with no influence engaging in some isolated 'thought experiment' which isn't shared by others in leftyland.</p><p><br/> Eskow, in a Tuesday column[2] at Salon, advocated regulating Internet titans Google, Amazon and Facebook as 'public utilities.' His justification is that they 'define our lives,' they're 'close to monopolies,' and besides, employing a breezy myth still held by many in the press, 'Big Tech was created with publicly developed technology.' Read on (the headline overstates Eskow's position; bolds are mine):<br/><br/>Let's nationalize Amazon and Google: Publicly funded technology built Big Tech<br/>They're huge and ruthless and define our lives. They're close to monopolies. Let's make them public utilities<br/><br/>They're huge, they're ruthless, and they touch every aspect of our daily lives. Corporations like Amazon and Googlekeep expanding their reach and their power. Despite a history of abuses, so far the Justice Department has declined to take antitrust actions against them. But there's another solution.<br/> Is it time to manage and regulate these companies as public utilities?<br/> That argument's already been made about broadband access. \u2026<br/> Broadband as a public utility? If not for corporate corruption of our political process, that would seem like an obvious solution. Instead, our nation's wireless access is the slowest and costliest in the world.<br/> But why stop there? Policymakers have traditionally considered three elements when evaluating the need for a public utility: production, transmission, and distribution. Broadband is transmission. What about production and distribution?<br/> The Big Tech mega-corporations have developed what Al Gore calls the 'Stalker Economy,' manipulating and monitoring as they go. But consider: They were created with publicly funded technologies, and prospered as the result of indulgent policies and lax oversight. They've achieved monopoly or near-monopoly status, are spying on us to an extent that's unprecedented in human history, and have the potential to alter each and every one of our economic, political, social and cultural transactions.<br/> No matter how they spin it, these corporations were not created in garages or by inventive entrepreneurs. The core technology behind them is the Internet, a publicly funded platform for which they pay no users' fee. In fact, they do everything they can to avoid paying their taxes.<br/> \u2026\u00a0Big Tech's use of public technology means that it operates in a technological 'commons,' which they are using solely for its own gain, without regard for the public interest. Meanwhile the United States government devotes considerable taxpayer resource to protecting them - from patent infringement, cyberterrorism and other external threats.<br/><br/>Eskow goes on to chronicle certain market position-abusing tactics of the three behemoths to justify his position. To the extent he is correct about any of them, they should be grounds for either prosecution or new legislation, not public utility treatment.<br/> His premise is an echo of the 'You didn't build that' arguments advanced by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama during their U.S. Senate and presidential reelection campaigns, respectively.<br/> Eskow's contention that the government gets sole credit for researching and building the 'core technology' of the Internet is shaky at best. In 2012, as he attempted to 'debunk' a claim made by Gordon Crovitz at the Wall Street Journal[3] that Xerox deserved full credit, Robert McMillan at Wired[4] tracked down Robert Taylor, the guy who left 'the Department of Defense's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) Information Processing Technologies program in the 1960s to run Xerox PARC's computer lab,' and got the following response:<br/>Xerox invented a lot more than just Ethernet. And many of the things that came out of Xerox \u2014 the PC and the graphical user interface \u2014 were crucial to the internet as we know it today, according to Robert Taylor, who we interviewed Monday.<br/> To hear Taylor tell it, finding the inventor of the internet is a bit like finding the inventor of the blues. Its origins are murky and complex.<br/> 'The origins of the internet include work both sponsored by the government and Xerox PARC, so you can't say that the internet was invented by either one alone,' he says.<br/><br/>So the government didn't solely build it.<br/> Eskow's missive is an insult to Jeff Bezos, Google's founders, and Mark Zuckerberg, who, though far less than perfect in many respects (and who isn't?), built mulitibillion dollar businesses which have transformed how the world works, and mostly for the better.<br/> Even if we accept Eskow's claim that the Internet was an entirely 'a publicly funded platform' (which I don't), allowing the government to regulate its major players indefinitely would be like giving the original venture investors in any enterprise \u2014 be it high-tech Apple, Amazon, FacebookGoogle, HP, IBM, Microsoft or lower-tech companies \u2014 permanent veto power over managements' decisions. The results would be suboptimal, to say the least.<br/> As to these entities' untouchable power, weren't people saying the same things about Microsoft, IBM, General Motors, and Apple (in music and phones) during the past several decades? Somehow, other competitors kept raising the bar and showed that these companies were not as invincible as once thought.<br/> One can only begin to imagine how much innovation and economic growth would slow down if the government got its greedy hands on entities like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and others in the tech sector as their 'public utility' regulators. Of course, as should be the case across the board, to the extent these companies are actually violating real laws, they should be prosecuted. Otherwise, history has shown that leaving them alone is a better idea than having the government start vetoing or dictating their moves.<br/> And here's a parting shot: Richard, if these companies 'define' your life, you need to go out and get one for yourself.<br/> Cross-posted at NewsBusters.org[5].<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thisisthebreakdown.com/About_Richard_Eskow.html\">http://www.thisisthebreakdown.com/About_Richard_Eskow.html</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/07/08/lets_nationalize_amazon_and_google_publicly_funded_technology_built_big_tech/?utm_source=twitterutm_medium=socialflow\">http://www.salon.com/2014/07/08/lets_nationalize_amazon_and_google_publicly_funded_technology_built_big_tech/?utm_source=twitterutm_medium=socialflow</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518?mg=reno64-wsjurl=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518.html\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518?mg=reno64-wsjurl=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10000872396390444464304577539063008406518.html</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/07/xerox-internet/\">http://www.wired.com/2012/07/xerox-internet/</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tom-blumer/2014/07/13/salon-author-lets-make-google-amazon-and-facebook-public-utilities\">http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tom-blumer/2014/07/13/salon-author-lets-make-google-amazon-and-facebook-public-utilities</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BIZZ10062914052633569332193500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZZ-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CN7-XVV1-JCMN-Y3B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1157\"/><timeReceived>2:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BizzyBlog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 13, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Corporations like Amazon and Google keep expanding their reach and their power. Despite a history of abuses, so far the Justice Department has declined to take antitrust actions against them. But there's another solution.</p><p><br/> Is it time to manage and regulate these companies as public utilities?<br/> That argument's already been made about broadband access. In her book 'Captive Justice,' law professor Susan Crawford argues that 'high-speed wired Internet access is as basic to innovation, economic growth, social communication, and the country's competitiveness as electricity was a century ago.'<br/> Broadband as a public utility? If not for corporate corruption of our political process, that would seem like an obvious solution. Instead, our nation's wireless access is the slowest and costliest in the world.<br/> But why stop there? Policymakers have traditionally considered three elements when evaluating the need for a public utility: production, transmission, and distribution. Broadband is transmission. What about production and distribution?<br/> The Big Tech mega-corporations have developed what Al Gore calls the 'Stalker Economy,' manipulating and monitoring as they go. But consider: They were created with publicly-funded technologies, and prospered as the result of indulgent policies and lax oversight.

Based on the achievements of the previous decade, there are certainly high hopes. Although mainstream media will try to tell you otherwise, 2010 to 2020 was the most prosperous decade in our history. And so it should have been: humans as a species instinctively seek progress.</p><p>Big Tech dominated a decade of stellar market returns - in fact, the Financial Times calls it &amp; the decade of the Fangs&amp; Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) - and I believe these companies will continue to do so in the next 10 years.</p><p>Through innovation and scale, they've amassed unprecedented amounts of cash: Microsoft has $137bn on hand, Alphabet has $121bn, Apple $100bn, Facebook $52bn and Amazon $44bn.</p><p>That's more buying power than most countries. In my opinion, this is a good thing because it allows these companies to take risks many others can't afford to. These firms will strive to fix humanity's problems, with very little financial limitation.</p><p>I would not be surprised to see Big Tech branch out into health care aggressively in the next few years.</p><p>More specifically, preventative health care, like wearables that can detect and treat heart attacks and diabetes, as an example. In fact, I expect massive progress in the health-care sector over the next decade.</p><p>Healthy living is an uncompromisable priority for anyone who can afford it. As middle classes grow, the demand for quality health care will attract more money into the sector, pulling in large resources for innovation.</p><p>Health care is a highly regulated sector - and so it should be - but that does slow progress, which is why preventative health care is likely to be a huge theme. Expect to see a lot of progress in genetic sequencing, rewards and incentives for healthy living.</p><p>It's been 12 years since the 2008 financial crisis, and developed markets have learnt a lot. That's seen increased regulation of financial institutions, and very accommodative central banks.</p><p>I think that theme will continue, with historically low interest rates for decades to come. Technology has made us more efficient, which has resulted in cheaper goods from commodities to TVs, keeping inflation low, and I have no reason to believe the trend will change.</p><p>Longer bull runs</p><p>With low interest rates and friendly central banks, business cycles will be longer and steadier. Bull runs could span decades without large recessions or the financial collapses we have experienced in the past. That does not mean there won't be short-term turmoil: nasty shocks will always occur, but in general we will have the experience and the means to deal with them.</p><p>The &amp; rent&amp; economy will become more prolific. Uber and Airbnb are just scratching the surface of how we can be more efficient with what we already have. We'll also have more time on our hands. Four-day work weeks and remote working will become the norm and not the exception, giving humans more time for leisure. Experiences will be valued more than materials. Travel will thrive and so will online streaming, gaming and networking.</p><p>I have mostly spoken about trends in developed nodes. What will happen in the developing world? I think political misbehaviour will still be a common theme throughout the decade, but I also believe we will see good progress. The big advantage developing markets have is a lack of old legacy technologies. So instead of building fossil fuel power stations, energy sources can go straight to renewables.</p><p>The same applies to wireless internet, branchless banks and shopless retail. These new technologies are cheaper and far more efficient than the old ones. Smart investment here can help kick-start many struggling economies.</p><p>And because of low interest rates, there'll be plenty of money looking for opportunities in developing markets. Access to funding will be easier than ever before - especially from an increasingly influential China.</p><p>I expect to see big moves from its multinational powerhouses, like Tencent and Alibaba. These businesses will entrench themselves more into the Western world with a net positive impact. They go about things slightly differently to Western companies, and this will give them an advantage.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised to see them pushing harder into untapped markets in Africa and the rest of Asia.</p><p>Watch out for India too: it will become the next big growth driver of the global economy this decade.</p><p>Progress happens slowly and sometimes goes unnoticed, while disasters are quick, loud and sell headlines.</p><p>The next decade will be the same: we'll progress faster than ever, while probably complaining that things are getting worse.</p><p>But that is how we stay motivated.</p><p>Lotter is a portfolio manager at Vestact</p><p>I would not be surprised to see Big Tech branch out into health care aggressively in the next few years</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM1601MonShoprite</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0H-8KC1-DYT4-K50V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Federal Election Committee Supreme Court case. The case was filed against the FEC by the political action committee Citizens United over regulations on funding and restrictions on advertisements before elections. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, or BCRA, prevented corporations or special interest groups from funding political advertising through their general treasury. The District Court for Washington, D.C. upheld the law, but the case was appealed and overturned in the Supreme Court. Corporations had the same rights as individuals when it came to spending money on campaigns, it was decided. In the decade since the case was decided, the political landscape has morphed into something entirely unrecognizable.</p><p>In the 2010 midterm elections, campaign expenditures skyrocketed from $64 million to $294 million. Nearly half of that money came from newly-formed Political Action Committees (PACs) that are able to conceal their donors. This \"dark money\" had been present since Buckley v. Valeo in 1976, a Supreme Court case that eased disclosure requirements for political donations. But, in the wake of the Citizens United decision, these donations now have a sheen of legitimacy. The numbers continue to rise, and over a billion dollars were spent on advertisements for the 2018 midterms.</p><p>The years following the decision also gave rise to a new group of donors. Although this group is small in number, they have a disproportionate sway over the electoral process. Out of the $4.5 billion dollars raised by super PACs in the past eight years, $1 billion came from only 11 people, who are from both Republican and Democratic backgrounds. Funnily enough, two of the men on the list were Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, both of whom are now running for president. Bloomberg spent a record $100 million dollars in a month, furthering the financial bar for entry.\u00a0</p><p>The shockwaves the ruling sent through the legal system are even felt in the chaos of the Trump impeachment trial. Lev Parnas, one of Rudy Giuliani's associates and one of the figures central to the Ukraine controversy, apparently\u00a0cozied up to the Commander in Chief at an event held by the president for donors to Trump's PAC, America First Action. The donations came through via a limited liability company to conceal the identity of Parnas and his cohort, Igor Fruman. Through this, he was able to begin negotiations with Trump about the Biden investigation and the obstruction of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. The Citizens United case allowed Parnas to conceal his true intentions and easily stay under the radar.</p><p>A few more examples of dark money in politics compromising officials can be seen in the reluctance to combat price-fixing in the medical industry and the utter incompetence in legislating big tech. In 2019, the industry that spent the most on lobbying was the health sector, coming in at about $594 million. A majority of that was spent on combating legislation that involved price control on certain drugs, while another sum of it was spent on combating the Trump administration agenda to decrease drug prices. The industry's efforts to stall regulations stings in the face of the absurd and unaffordable pricing for prescription drugs.</p><p>In terms of tech, companies like Facebook and Google have been investing heavily in lobbying. Their spending has been ramping up in the face of privacy concerns and unfair market practices, obviously trying to influence lawmakers to get off their proverbial backs. It's incredibly difficult to fully gauge how much Capitol Hill has been compromised by lobbying and dark money, but the mere fact that we have to consider the prospect is the impetus to reform.\u00a0</p><p>Despite the frustrating state of campaign finance, one thing rings true. Americans overwhelmingly want to see a decrease in political spending. In 2018, Pew Research determined that 77 percent of people believe there should be limits in place on expenditures. It's a bipartisan conviction, with 71 percent of right-leaning people and 85 percent of left-leaning people supporting limits on money in politics. Recently, we've seen candidates denounce donations from PACs of questionable origin. Candidates for president have shown it's indeed possible to sustain a race on small donors. Candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both sworn off PAC donations altogether, each raising\u00a0millions of dollars. Despite jokes about his wine cave fundraiser, Pete Buttigieg has raised nearly half of his $50,000,000 from small individual contributions of $200 or less. Grassroots campaigning has become more and more popular.\u00a0</p><p>Tides are changing, but the influence Citizens United has had on the way politicians approach fundraising is clear. Dark money is sickeningly pervasive, keeping us guessing about whether or not our elected officials serve the people or special interest groups. Constituents have noticed and are trying to combat that with campaigns that draw from smaller donors. Large scale donors have upped the scale to match, with players like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer quite literally buying themselves a bid for the nomination. It's only been a decade, but the nature of campaigning has been irrevocably warped.</p><p>That doesn't mean all is lost: There are still things that people can do to help. Phonebank for or donate to smaller-scale campaigns, contact your local representatives to voice your concerns and stay aware of how your favorite politicians make their money. The website opensecrets.org keeps track of all funds spent by politicians on campaigning, making it incredibly easy to hold them responsible for their allegiances. In the face of overwhelming odds, it is of the utmost importance that you stay vigilant and stop our democracy from crumbling under the pressures of the corporate elite.\u00a0</p><p>Sam Fogel can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samfogel@umich.edu\">samfogel@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4487675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y32-WRX1-DY7P-T06H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002FSY</classCode><className>VALEO SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS336390 OTHER MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FR (PAR)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ann Arbor</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This is on top of the $14 billion that the company has spent in the last year. </p><p>That sizeable budget will be used in AI efforts outside of Bixby and on fringe AI technologies like novel uses for deep learning and machine learning, though Samsung has yet to make any specific announcements regarding to allotment of the cash. Speaking in a sweeping sort of sense about where Samsung's[1] AI sights are set, Kim touched on the fact that voice-controlled smart devices, as well as voice assistants in more centralized devices like smartphones and computers, see somewhere upwards of 600 million unique users per year, and that number will only grow from here. Samsung's own assistant, Bixby, can be found on the company's flagship phones, and is at the heart of a new smart speaker project[2]. That means it's a safe bet that at least some of that research fund will be spent on improving Bixby. Samsung is also involved in self-driving cars, manufacturing, and other ventures wherein AI could prove beneficial, so it's anybody's guess where else that budget could end up going. Many experts have spent the past few years warning the general public that AI technology[3] can be dangerous, and international authorities have even worked on putting together regulations to stop the technology from changing the face of warfare in a way that mankind wouldn't benefit from. Samsung's uses for AI seem innocuous at present, but that's not to say that big tech companies used to producing consumer-facing solutions are entirely without risk; Google, for example, recently stepped down from Project Maven, a US Department of Defense contract that had the search giant helping to give drones the ability to analyze captured footage on the fly to seek out and identify human faces. Such technology could very easily be used for war, and should the worst of the science fiction-esque predictions come true and AI tech turn against us, it could theoretically be used to hunt down targets with startling ease. That is just one of many potential examples that leave experts, leaders and authorities of all sorts at odds about just how dangerous AI is and how it should be approached.

Because February 24 is when the Mobile World Congress (MWC) kicks off in Barcelona, and the year's second (chronologically speaking[1]) big tech fair was believed to be eyed by Samsung for the mid-range phablet's announcement.<br/> Since literally everything about the Note 3 Neo[2], save for pricing details, has been uncovered[3], one has to wonder whether Sammy wouldn't be better off just getting it over with and rolling out the 5.5-incher early. After all, once you swing by the FCC and score the regulatory agency's stamp of approval, what's there to tweak on your device?<br/> Of course, maybe the Koreans aren't ready to ramp up production just yet. But they'd better get a move on, as the Note 3 always looked like a gamble, with lower-end hardware than the original Note 3, but possibly not exactly a budget-friendly pricing structure.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://wimages.vr-zone.net/2014/01/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-3-Neo-LTE-FCC.jpg\">http://wimages.vr-zone.net/2014/01/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-3-Neo-LTE-FCC.jpg</url><br/> Think about it, 720p resolution is pretty solid upper mid-range material, the 'true' hexa-core Exynos CPU is on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600, 2 GB RAM is, well, plenty, and the 3,100 mAh battery sounds positively dreamy. So how low do you think Sammy can go? $400? No way. $500, $550? That's more like it.<br/> Back to the FCC certification, let's again underline this specific Note 3 Neo variant supports Korean-friendly band 5 LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, and WCDMA 850/1900 MHz.

Thanks for watching Strange Inheritance. And remember, you can't take it with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Happy Tuesday and welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Tuesday, September 8, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle for the swing states now heating up. Over the Labor Day weekend, President Trump touting a rebounding economy and getting tough on crime. President Trump threatening to cut economic ties with China and also issuing a stern warning if Joe Biden wins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congress is returning today, desperate Americans are hoping the stimulus stalemate quickly comes to an end.</p><p>Market this morning picking up where they left off last week. Take a look in the red with technology heavy NASDAQ taking another hit this morning. We are looking at a sharp sell-off for the NASDAQ down 271 points right now; the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ snapped a five-week winning streak. Friday, Dow marking its worst week since late June, but the markets, as you can see, are down across the board.</p><p>Large Labor Day parties, meanwhile, raising concerns about a coronavirus spike.</p><p>And then creating a futuristic fan experience at the U.S. Open. IBM supercomputer Watson using artificial intelligence to allow fan interaction, even with empty stands.</p><p>Mornings with Maria is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are under pressure, take a look at European indices where markets are under pressure as concerns grow over a no-deal Brexit. The FTSE 100 down 17; the CAC quarante in Paris down 63; and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 108.</p><p>We have Germany showing signs of a slow recovery. Exports there rising 4.7 percent in the month of July. Imports were up just over 1 percent that was far below pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Checking Asian markets this morning, take a look at what happened overnight. Green across the board in Asia, best performer as you can see Japan; Nikkei average up at three quarters of a percent; same situation with the Shanghai Composite in China.</p><p>Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. President Trump and Joe Biden clashing over a possible COVID-19 vaccine. The president demanding an apology from the democratic nominee after using what he calls anti-vaccine rhetoric.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Under my leadership, we'll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now. It's a political rhetoric, that's all it is, just for politics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The comments coming after Joe Biden said that he did not trust the president on a vaccine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: One of the problems is the way he's playing with politics, because he said so many things that aren't true. I'm worried if we do have really good vaccine, people will be reluctant to take it. So he's undermining public comments. But pray to God we have it. If I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I'd do it. If it cost me the election, I'd do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nearly 190,000 people in the United States have now died from COVID-19.</p><p>Well, demonstrators in Rochester, New York gathering for a sixth straight night. They're demanding justice for Daniel Prude, the protests ending peacefully with no arrests. Daniel Prude died back in March. But a video of the incident was released last week. Officers had found Prude naked in the streets. The officers placing a spit hood over his head designed to protect officers from saliva then allegedly held him down for two minutes.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's turn to the unrest in Oregon. The hundreds of President Trump supporters and members of the group, the Proud Boys, holding a Labor Day rally in Salem. Police arrested three people there after they were seen tackling a counter protester.</p><p>Wildfires are raging across Northern California this morning. Gusty winds and dry conditions forcing PG&amp;E to cut power to more than 170,000 customers in Northern California. More than 2 million acres burned in a record- breaking sesh season amid concerns for more devastating fires on the way.</p><p>Well, this morning, crews will attempt to rescue more than 50 people trapped by the massive Creek Fire. The National Guard flying helicopters into the disaster zone overnight, but the smoke was too heavy.</p><p>Some encouraging news in the battle against COVID-19 this morning. Florida reporting its lowest number of new cases in a single day since June, that's just over 1800. But the overall number could surge following the Labor Day weekend, like it did after the 4th of July holiday.</p><p>And for the first time, there are no northeastern states in the top 10 in COVID cases per capita. According to Johns Hopkins University data, Sun Belt states have the most cases right now.</p><p>Markets are mixed this morning as Wall Street looks for a rebound after a rough week last week. Weak performing technology stocks dragging the NASDAQ within 25 points of a correction last week, That markets worst week since March as you can see this morning, while we are looking at declines for the last week of better than 3 percent on the NASDAQ.</p><p>Joining me right now is The Haverford Trust Company head of Investment Strategy, Hank Smith; also joining the conversation this morning, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and the King's College Chair of the Program in Business and Finance and the Fox News contributor, Brian Brenberg.</p><p>Great to see you. Great to be back with you, Dagen. Good morning, Dagen and Brian.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.</p><p>PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Morning. Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me kick it off with you, Hank. Well, happy to have you here. We got a new round of stimulus hanging in the balance. The Congress comes back this morning, the Senate expected to take up a new bill this week, as both sides remain deadlocked over key issues like that $600 unemployment package.</p><p>Goldman Sachs released a note saying that, it's hopeful that a bill will be passed by the end of September through the price tag, although the price tag may be lower than the $2 trillion projected. What's your take on all of this and its impact on markets, Hank?</p><p>HANK SMITH, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, HAVERFORD TRUST COMPANY: Right. Well, Maria, I'm not sure we need the stimulus. If you go back to late July, investors thought it was very important to continue with some form of PPP and the added paycheck benefits. But we didn't get that and it wasn't an issue for the market, and we still have tremendous positive linearity and we saw it in the jobs report last week.</p><p>ISM Manufacturing Services are strong. So the economy is recovering, and let's not forget, we've already had over $5 trillion in fiscal stimulus. Not all of it has been spent. And the extraordinary monetary stimulus that's going to be in place for a while, I mean, Jay Powell just said, interest rates are going to remain low for several years.</p><p>So these are the drivers for the market. And whether we get some added stimulus, I don't think it's going to be critical for the economy or for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you feel good about the backdrop. You talk about those jobs numbers that we saw on Friday, then there's the valuation story. Do you feel good about the growth expectations for the rest of the year before and after the election? And what about tech and this dismantling of all of this huge rally that we've been watching, this entire year for tech?</p><p>SMITH: Sure. And that's probably overdue. I mean, it's been a one-way parabolic move up in tech, and particularly in the FANG complex, add a few initials there for about seven stock and that is unsustainable.</p><p>So a pullback is healthy and this is not analogous to the late '90s where you had companies with no revenues, no earnings, just a story. Here you have real revenues, real earnings, real cash flow, and really strong fundamentals. But a pullback can be - is, in our view, a healthy thing here. So we're positive looking toward the end of this year, but recognize there's going to be volatility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, volatility has been certainly with us and we're not expecting any different, but the level that these tech stocks have gotten to for so many was just not sustainable. We'll see what happens now.</p><p>Brian Brenberg, jump in here. As Steven Mnuchin continues to say, he's optimistic that we will see another stimulus. Brian.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. Hank, Brian Brenberg here. I'm not optimistic. I'm with you. I actually don't see a stimulus happening, because I actually don't think Democrats in the house want a stimulus to happen and I don't think they're willing to compromise below that $2 trillion mark. I'm with you. I don't think that the economy necessarily needs it. But I think that the election now after Labor Day is going to be weighing on investors much more. They're going to be considering the likelihood that you get a Biden presidency with much more progressive policies.</p><p>Tell me, what that possibility means for investors over the next two months?</p><p>SMITH: Well, let me first state one of our rules of investing is, don't let politics get in the way of investing. Having said that though, I think the market would be very comfortable with a Biden win combined with the Republicans keeping the Senate. And then a lot of those progressive policy talking points will not come to fruition.</p><p>Now, if the Democrats do a complete sweep, I think that's a different story. I do not think that is priced into the market right now. And that could create--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: --some volatility as we get closer there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the policies are very different, so you have to expect that if we were to see Wall Street start believing that, the policies in place would be changed. That would certainly be market moving, right, Hank?</p><p>SMITH: Oh, absolutely. Look, the policies of this current administration have been excellent for the stock market. They've been excellent for the economy, despite some of the trade policy and despite not being able to get--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: --in the immigration reform, tax reform, regulatory reform have been huge tailwinds for both the economy and for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Hank, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Of course, we'll be watching and we will talk with you soon.</p><p>Hank Smith joining us there as we were talking markets improving a bit, up 40 points on the Dow Futures right now.</p><p>Here is your morning mover. Tesla, take a look at the stock plunging better than 11 percent ahead of the open this morning. It is now down 10.3 percent. The automaker will not be included in the S&amp;P 500, instead Etsy, Teradyne and Catalent are being added to the index. Despite these losses, Tesla shares are still up 400 percent so far this year.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning. Quick break.</p><p>And when we come back, next up on Mornings with Maria, retired General Jack Keane is here weighing in on President Trump's promise to scale back U.S. economic ties with China. We will get into it.</p><p>Next hour I'll be speaking with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, discussing the future of the latest stimulus package. You'll want to hear what Meadows has to say about all of that.</p><p>And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, we have got Allianz Chief Economic Adviser, Mohamed El-Erian, on markets. Don't miss it.</p><p>You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cracking down on China, President Trump vowing economic retaliation against Beijing over its expanding military and its role in the coronavirus pandemic. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. I don't want them building a military like they're building right now and they're using our money to build it. If they can't do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it some place else and send it into our country.</p><p>We'll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China and we'll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired General Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>Your reaction to all of this. You said this so many times on this program over and over again, that China has the fastest growing military and now we see the latest in terms of the navy and the president reacting.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE (RETIRED), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, absolutely. The idea of decoupling ourselves from the Chinese Communist Party economically is actually a move in the right direction. I don't think we can completely decouple ourselves, because our economies are so intertwined. But clearly a focus on what we want to decouple, it's only the pandemic heightened everyone's concern about our dependency on the pharmaceutical industry in China, but it's also a dependency on the technology.</p><p>And the main thing the American people have to understand, when we have the United States company involved in China in a joint venture with a Chinese private company, if that technology that they're manufacturing has any application whatsoever to the Chinese military, because of the fusion of their civil society and their military society, that technology will be automatically passed to the military. And that is what has got to stop, because we are assisting them.</p><p>Example, Google is contributing in the development of advanced technology in artificial intelligence, which is fused to the military as a result of it. And they're using it to surveil their own people and control them and they're also using it to develop advanced weapon systems based on that technology that we are helping to provide to the Chinese Communist Party. This is the stuff that has to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean that is so outrageous, General. And we know that Google walked away from Project Maven, this was the project for the Department of Defense that Google's employees balked about and they didn't want Google working with the U.S. government and yet they've got an AI lab in Beijing and doing exactly what you just said. That is so outrageous.</p><p>So this Pentagon report last week saying that, \"China is creating a world- class military that can conduct joint operations across the globe\" should frighten people, because we've seen what China does with it. They've been bullying other countries in the South China Sea, bullying India, 20 soldiers are dead, bullying Hong Kong. So what are the ramifications of this and what should the United States do about it?</p><p>KEANE: Well, first of all, China clearly is on a path to achieve world dominance. They want to have economic and military superiority. And that's the reality of it. They want to change the international order that existed for 70-plus years post World War II to severe some influence that are more contributory to their national objectives.</p><p>So yes, the military is a large part of that. Most rapid growing military in the world, largest army, navy, largest coast guard, largest rocket and missile formations in the world and the largest air force--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: --in that region. All that said, we, when you get in to the quality of our military in terms of our weapons and our people and our training and our performance, and the fact that we're battle-tested, we have a superior military to theirs</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KEANE: But they want what we have. And listen, we know how to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: We dealt with the Soviet Union in the same way. We have to organize ourselves in a coalition with our partners and allies and work and push against China. We can do this, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I don't know that corporate America has gotten the memo yet. So there's an issue there. But let me ask you about news this morning.</p><p>One of the top stories in the Journal certainly, China's new data-security standards, Beijing's foreign ministry today calling on all countries to maintain an open supply chain for information and communications technology. It's been about a month since secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed the clean network program, which bans Chinese telecom companies from internet infrastructure used by the U.S. and its allies.</p><p>So General, now you see China pushing back, trying to divide this and using different standards. Which of these programs will be successful? And should we be concerned that now China is telling countries don't listen to America and their clean network, we're going to set the global standards for telecom and technology and the internet?</p><p>KEANE: Well, certainly, this is going to be a combative situation. This is a knee-jerk reaction, I think it's largely face-saving on the part of the Chinese Communist Party, because of the aggressiveness of the United States and also like-minded countries are now resisting Huawei in the 5G development. They are pushing back on the Chinese apps, because the United States have provided them with the evidence, if they didn't have it already that these technology companies are conducting cyber espionage and the evidence is overwhelming, Maria.</p><p>So yes, there's going to be a confrontation over technology development and how that is secured as the countries go forward. And it may have some impact long-term on the internet. It remains to be seen. But we are taking the right stance to protect our technology and to protect our secrets and other like-minded countries are starting to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, General. We'll keep watching. Very important subject, love to talk with you about it always. Thank you, sir. General Jack Keane--</p><p>KEANE: Yes, good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: --joining us this morning in Washington. We'll see you soon, Jack. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, swing states showdown. President Trump and Joe Biden hitting the campaign trail. They hit it hard over the Labor Day weekend. We're going to take you there. We're looking at where voters stand in key battleground states.</p><p>Stay with us. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Counting down to Election Day, President Trump and former Vice President Biden have eight weeks to make their case to American voters. We're down to 56 days until the big day. The focus yesterday, the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history, world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the great depression. Biden and his very liberal running mate, the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, is not a competent person in my opinion, would destroy this country and would destroy this economy.</p><p>BIDEN: President Trump keeps talking about how great this economy is, how great the stock market is. But it hadn't been so great for the rest of us, millions of people out of work, evictions on the rise, 20 million people worrying about whether they're going to lose their home. What in God's name else can this guy do?</p><p>Let's look at one simple fact. This president is on track to be the only president in modern history to end up with fewer jobs at the end of his term than existed in America when he began his term.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's politics. Dagen McDowell, no mention there of the fact that the pandemic and the shutdown is what caused all of these job losses from China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And President Trump won the highest office in the land because of the lackluster; particularly wage growth that Americans, particularly working Americans experienced under President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. But what was going into the pandemic shutdown, you had the lowest skilled workers, wages rising at the fastest pace in two decades. You had rank-and-file workers' wages rising at a faster pace than their bosses, actually shrinking income inequality in this country.</p><p>And we have had, in the last four months, a comeback in four months from the virus shutdown in terms of the unemployment rate falling and the job growth and other metrics that took four - that took three years under Obama and Biden, the Wall Street Journal editorial page writes about that over the weekend.</p><p>One other thing. How do you think raising taxes on corporations, raising taxes to the tune of $4 trillion total, which is Joe Biden's proposal, you're essentially, by raising corporate taxes, taking money away from those very companies that they could use to rehire people, hire new workers, and pay them higher wages? At the same time, get rid of fossil fuels in 15 years and the production of electricity in this country, that is going to raise people's energy prices. So how does that help anybody?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, talking about $4 trillion in tax increases, and it's not even being applied, that revenue, to fix our deficit problem, our debt problem, because much of that money is needed to pay for these other programs, like the Clean Energy Program that you just referred to.</p><p>Look, Brian, I know you don't think we're going to get a stimulus package, but even if we don't get one before the election, those jobs numbers are certainly indicating, this economy is coming back.</p><p>BRENBERG: That's right. And President Trump is pushing that. He's saying, this is a track record story. Look at the Biden-Obama track record, look at my track record, you decide. And by the way, Biden is talking about shutdowns? He's the candidate who said, I will shutdown this economy again if the scientists tell me to. If you're going to do anything to stall this (inaudible) shutting things down again, he should take a pledge not to shut down the economy and President Trump should push him on it. That would be a game-changer. I don't think he'll do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's true too. Good point.</p><p>Let's slip in a short break. When we come back, Tennis star Novak Djokovic punished for hitting a line judge, a massive fine for the world's top player. We'll tell you about it.</p><p>Then it's the big show making waves in the Hamptons. I'll be speaking with the stars of million-dollar beach house. Wait until you see this.</p><p>We're back right after this break. Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, September 8th, let's take a look at markets this morning at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures picking up where they left off last week, and that is in the red, the massive losses are happening in the Nasdaq. Take a look at this selloff that we are watching this morning. The tech heavy Nasdaq taking a hit to the tune of 2.30 percent right now, it is down 264 points. The Dow is down 38, and the S&amp;P down 25.</p><p>This after the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq snapped a five-week winning streak last week, the Dow down two of the last three weeks as you see, the momentum has turned negative and tech is leading markets lower. Global markets this morning look like this, European indices also under pressure, concerns growing over a no deal Brexit, the FT100 down 11, the CAC Quarante down 66, the Dax Index down 115. In Asia overnight, it was green across the board, take a look, best performer up three-quarters of a percent in Japan and in China, Shanghai Composite and the Nikkei Average.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's Samsung landing a major contract with Verizon. Cheryl Casone with those details right now. Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Maria. Yes, Verizon is going to pay Samsung $6.6 billion to help the company build its 5G network. Samsung going to provide equipment and services through the end of 2025 according to a regulatory filing. The deal is seen as a major boost to Samsung's goal of becoming a major 5G supplier. Taking a look at Verizon in the pre-market despite all the red arrows you see in the market, stock is actually up a little more than a quarter of a percent right now.</p><p>More problems for Boeing. The FAA reportedly reviewing quality control lapses at his 787 Dreamliner plant. Certain parts made at the South Carolina facility failed to meet design standard according to the \"Wall Street Journal\". Issues are said to stretch back almost a decade. Eight Dreamliners are now grounded, taking a look at Boeing, Dow component stock is substantially down, one and three quarters of a percent this morning. And finally, the Tokyo Olympic games are taking place next Summer with or without a vaccine.</p><p>John Coats; the vice president of the International Olympic Committee says that the Olympics will be the games that conquered COVID, the 2020 Summer games were postponed due to the pandemic. The Tokyo games, Maria, set to start July 23rd, 2021. And those are your headlines, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thanks so much. Meanwhile, hitting the campaign trail hard, we are now 56 days away from the election, the Labor Day weekend was a big one for the two candidates. The race for the White House tightening now, President Trump teasing a potential vaccine, promising new jobs as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will delivered very soon, now you could have a very big surprise coming up. And in 2021, we'll create 10 million jobs at least in the first 10 months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, rival Joe Biden hitting back on safety in terms of a new vaccine and the president's promise on jobs. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR 2020: If the president announced tomorrow we have a vaccine, would you take it? Only if we knew all of what went into it because so far, nothing he's told us has been true. This president is on track to be the only president in modern history to end up with fewer jobs at the end of his term than existed in America when he began his term.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Trump campaign director of Data and Strategy, Matt Braynard and Rebelle Communications CEO and Democratic strategist Laura Fink. Great to see you both this morning, thank you so much for being here. Matt, kick us off here, what do you think about the candidates' messages over the weekend?</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, SENIOR ADVISER, TAKE BACK OUR REPUBLIC: Yes, I know Joe Biden is making a play for his home state of Pennsylvania, but the problem is he spent the last 10 years telling everybody west of Pennsylvania he's going to kick them out of their jobs because he oppose fracking, oppose coal mining and any kind of fossil-fuel related industry, and that's pivotal to that state. And that is for him a must win state. And now, he's running around, trying to convince people that, oh, you know, I didn't really mean what I said, you're not going to lose your jobs, still going to support your industry.</p><p>Despite having gone over and over and over again, telling people look me in my eyes, I'm going to -- I'm going to shut down the fossil fuel industry. And it's -- I don't think it's going to sell in Pennsylvania, that's where he's putting his effort now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so what about that, Laura? What is Joe Biden's plan for the economy with the -- we know already that he wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. What else do you believe is critical for the economy that Joe Biden is pushing.</p><p>LAURA FINK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, REBELLE COMMUNICATIONS: Well, let me first address the fact that fracking right now would not -- can't -- doesn't even rate in terms of an economic viable solution because of the oil prices as we all know from looking at the market. So, that seems a little bit out of hand. That said --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Unless you work at that industry?</p><p>FINK: Joe Biden's economic recovery plan is frankly what he did in 2008 with Barack Obama, saving the auto industry. He's shown and proven that he can accelerate a recovery in a way that we have not seen President Trump even attempt to do, with six months to get the economy on --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But with all due respect, Laura, that fact --</p><p>FINK: Track and the coronavirus under control --</p><p>BARTIROMO: With all due respect, Laura, that's not true. Yes, that's not true because --</p><p>FINK: Which part are you saying is not true, Maria?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAYNARD: It's not true, I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The slowest recovery of any economy -- no, you just have to look at the --</p><p>FINK: Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Numbers, he oversaw the slowest recovery --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>After 2008.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Let's talk about what's happening right now, there's --</p><p>FINK: Well, let me just jump in there and say that the jobs -- the number of jobs, frankly, is slowing. So, here we are in the middle of an economic crisis connected to a health crisis and a pure failure on the part of the president to address either one substantively. You've got to look at where we are right now. That's how Americans are going to be voting --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Joe Biden's alternative --</p><p>FINK: Not only hearing about economic numbers and minor points.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Joe Biden's alternative is to shut the economy down --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Joe Biden --</p><p>BRAYNARD: And part of the reason the economy is hurting so much now is because you have so many Democrat governors in their states mismanaging horrifically this pandemic, and still completely locking down their states. States like New York, states like Pennsylvania that it's really out of the president's hands when these governors decide they're going to completely shut down these states despite having tremendous number of COVID deaths.</p><p>FINK: It's out of his hands, really? Yes --</p><p>BRAYNARD: And they need to own that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why this battle for the swing states, the battle for the swings states is really ramping up. You mentioned, Matt, Pennsylvania, Joe Biden is in Pennsylvania, he was there yesterday, President Trump is headed to North Carolina and Florida today to talk with voters. So, Laura, what about that? Where do you think the voters --</p><p>FINK: So, let's talk --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stand in these crucial states where jobs are among the most important issues?</p><p>FINK: I totally agree with that, and I think Joe Biden is up by around 4, 5 points in Pennsylvania. He's up by a couple of --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Poll numbers aren't an argument --</p><p>FINK: They're clearly battleground states. But what I would tell you is I would rather be in Joe Biden's position going into the last 60 days of the election than in President Trump's. He is behind in virtually every critical swing state for him. And that's because really, it's about -- you know, we're talking about all these issues, but at the end of the day, voters are deciding based on who they can trust, and right now, they're saying over and over again that they trust Joe Biden with this economy and more fundamentally, they trust him with the coronavirus recovery because they're not buying what's being sold here that it's all the governor's fault.</p><p>They know that a president needs to lead in crisis like this. That is the ultimate referendum on his performance, and right now he's failing with voters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BRAYNARD: You know, the president has --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Laura --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Moved -- mounted to get this -- to get this vaccine developed faster than any vaccine in the history of the world to try to save our most vulnerable. Suddenly, the Democrat ticket has turned anti-vaxxer. Whether or not this vaccine --whether they think it's going to be successful or not, they're already throwing cold water on it, saying, we're not going to take it. So, they'd rather have people who are vulnerable to this disease be afraid of taking a vaccine that could save their lives because it might make Trump --</p><p>FINK: That's gibberish --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Look good if he actually ends up getting this vaccine through and saving people's lives. Kamala Harris said she wouldn't take it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Laura, what about the fact that Joe -- I mean, that's true in terms of Kamala Harris saying she wouldn't take it. I mean, she -- this kind of rhetoric being spoken about now to scare people to not take the vaccine. But Laura, you're mentioning the economy, Joe Biden said very clearly just a few weeks ago, I would shut it down. I mean, can we really afford another shutdown right now? You've got small business owners out there desperate for some foot traffic --</p><p>FINK: Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: For revenue, just to keep the lights on. And Joe Biden says we're going to shut it down again.</p><p>FINK: Well, here's what I'd say. I'd say that you have to look at the coronavirus effort first. You have to look at the case rate, and you have to look at the infection rate. We're seeing South Dakota, Iowa and Maine see outbreaks. And your response to it, you cannot have an economy when the coronavirus is raging and you can't pretend they're disconnected. So, to get those small business owners --</p><p>BRAYNARD: What's Biden's solution? I mean --</p><p>FINK: Let their doors open, it's important to get that under control, and right now it's simply not.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Biden has offered no compelling solution and everything he said on this, just much like foreign policy, everything he said has turned out to be wrong like not stopping flights coming back from China. Absolutely wrong. And the problem here is that, look, this economy is surging back and he is exactly the wrong person to take lead. You say people trust him with the economy, I mean, he can't even be trusted to read a teleprompter correctly.</p><p>FINK: I mean, that may be you, but the American people are not on the same page right now. Frankly, they're looking</p><p>BRAYNARD: You've got poll numbers and we're talking issues here --</p><p>FINK: To Joe Biden in virtually every category and rating the entire --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAYNARD: Yes, poll numbers, it's not an argument --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I think most people trust -- I think most people Trump -- never, I think most people trust Trump on the economy, Laura. I mean, when you look at these -- even the polls, and you can argue if the polls are right or not --</p><p>FINK: Well, you may have a few points on the economy, but literally, Maria, literally, every other category --</p><p>BRAYNARD: His own campaign doesn't trust him without a teleprompter --</p><p>FINK: To keep them safe, they trust Biden --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>FINK: More to recover the coronavirus outbreak, they trust Biden more --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, keep them safe, what is --</p><p>FINK: I mean, you look at -- to handle crime, they trust Biden more.</p><p>BRAYNARD: Why should they trust him more? Why should they trust him more on -- name one thing he said that made any sense that would make us any better than we are right now. Name one thing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you all are both very --</p><p>FINK: Crime and unrest -- we've got crime and unrest --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we're not -- we're trying to look at the actual reality of what's happening. You haven't heard anything in terms of the crime and unrest from Joe Biden's camp. I mean, for the first time you mentioned just the other day, but this has been going on for months now, Laura. You're right. People want to make sure that their families are safe, but you haven't seen any --</p><p>FINK: So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Solutions on the left in terms of making sure people's families are safe.</p><p>BRAYNARD: But he's causing the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Out of prison.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean --</p><p>FINK: Fundamentally -- yes, let me get in here. So, you're not arguing with me on the substance that, the fact of the matter is that polling shows that the Americans trust Biden more with both racial injustice issues and with the rise in crime. They trust him more. And the reason they trust him more -- and he did come out and gave a very eloquent speech, condemning the violence and talking about the need to talk about the root problems, so I - - you should take a look at that. It's a great speech.</p><p>And he is going to campaign on this. But frankly, you know, voters are rating this issue at more like 4 percent, 5 percent, the fear of crime. So, this is more blown up than one might think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>FINK: And frankly, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, poll numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I think the Democrats -- yes, I think the Democrats have made a tactical mistake not being in front, getting in front of the crime that we're seeing across the country. Laura Fink, Matt Braynard, great to see you both --</p><p>BRAYNARD: And by bailing people out of prison, they're confident --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll keep following this -- all right, we'll take a break and come right back, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Technology stocks in focus once again this morning on Wall Street. The Nasdaq futures point to a sharp loss at the start of trading this morning, Nasdaq now down 258 points, the sector seeing the worst selloff in more than 5 months just last week. Joining me right now is the global head of Technology Investment Strategy at Deutsche Bank, Apjit Walia. And Apjit, it is always great to see you, thank you so much for being here. You know, I was just reading your report on the U.S. and China when it comes to technology which you did such a great job just in the last couple of weeks. First, tell me your thoughts on tech and what has taken place here with the Nasdaq close to correction territory once again.</p><p>APJIT WALIA, GLOBAL HEAD OF TECH STRATEGY, DEUTSCHE BAK: Great to be here, Maria. So, we spoke about China about a month ago, and last week. we talked about digital inequity in the country. And I believe what's happened is the anger which has been there, we saw the globalization a few years ago, of course, the last six months or so was towards China, and the anger, the resentment in the public is moving towards big tech. That caught me to see. We find that two out of three Americans now are unhappy with big tech. And I think that is something which is not well discounted either in markets or by the political leadership.</p><p>And as we head towards elections, this resentment might get on these campaigns towards this -- towards big tech and as well -- post-elections, our view is, no matter who wins, big tech will get more scrutiny. And the last thing we see is that the e-commerce demand curve which was pulled forward because of COVID, that's largely discounted in big tech. And so, these are three headwinds we see which are creating the issues we started seeing last week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess it doesn't help that big tech actually gained $2 trillion in market value, you're right, during COVID. So, you're seeing these companies get richer even as the broad public distrusts them. What do you make of this story this morning, one of the lead stories in the journal, China launching an initiative to set global data security rules, Apjit?</p><p>WALIA: Yes, of course, you know, the -- what's happened in the U.S.-China relationship the last few months is, of course, there's been a lot of strong statements coming out of the U.S., the Chinese have not really reacted substantively. And I think that is what is created, the market hasn't had a major impact. I believe China wants to take leadership in tech, that's what they want to do, whether it's in data security or a blockchain, that will continue. I think that their game is to wait until the elections and see the outcome and then take its position in this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In the past, when people see big selloffs in tech, they think that maybe this is a good moment to get in. You don't see it that way?</p><p>WALIA: Yes, I think -- you know, you know, I'm a cycle guy. That's what I've been doing all my life is tech cycles. I believe that near term, the tech cycle is peaking. I believe that most people that buy the dip has worked, what's the best shop ratio has been long on asset for quite the dip in the last 10 years, and you know, that's a muscle memory, people say let's do that. And of course, you've got a balance set up the last week, there might be some bottoming, but we believe at least an election until the end of the year, you read on the strength and tech should be sold.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you want to do then? Do you rotate into other areas? And is this going to impact the broader market and the industry as a whole, given the fact that technology has been such a leadership for the S&amp;P and for the broad market?</p><p>WALIA: You know, it's hard to make a market call. You've got a lot of catalysts, you've got more damage since potentially coming out, the vaccine news. So, I'm not going to take a call directly in the market, but on a relative basis, I think tech leadership, especially big tech leadership I think until elections is -- any strength should be used to sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there, Apjit, great to see you this morning, thanks very much. Apjit Walia from --</p><p>WALIA: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deutsche Bank this morning, and we are looking at them selling this morning, that's for sure. Nasdaq down 260 points, coming up, your morning mover, the hot stock investors are looking at this morning, plus, Novak Djokovic punished for hitting a line judge, the massive fine for the world's top tennis player, we'll be back right after the break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, going home is not easy, 52 percent of young adults moving back home because of the pandemic. This is the first time on record so many have lived with their parents, Brian, are you surprised by the number? Where are your kids?</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, it's the shutdown economy. I mean, it hits younger workers hardest, it's hard to break in when nothing's open. So you talk about the fallout from things like that and the prospect of doing it again, you're going to hit the young worst. I hope they remember that, frankly, when they go to the polls in November.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we'll see about that. Next up, more money problems, financial advisers said to be giving men better money advice than women. Studies show advisors pushing women into riskier investments which could widen the gender investment gap. Dagen, what do you make of this?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Don't go to -- women don't need to go to advisors, don't get suckered into it. You can do it on your own. You're smart enough and we don't need to -- we don't need to basically be led astray by bad advice from men -- by the way, the study was done in Hong Kong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're not -- it sounds like you don't even buy it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think -- it's possible. I'm not -- I'm not disagreeing with the study. It was done in Hong Kong. It was not done here in the United States. And I'm just saying that if it is true, then women should not be going to financial advisors. I don't know why anybody would, you can do it yourself on your own.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Women are quite smart with their money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and in this time where you've got so much information, you can arm yourself with the right information. I agree. Hey, how about this, Djokovic is out, Novak Djokovic, the world's top tennis player disqualified from the U.S. Open after hitting a ball in the direction of a line judge, actually hitting her in the throat. On top of the disqualification, he was stripped from prize money, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Quarter of a million dollars in prize money gone, a $10,000 fine, but he should never have been ejected from that tournament because of that. That was the wrong move. And it will put a big stain on the game of tennis. Now, nobody wants to watch the tournament.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it was -- it was done out of frustration, it looks like. But the USTA is saying that maybe it was intentional, which is just extraordinary.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you watch the video --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. It is the word on Wall Street -- go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Watch the video, it doesn't seem that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't seem intentional, back in a minute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In his most -influential position, eight years as the chair of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission until 2011, Samuel pursued and successfully prosecuted Australia's most famous cartel case against Richard Pratt's Visy Corporation. As a businessman in the 1980s, he bust open the stockbrokers fixed commissions. As the former head of the National Competition Council, he drove reforms for the national electricity market. As an AFL commissioner, he pushed for a national competition.</p><p>He was one of a three-member panel that recently delivered the damning review into the Commonwealth Bank. That review - which is now being passed around all of the boardrooms of Australia's biggest listed companies - should not be regarded a new blueprint for corporate governance, he insists. \"No. No, it's not a new benchmark. All it's doing is saying that this is the way that the panel thought proper corporate governance ought to operate and we found failings in the CBA at all levels.\" Samuel's latest role is in chairing Airlines for Australia and New Zealand, an airline lobby group determined to expose the gouging by airports both in the air and on land.</p><p>But right now, we sit down for a free-flowing talk on regulators,- -including the challenges facing Rod Sims with his controversial banking cartel case and judge Kenneth Hayne with the banking royal commission.</p><p>Many times Graeme Samuel comes back to the fundamental rules for the regulator, appointed under statute and the importance of sticking to the brief. And he calls out three \"really interesting diversions\" that can and do occur.</p><p>\"Number one: where the chair or the CEO gets drawn into the process of self-promotion\" he -explains. \"That so often happens when you get involved in international conferences, international organisations and the like. I know when I first started at the ACCC I was encouraged to get involved in these, particularly by my predecessor Alan Fels. I went to one meeting overseas and I thought this is a total waste of time for the ACCC! Yes, it might be good for me in terms of promotion, of profile on an international stage; you can feel good about that. But meanwhile there's activity occurring in Australia that really has to be dealt with.\" Does this mean it's not a good idea for ASIC chair Greg Medcraft to be on the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, spending chunks of time overseas?</p><p>\"It certainly diverts the attention of the chairman from the fundamental responsibility that is carrying out your responsibilities under the legislation. I'm wary of the relevance of doing those international type roles, particularly when you take on the head of IOSCO for example wary about the burden, the time commitment and the time it takes you from carrying out responsibilities under the legislation.</p><p>\"The second diversion,\" Samuel continues enthusiastically \"is that you get drawn into what I call the policy-making areas. Regulators love to be policymakers, they love to be thinking they're going to save the world and change policy. That's not their remit. That's why I've always been cautious about the conduct by regulators of market studies or market analysis.\" Wait a minute. Isn't the regulator in the perfect position to do work in this area? What about the landmark review that ACCC chairman Rod Sims is doing into digital platforms?</p><p>\"Frankly, I would have thought that was more appropriate to be dealt with by the Productivity Commission,\" Samuel says.</p><p>\"I noticed that Rod was quoted the other day as saying that this particular review is 'a lot of fun'. It's actually not a lot of fun, it a -serious issue and when you make a statement - and look it might have been a slip on his part - but when you make a statement that it's 'a lot of fun', it suggests that you're being diverted into areas that you really can get some fun and excitement out of when the real issue is enforcement of the law.\" I push again: surely, the digital platform review is a market competition issue? The ad revenue of traditional media is being hollowed out by Big Tech.</p><p>\"Of course the PC is well versed in competition issues, its fundamental economic philosophy is that of encouraging competition,\" Samuel says. \"Stephen King is one of its commissioners, he's a former member of the ACCC, probably Australia's best known and best organised -industrial organisation economist. They've got a lot of skills to be able to deal with those things and they do so in an environment where their remit is to look at policy. They seek and obtain submissions from ACCC, ASIC all other parties that might be relevant.\" At this point, my thoughts flash to an old rule in television: never say at the start I have three points to make. There are so many reasons why you might not finish the list. Not so here, however. \"Number three is the really significant one: a regulator, and particularly those that have to enforce the law, cannot feel the need to be liked. Now let me say industry is very adept at what I'll call industry capture, at getting regulators as part of their network. And they do it with lunches and dinners and inviting you to sporting events and the like - something I used to -resist an enormous amount -because it gave me the sense that what they were trying to do was to become so close to you, so friendly that you felt a constraint when it came to enforcing the law.</p><p>\"You cannot feel the need to be liked unless you want to sacrifice your primary remit - to act in the public interest. So sometimes you lose friends as a result. You lose -associations. You're seen as being a bit distant. But ultimately, that's the role of the regulator.\" 'I've lost some friends' Graeme Samuel has lost friends over his career. There was the spectacular falling out with Chris Corrigan, with whom he busted the broker commissions, only to later call for more competition at the ports where Corrigan was king. But the decisions that cost him most personally, and indeed divided the Melbourne Jewish community, was his pursuit of Richard Pratt in the cartel case against Visy. No one can deny that here, Samuel walked the walk.</p><p>\"There is no question that the whole Pratt/Visy exercise was personally very trying. I had significant representations from some people in the Melbourne community who said to me, 'Graeme, this is not the way we deal with these things. Can we fix this up? Can we mediate? And I said no you can't. This is a serious issue -involving cartel conduct. It will go before the courts and that's exactly what we did. And the court vindicated our approach. Yes, I lost some friends. I've still lost some, people that don't talk to me now.\" The low point for Samuel would surely be where his own business dealings were in question, where he had to defend the blind trust structure for his investments, one of which, a fashion business, went to the wall. \"The greatest complexity was that when those challenges arose, -people were using the media to try and put be under pressure and that's really difficult when you're in public office.\" As for penalties versus enforceable undertakings, Samuel sees value in both but that the more frequent use of criminal prosecutions will be far more important. \"I'll never forget getting the $37m cheque from Visy in respect of the cartel verdict from Justice Peter Heerey. I looked at the cheque and I've actually still got a photocopy at home, and it was signed by the finance director of Visy and I'm thinking, it doesn't really matter to Visy. What was really important was the publicity that occurred.\" Samuel has cited the strong language in the Heerey verdict and the crucial role played by the Victorian DPP that led to criminal charges against an ailing Richard Pratt, charges which were eventually quashed.</p><p>What then, does Samuel make of the current criminal charges against bankers, individuals as a result of Sims' ACCC cartel case against ANZ, Citigroup and Deutsche? And does he believe that ASIC and APRA will be brave enough also to bring more criminal action in future?</p><p>\"It has a massive impact on the market and the reverberations are being felt at the moment. You can imagine that there will be an enormous degree of caution about what is done in this area into the future. My understanding is that there has already been discussion between ASIC and the industry about this sort of behaviour, although it postdated the subject of this particular prosecution. But that discussion has been taking place and ASIC and ACCC has been talking to industry and saying, look, this can't continue, it has to change. We know ASIC is looking at this issue of disclosure.</p><p>\"My initiation reaction was a bit of a query because when you enter into joint underwritings there's no competition. And so therefore you can't have a cartel. But there's a point with joint underwritings, particularly once the issue has taken place where the joint arrangement if you like, ceases, when you have to deal with the shortfall. And then you might get into an issue of competition and potential collusiveness because that occurs there.\" Particularly when a retail deal comes straight after that placement one might ponder. Like the rest of us, Samuel waits to see just how the court will deal with this. But he stresses that while the ACCC is bringing on the case, no criminal prosecution can take place unless the DPP is satisfied both of reasonable grounds for success and that the prosecution is in the public interest.</p><p>\"Well, apparently the Commonwealth DPP is,\" I say. \"Well that's the point,\" he retorts.</p><p>Samuel's perspective on Kenneth Hayne and his royal commission is insightful. \"You got to remember: what we are going through is a series of eight \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I'll call them show trials. Eight theatres. Ken Hayne actually got all the information he needed at the very early stages, -because he asked for 50-page confessions from every organisation. And they had to confess, so he knows what has gone wrong, he knows all those issues. Now we're going through a series of two-weekly show trials. And they're good, except,\" he stresses \"except that they can raise expectations too high. So the first couple of show trials, AMP and one about CBA and credit card insurance, had people horrified that this was going on: a chair lost her role, some directors had to resign from AMP. Now what that does is, it says to the public at large there's a lot of horrific things happening.\"Ticky Fullerton presents Ticky at 5.30pm weeknights on Sky News Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-55c3250680ec11e8929a154fc80d50a4539292f6099760cd85559c6d4779f06b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR9-WB41-F0JP-W2DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000404</classCode><className>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTJGRkVBNjc4MzI3NDA5MTlEMDI1NjU2NzMyNkYzNTc</classCode><className>Corporate Governance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001149</classCode><className>MISCONDUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But meanwhile there's activity occurring in Australia that really has to be dealt with.\" Does this mean it's not a good idea for ASIC chair Greg Medcraft to be on the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, spending chunks of time overseas?</p><p>\"It certainly diverts the attention of the chairman from the fundamental responsibility that is carrying out your responsibilities under the legislation. I'm wary of the relevance of doing those international type roles, particularly when you take on the head of IOSCO for example wary about the burden, the time commitment and the time it takes you from carrying out responsibilities under the legislation.</p><p>\"The second diversion,\" Samuel continues enthusiastically \"is that you get drawn into what I call the policy-making areas. Regulators love to be policymakers, they love to be thinking they're going to save the world and change policy. That's not their remit. That's why I've always been cautious about the conduct by regulators of market studies or market analysis.\" Wait a minute. Isn't the regulator in the perfect position to do work in this area? What about the landmark review that ACCC chairman Rod Sims is doing into digital platforms?</p><p>\"Frankly, I would have thought that was more appropriate to be dealt with by the Productivity Commission,\" Samuel says.</p><p>\"I noticed that Rod was quoted the other day as saying that this particular review is 'a lot of fun'. It's actually not a lot of fun, it a -serious issue and when you make a statement - and look it might have been a slip on his part - but when you make a statement that it's 'a lot of fun', it suggests that you're being diverted into areas that you really can get some fun and excitement out of when the real issue is enforcement of the law.\" I push again: surely, the digital platform review is a market competition issue? The ad revenue of traditional media is being hollowed out by Big Tech.</p><p>\"Of course the PC is well versed in competition issues, its fundamental economic philosophy is that of encouraging competition,\" Samuel says. \"Stephen King is one of its commissioners, he's a former member of the ACCC, probably Australia's best known and best organised -industrial organisation economist. They've got a lot of skills to be able to deal with those things and they do so in an environment where their remit is to look at policy. They seek and obtain submissions from ACCC, ASIC all other parties that might be relevant.\" At this point, my thoughts flash to an old rule in television: never say at the start I have three points to make. There are so many reasons why you might not finish the list. Not so here, however. \"Number three is the really significant one: a regulator, and particularly those that have to enforce the law, cannot feel the need to be liked. Now let me say industry is very adept at what I'll call industry capture, at getting regulators as part of their network. And they do it with lunches and dinners and inviting you to sporting events and the like - something I used to -resist an enormous amount -because it gave me the sense that what they were trying to do was to become so close to you, so friendly that you felt a constraint when it came to enforcing the law.</p><p>\"You cannot feel the need to be liked unless you want to sacrifice your primary remit - to act in the public interest. So sometimes you lose friends as a result. You lose -associations. You're seen as being a bit distant. But ultimately, that's the role of the regulator.\" 'I've lost some friends' Graeme Samuel has lost friends over his career. There was the spectacular falling out with Chris Corrigan, with whom he busted the broker commissions, only to later call for more competition at the ports where Corrigan was king. But the decisions that cost him most personally, and indeed divided the Melbourne Jewish community, was his pursuit of Richard Pratt in the cartel case against Visy. No one can deny that here, Samuel walked the walk.</p><p>\"There is no question that the whole Pratt/Visy exercise was personally very trying. I had significant representations from some people in the Melbourne community who said to me, 'Graeme, this is not the way we deal with these things. Can we fix this up? Can we mediate? And I said no you can't. This is a serious issue -involving cartel conduct. It will go before the courts and that's exactly what we did. And the court vindicated our approach. Yes, I lost some friends. I've still lost some, people that don't talk to me now.\" The low point for Samuel would surely be where his own business dealings were in question, where he had to defend the blind trust structure for his investments, one of which, a fashion business, went to the wall. \"The greatest complexity was that when those challenges arose, -people were using the media to try and put be under pressure and that's really difficult when you're in public office.\" As for penalties versus enforceable undertakings, Samuel sees value in both but that the more frequent use of criminal prosecutions will be far more important. \"I'll never forget getting the $37m cheque from Visy in respect of the cartel verdict from Justice Peter Heerey. I looked at the cheque and I've actually still got a photocopy at home, and it was signed by the finance director of Visy and I'm thinking, it doesn't really matter to Visy. What was really important was the publicity that occurred.\" Samuel has cited the strong language in the Heerey verdict and the crucial role played by the Victorian DPP that led to criminal charges against an ailing Richard Pratt, charges which were eventually quashed.</p><p>What then, does Samuel make of the current criminal charges against bankers, individuals as a result of Sims' ACCC cartel case against ANZ, Citigroup and Deutsche? And does he believe that ASIC and APRA will be brave enough also to bring more criminal action in future?</p><p>\"It has a massive impact on the market and the reverberations are being felt at the moment. You can imagine that there will be an enormous degree of caution about what is done in this area into the future. My understanding is that there has already been discussion between ASIC and the industry about this sort of behaviour, although it postdated the subject of this particular prosecution. But that discussion has been taking place and ASIC and ACCC has been talking to industry and saying, look, this can't continue, it has to change. We know ASIC is looking at this issue of disclosure.</p><p>\"My initiation reaction was a bit of a query because when you enter into joint underwritings there's no competition. And so therefore you can't have a cartel. But there's a point with joint underwritings, particularly once the issue has taken place where the joint arrangement if you like, ceases, when you have to deal with the shortfall. And then you might get into an issue of competition and potential collusiveness because that occurs there.\" Particularly when a retail deal comes straight after that placement one might ponder. Like the rest of us, Samuel waits to see just how the court will deal with this. But he stresses that while the ACCC is bringing on the case, no criminal prosecution can take place unless the DPP is satisfied both of reasonable grounds for success and that the prosecution is in the public interest.</p><p>\"Well, apparently the Commonwealth DPP is,\" I say. \"Well that's the point,\" he retorts.</p><p>Samuel's perspective on Kenneth Hayne and his royal commission is insightful. \"You got to remember: what we are going through is a series of eight \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I'll call them show trials. Eight theatres. Ken Hayne actually got all the information he needed at the very early stages, -because he asked for 50-page confessions from every organisation. And they had to confess, so he knows what has gone wrong, he knows all those issues. Now we're going through a series of two-weekly show trials. And they're good, except,\" he stresses \"except that they can raise expectations too high. So the first couple of show trials, AMP and one about CBA and credit card insurance, had people horrified that this was going on: a chair lost her role, some directors had to resign from AMP. Now what that does is, it says to the public at large there's a lot of horrific things happening.\"Ticky Fullerton presents Ticky at 5.30pm weeknights on Sky News Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-55c3250680ec11e8929a154fc80d50a487c9f326814751b251023e2a126e4db5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SRS-0241-JD3N-52V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000404</classCode><className>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTJGRkVBNjc4MzI3NDA5MTlEMDI1NjU2NzMyNkYzNTc</classCode><className>Corporate Governance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001149</classCode><className>MISCONDUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N523120MC</classCode><className>SECURITIES BROKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google as a ''menace'' to society and calling for the companies to be regulated. </p><p>  Ms. Sandberg -- who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros's speech, according to a person who attended it -- requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>later commissioned a campaign-style opposition research effort by Definers Public Affairs, a Republican-linked firm, which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about Mr. Soros's funding of American advocacy groups critical of <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  Those efforts, revealed this month in a New York Times investigation, set off a public relations debacle for Ms. Sandberg and for <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>which was accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic attacks against the billionaire. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>quickly fired Definers.</p><p>  The people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg's email asked for anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.</p><p>  In a statement, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.</p><p>  ''Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to <person><nameText>Facebook,</nameText></person>'' the company said. ''That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>stock.'' The company said that while Ms. Sandberg ''takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,'' she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>an anti-<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers' later work.</p><p>  Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said he was skeptical of the company's account.</p><p>  ''In light of Sandberg's continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,'' Mr. Vale said. ''<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>coalition or any member organizations.''</p><p>  The revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg's shifting explanations of her role in <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network's growing legion of critics. Ms. Sandberg at first denied knowing that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had hired Definers, before acknowledging in a post last week that some of the company's work for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had crossed her desk.</p><p>  In that post, Ms. Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Mr. Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers' investigation into Mr. Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Ms. Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Mr. Soros.</p><p>  ''We had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,'' Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. ''Definers researched this using public information.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure -- particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound.</p><p>  But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.</p><p>  The Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.</p><p>  But it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company's critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.</p><p>  Some have called on Ms. Sandberg to be fired. Last week's admission by Mr. Schrage -- a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company -- was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.</p><p>  In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros.</p><p>  Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm's research.</p><p>  ''She very much placed it on the now departed communications chief'' -- Mr. Schrage -- ''and also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,'' Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Kaplan is the company's vice president of global public policy.</p><p>  Mr. Robinson said he was pleased Ms. Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>involvement with Definers, Mr. Robinson said, Ms. Sandberg kept stressing that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had fired the firm.</p><p>  ''We were not satisfied with that answer,'' he said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-388084181130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVK-Y6V1-DXY4-X1GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html</url><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He famously took his wife on a honeymoon to the Soviet Union in 1988 and set up sister-city programs with places such as Puerta Cabezas in Nicaragua and Yaroslavl in Russia.</p><p>In short, the bearded lady of American politics.</p><p>But nobody is dismissing him now.</p><p>Over the past decade, Sanders - who joined the Senate in 2007 after 16 years in the House of Representatives - has watched and benefited as a large slab of the Democrat base shifted in his direction.</p><p>Having narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, Sanders relaunched his bid for the presidency early last year and has stood out as the party's most organised and prolific fundraiser ever since.</p><p>Ideologically, Sanders says his way of seeing the world is no longer on the fringes and argues that his model for America isn't anything people in Scandinavia or many other parts of Europe would regard as radical.</p><p>\"Ideas that seemed radical four years ago are now kind of mainstream,\" he told the 60 Minutes on Sunday - the day after his thumping victory in the Nevada caucus.</p><p>The speed of that shift is coming as a shock to many on Wall Street, not the least because Sanders is riding a wave of grassroots fervour among mostly young voters who are buying into the senator's plans for an all-out assault on corporate America and its hard-charging model of capitalism.</p><p>As president, Sanders would reverse Trump's corporate tax cuts, returning the headline rate back up to its pre-2017 rate of 35 per cent, from 21 per cent, and lift the federal minimum wage to $US15 ($22.73) an hour.</p><p>Consistent with his campaign attacks on the \"billionaire class\", Sanders wants to introduce an \"extreme wealth tax\" on top-earning Americans alongside a national \"wealth registry\" to prevent tax avoidance.</p><p>Those with net worth north of $US32 million would pay 1 per cent, rising to a maximum of 8 per cent on wealth of more than $US$10 billion.</p><p>Sanders also wants to halt capital gains breaks for households with incomes above $US250,000, and believes there should be a tax on all Wall Street financial transactions.</p><p>Next would likely be what could become the largest trust-busting campaign in a century, targeting for a break-up of too-big-to-fail banks and big tech firms that together account for about a quarter of the S&amp;P's market value. His boldest promise by far would be the creation of a national healthcare scheme that would do away with private insurance that currently covers around 160 million Americans.</p><p>In its place would be a universal system that he says would cost less while extending coverage to more than 30 million people outside the system.</p><p>He has flagged a system in which workers with a family of four earning more than $US29,000 would pay a 4 per cent family premium on every dollar earned above that level.</p><p>It would save the average family paying private insurance $US4775 a year.</p><p>Employers would shift away from private premiums, which cost on average $US14,561 for a worker with a family of four, to a single 7.5 per cent payroll tax at a cost of $US4500.</p><p>Still, introducing \"Medicare for all\" would lift federal spending over the first decade by between $US32 trillion and $US34 trillion, according to calculations released by the Urban Institute, a centre-left think tank in Washington.</p><p>That number is greater than the American government's total cost over the same period for social security, Medicare and Medicaid - the nation's largest entitlement programs - according to Congressional Budget Office projections.</p><p>Another major Sanders proposal is to cancel all college debt and make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition free, which his campaign has costed at $US2.2 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>Then there are big-spending plans to provide \"housing for all\" ($US2.5 trillion over a decade) and universal childcare ($US1.5 trillion). Even if a hostile congress blocks much of the Sanders agenda, Trump's liberal use of executive orders has created a precedent for wide-ranging intervention across the economy.</p><p>Sanders has promised to introduce government regulations to curb emissions. He wants to ban fracking and supports shuttering existing nuclear power reactors and slash $US1.22 trillion from defence spending.</p><p>While his weekend Nevada caucus win triggered a sharp sell-off across US healthcare stocks, some analysts have argued that his plans could actually spur economic growth, at least for a time.</p><p>Plans for removing the burden of repaying university debt and providing a single-payer healthcare system could free up household resources for new spending and investment. Sanders also backs infrastructure investment and has expressed approval for a \"Green New Deal\" splurge on high-speed rail, electric transport and more public options to cut emissions.</p><p>\"Wall Street's getting nervous, the insurance industry's getting nervous, drug companies are getting nervous, and the Democratic establishment is getting nervous,\" Sanders reportedly told supporters in recent days.</p><p>Scaramucci suggests the Sanders resurgence is linked to deteriorating income inequality caused by the same interest rate cuts Trump has so vociferously demanded of the US Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"The great irony of the interest rate activity and the co-ordination of the Federal Reserve with the global banks is that it's having a very big effect on populism, the spectre of nationalism and all this other stuff,\" he told The Australian Financial Review. \"The rich have gotten way richer. \"</p><p>The result is a pending battle between a \"radical, oligarchic right-wing figure in Donald Trump, that's going to be going up against a first-time, self-declared American socialist\".</p><p>\"I would tell you right now: don't underestimate the passion and the angry disaffected people who feel disadvantaged by the elites and the establishment that could potentially side with a guy like Bernie Sanders,\" Scaramucci said.</p><p>So far, Trump appears to relish the idea of a Sanders nomination, applauding the senator's Nevada win and urging him to fight against the Democratic Party machine's desire to install a moderate.</p><p>Clearly, it's because many Republicans believe Sanders will be an easy beat once they've pilloried him as a dangerous socialist radical desperate to impose a Venezuelan hell-scape on the American people.</p><p>While there's every chance that strategy will work for Trump come November, there's a risk for the President that just enough Americans in the key swing states might go for the Sanders plan, assuming he gets the nomination.</p><p>Sanders is no Jeremy Corbyn, the failed British Labour leader whose plan included genuine socialism, such as the nationalisation of railways, electricity distribution, the post office, and water utilities.</p><p>But he still seems radical by conventional American standards. If that's still a thing.

With the election for San Francisco mayor less than three weeks away, many residents are focused on how the candidates will fix the housing crisis. For some candidates, that means asking the tech industry to answer for gentrification and the impact it's had on the real estate market. San Francisco is in trouble. </p><p>The streets[1] are filthy. Housing prices are out-of-control. The city is host to 1.23% ofallhomeless Americans[2]. Some San Franciscans are fed up with the tech industry, which they blame for gentrification and the still-painful housing crisis. They want a reckoning to come for Big Tech \u2014 courtesy of the next mayor. San Francisco elects a new mayor in less than three weeks, and the candidates are battling over the best path to regulate the tech industry and its presence in the city. The top contenders are expected to take a harder line with the tech companies that have sprouted throughout the city, thanks to generous tax breaks and other favorable policies. The era of tech-friendly civic policy in San Francisco may be coming to an end. Seven mayoral candidates met for one final debate on Monday evening at the Commonwealth Club. During the last portion of the debate, the moderator read questions from the audience, ranging in topic from the city's homelessness[3] epidemic to the onslaught of electric scooters[4]. \"Why is the rent so damn high[5]?\" the moderator read from a card. The room broke out in laughter that quickly subsided, as an audience of about 200 people waited to hear how their next mayor plans to reckon with out-of-control housing prices. San Francisco is in the thralls of a housing emergency. The median two-bedroom rent[6] of $3,060 is more than double the national average of $1,170, and only 12%[7] of families can afford to buy a home in the city. Lower-income residents[8] are leaving in droves, as tech and finance professionals migrate into the city for high-paying jobs, driving housing prices even higher. Audience questions during the debate made it clear, if it weren't before: Some residents are fed up with what they see as the tech industry leeching off their city, and they want the next mayor to force Big Tech to pay up. Candidate Mark Leno, a former California state senator, called on tech companies to hire more residents for jobs in administrative offices and sales. He cited the number of college-educated San Franciscans driving taxis to suggest that underemployment is something tech can solve. \"We need to make sure that [the tech industry's] success is our success,\" Leno said.Supervisor Jane Kim, who's also running for mayor, came down on the tech industry for \"their role in exacerbating the income gap,\" which she called the fastest-growing[9] in the country. San Francisco's middle class shrank from about half the population[10] in the 1990s to about 33%[11] in 2012. She suggested that local government work together with the tech industry to address how these companies \"treat their lowest-paid workers.\" She asked, \"What benefits do they provide them?\" Kim went on, \"Can they stop contracting out [...] so that our janitors, our cafeteria workers, our security guards have security to live in the Bay Area and be able to raise their families here?\" Candidate Ellen Lee Zhou, a public health worker and union representative considered to be an underdog, asked that the tech industry considered \"supplying their own apartments for their own employees.\" As mayor, she said she would ask tech companies to donate buildings for developing affordable housing. People from the audience asked the candidates to address the insane traffic jams that residents face downtown, where some6,500 Uber and Lyft cars[12] roam the streets during peak hours. Richie Greenberg, a small business adviser and the only Republican in the race, and San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed \u2014 who served as acting mayor briefly after the sudden death of previous mayor Ed Lee \u2014 both said they would place a cap on the number of ride-hailing cars permitted on the road at any time. Breed went a step further, saying she would curb some vehicles with on-demand startups like Postmates and Caviar to reduce congestion. San Francisco will vote on June 5 \u2014 the same day as the statewide California elections.

Lee is considered largely responsible for bolstering the city's economy by ushering in the post-recession tech boom. Lee faced past controversy regarding San Francisco's increased gentrification and punishing housing market. With his passing, it's possible that city candidates might take a tougher stance on the tech industry.\u00a0 The tech industry's cozy status as San Francisco's most favored group could be on its way out as a new group of politicians jockey for the vacant mayor's seat following the sudden death of Ed Lee last week.\u00a0[1] Two of the top contenders for the job, Acting Mayor London Breed and former State Senator Mark Leno, are both expected to take a tougher line with the tech firms that have sprouted throughout the city thanks to generous tax breaks and other favorable policies. </p><p>Although none of the major contenders for the mayor's job have been outright antagonistic towards tech, they've shown a willingness to be less accommodating than Lee. And with the city's housing crisis throbbing, and ongoing debate about the effect of gentrification and \"tech bros\" on San Francisco's infrastructure, affordability and culture, the days of hands-off treatment for tech may be coming to an end. \"What\u00a0you'll see is a less friendly environment, more scrutiny, and possibly less of an appetite for a tax break ever again,\" a longtime San Francisco political consultant told Business Insider. \"As these companies mature, and as the city matures, the policy discussions are going to become a little less one-sided, and a little bit more about what the companies need to do in order to behave,\" the consultant, who declined to be identified, added.\u00a0 A special election to choose the new mayor will take place in June 2018. Until then the city's board of supervisors must agree on an interim Mayor to serve as a caretaker.\u00a0 Breed, until recently the president of the city's board of supervisors, is viewed as one of the favorites for the June election, although she has yet to official declare her intention to run.\u00a0 A 43-year old San Francisco native who grew up in public housing, Breed has turned critical eye on the city's tech industry in the past \u2014 a stance which put her at political odds with Mayor Lee. Last year, she co-sponsored a bill[2] which proposed a strict 60-day-per-year limit on short-term rentals in a direct response to Airbnb's largely unregulated influence on the city's housing and hotel markets. Lee vetoed the bill, saying that it would only drive more homeowners to rent their properties illegally. In 2016, Breed centered her supervisor re-election campaign on building and protecting affordable housing, a crucial issue in a city where the median cost of rent has soared to $4,450 a month[3]. The city's punishing housing market is considered a direct result of the influx of high-wage earning tech workers, and Breed has described [4]her resolve to fight towards tenants rights as a \"personal matter.\" It's a stance that could cause tension with big tech, which until now has comfortably sprawled throughout the downtown districts, both commercially[5] and residentially[6].\u00a0\"Your success has also created tension\"That's not to say that Breed is inherently opposed to tech or unwilling to collaborate with the industry. Appearing at the 2015 \"Crunchies\" awards organized by tech blog TechCrunch[7], Breed said she had \"great respect for the tech sector, for the dreamers and entrepreneurs who want to create something new, something innovative.\" But, she added, \"right or wrong, your success has also created tension.\"\u00a0 \"It's time for us to work together and make sure every San Franciscan shares in the prosperity,\" she said. The race to replace Lee, who died on Tuesday after seven years in office as San Francisco's mayor, comes as San Francisco struggles to adapt to the rapid changes bought by the tech industry.\u00a0Only last week, the board unanimously approved stringent regulations on delivery robots that ride on city sidewalks[8].\u00a0 Lee oversaw San Francisco through a time of severe economic upheaval following the recession [9]and played an integral role in fostering San Francisco's developing tech industry. During his time as mayor, he provided generous tax incentives to tech companies[10], held close relationships with prominent venture capitalists[11], and took an active interest in nurturing the city's burgeoning start-up scene[12].\u00a0 Mark Leno,\u00a0who had already declared his intention to run for Mayor after Lee's term expired[13],\u00a0has been critical of Lee's accommodating stance toward tech. 'As mayor, I'll fight on behalf of regular San Franciscans \u2014\u00a0immigrants, tenants, homeowners\u00a0and small businesses. I promise to give a voice to every resident of our city \u2014\u00a0especially to those who feel marginalized or left behind,\" he told the LA Times in May.[14] Like Breed, Leno is focused on the city's housing market,\u00a0spearheading a bill protecting tenants rights in 2015[15].\u00a0And he has approved of tighter tech regulations in the past. In 2014, Leno authored the smart phone \"kill switch bill\" which called for antitheft security features [16]to be included in smartphones.\u00a0 Leno and Breed did not return requests for comment on their views about tech.\u00a0Tech 'hasn't paid its fair share' While tech figures, such as investor Ron Conway, were big supporters of Lee's, the mayor's stance towards the tech industry was criticized by many city residents. In November, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Lee's approval ratings had sunk [17]to just 30 percent. \"The tech industry hasn't paid its fair share and has contributed to the displacement of low-income communities, seniors and our most vulnerable,\" Gilbert Williams, a member of the grassroots activist group Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment told Business Insider in an email.\u00a0 \"We would hope\u00a0the new mayor took the tech industry's enormous wealth, and used it to help create a permanent anti-displacement fund that includes immediate solutions for renters and homeowners,\" he said.NOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories[18]See Also: I've worked in tech for 22 years \u2014 and it's clear we're living in an 'addiction

And a lot of people would like to see. And that very much affects the working -- the workers of our country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO: President Trump also taking aim at the Federal Reserve, saying that they have been tardy when it comes to cutting interest rates. He's calling for a full percent cut, maybe not all at once, but over time.</p><p>Not helping stocks today. Market closing at the lows right now, down 170 points on the Dow industrials.</p><p>Welcome, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo, in today for Neil Cavuto. This is YOUR WORLD.</p><p>John Roberts at the White House right now, where it all is going down.</p><p>John, good afternoon.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good afternoon to you.</p><p>President Trump had a lot to talk about today. We were in the Oval Office for about 30 minutes going over a number of different topics. But first and foremost, of course, was where we are with the economy and where we're headed.</p><p>There's an old saying that if you talk your -- talk about recession enough, you can talk your way into one. So the president didn't want to talk about recession. He wanted to talk about things that he believes that he might be able to do, and specifically things that the Fed could do to stop us from going into one.</p><p>Listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the word recession is a word that's inappropriate, because it's just a word that the certain people -- I'm going to be kind.</p><p>Certain people and the media are trying to build up, because they'd love to see a recession.</p><p>We're very far from a recession. In fact, if the Fed would do its job, I think we would have a tremendous spurt of growth, a tremendous spurt.</p><p>The Fed is psychologically very important, less so actually, but very psychologically important. And if the Fed would do it's job, which it's really done poorly over the last year-and-a-half, you would see a burst of growth like you have never seen before.</p><p>And that would be lowering interest rates.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: The president very critical of Jerome Powell and what the Fed has been doing, believing that they overshot the mark last year, that they raised interest rates too quickly, too fast -- too quickly, too fast, that would be the same thing -- too high, too quickly.</p><p>And he doesn't like their program of quantitative tightening. So the president is calling -- called again day in the Oval Office for a cut in the Fed Funds Rate of 100 basis points. That would be a full percentage rate cut, which would take it down to the area of about 1 percent.</p><p>The president said, now, not all at once. But then he would also like to see some quantitative easing as well, which we saw during the Obama administration.</p><p>Another thing that the president is thinking about, Maria, is indexing capital gains. It's very popular among a lot of people who tend to be wealthy who have a lot of investments in the market, and also considering another potential cut to the payroll tax.</p><p>This happened in 2011 and 2012 as part of the economic stimulus in the Obama administration. And that is a tax cut that really affects the middle class, because you cap out at about $95,000. And people who make more than that per year don't get the tax cut. So the tax cut goes to people between about $30,000 and $95,000, which is squarely in the middle class.</p><p>Listen to what the president said about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Payroll taxes, I have been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time. Whether or not we do it now or not is -- it's not being done because of recession, because we are -- legitimately, if we had a cut in interest rates by the Fed, if they would do their job properly, and if they would do a meaningful cut, because they raised too fast, you would see growth like you have not seen ever in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You're probably detecting a them there. Even though the president was talking about tax cuts, he came back to the idea of the Fed needing to cut rates and needing to inject some more money into the system as well to keep the economy humming along.</p><p>China, Maria, is also a big piece of this. The president again said today that he is not yet ready to cut a deal with China. And he said whether or not there is short-term pain because of his negotiations with China and his policy of tariffs against China to try to bring them to the table is irrelevant.</p><p>He says we might need some short-term pain because long term if we don't do something about China, it's going to be catastrophic, because they will eat our lunch five to 10 years from now -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they have said that's where they want to go.</p><p>John, thank you so much.</p><p>So is a big rate cut and a middle-class tax cut what's needed to keep this economy moving forward?</p><p>Let's bring in former Dallas Federal Reserve adviser Danielle DiMartino Booth and market watchers Scott Martin and Lee Munson.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>Danielle, let me kick it off with you. Your reaction to a full cut by the Federal Reserve and potentially a cut in payroll taxes?</p><p>DANIELLE DIMARTINO BOOTH, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE ADVISER: Well, it looks like the president is hoping that the country can go out there double- barreled and answer what the European Central Bank, what the Europeans have been promised, which is basically rate cuts and quantitative easing.</p><p>He wants to put some fiscal stimulus on top of that that really targets the middle class, and then capital gains tax cuts as well to hold the stock market together. So it really does seem like a perfect Goldilocks scenario, if he was able to wave a magic wand and make this happen overnight.</p><p>I don't know how willing Jay Powell and his peers are going to be to launch that type of a shock and awe campaign that was really emblematic of some of the -- some of the crisis years, when the economy was truly in much more than a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Scott Martin, how do you see it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, it's funny.</p><p>I mean, talking about '07, and I remember that fall very well. I got married that fall. And other than that event, it was a really bad fall, because, to Danielle's point, the Fed was cutting rates faster than we could even see them being cut.</p><p>And it didn't help. We went into a major financial crisis. And that's what I think worries me here with the Fed on the other side now, as the Trump -- as the president has pointed out, is that they raised too fast. I think they have been too hawkish.</p><p>Even when we got the cut recently at the end of July, Maria, says, well, this is a mid-cycle adjustment, don't get used to this, we're not going to be this nice.</p><p>So it still -- it still to me boggles my mind that you have the 30-year government bond, my friends a skosh over 2 percent. The Fed Funds' overnight target rate at 2.25 percent, that tells you it's too high.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: They need to listen to the markets, not the president, and cut some more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, look at the 10-year, where that is. I mean, it's just extraordinary, what you're -- what we're looking at here, Lee Munson.</p><p>Your reaction. Do you want to see a cut?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: I want to see a cut. And I will tell you why.</p><p>I mean, you ask a lot of bond traders right now, they already think that we're going to see three cuts, maybe 75 basis points, before the end of the year. So the president's not that far off. Number two, I think this is going to be something that's going to help farmers.</p><p>I mean, I'm in New Mexico. You go down to Southern New Mexico, and you see land fallow right now. It's going to help drillers in the energy sector that are overleveraged and can use it. And you have also got to look at local regional banks. They need this right now.</p><p>What people don't understand Maria is that we have with China intertwined trade and national security issues. I do a lot of business with people in national defense. We have got to deal with this Chinese thing. And the president says he will push this economy into recession to deal with that.</p><p>Unlike the Russians, unlike the Soviets, money talks with China, and so I think that we're going to have the guns-and-butter approach. We got to juice this system for the next 12 months so that Trump can get these issues with China worked out.</p><p>Again, I'm fiscally conservative, but we have got to address the intellectual property, thievery, the military espionage, Huawei, all that stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN: All the things they won't agree on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: These are all the things that they reneged on.</p><p>So -- and, by the way, let's not forget that China has broken its promises so many times in so many different situations, whether it's the WTO, or breaking promises with Hong Kong. Look with the two million people in the streets as we speak. Breaking promises with the U.S., saying that they're going to buy beef, and then they don't.</p><p>So even if we were to see a deal, will it be enforceable?</p><p>DIMARTINO BOOTH: Well, I think that, Maria, that's fantastic question, because we have seen them renege and go back on their word time and again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>DIMARTINO BOOTH: We have seen the way that they're treating the people in Hong Kong. They're simply not a trustworthy negotiating partner.</p><p>And I think that there's every reason to question the integrity of China's intentions at this juncture. What I'm not sure about is whether or not tariffs are the correct instrument anymore. And I think that President Trump has seen that and he pulled back on those September the 1st increased tariffs for that very reason.</p><p>And now he's looking for a different way to go about providing relief to this economy, so that it can get through, so that his administration can get through these very tough negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the issue is that the economy feels good.</p><p>But, at the end of the day, we are seeing a bit of a slowdown. We know that Europe is having a hard time generating any growth.</p><p>So what about that, Scott? Do you feel things are poised to slow down considerably by year-end?</p><p>MARTIN: I don't know about considerably. I think the slowdown has already begun.</p><p>I mean, I think -- you mentioned it. It's overseas. It's definitely in the U.S. The housing market, I know homebuilder sentiment is good, but housing prices, from my eye, in certain areas that have been good have slowed down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: Home buyer sentiment has kind of cooled off. We have seen business sentiment waver a bit. Consumer sentiment recently fell off some highs.</p><p>So I think a slowdown is imminent, if not here already, Maria. But, yes, it's not a major slowdown, but one that needs to be helped along a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee Munson, real quick, would you buy into this sell-off or stay on the sidelines here?</p><p>MUNSON: Buy in the sell-off. Buy what's beaten up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MUNSON: We have got 12 more months. And I think the next six months, you buy every dip that you have, and then you start getting concerned. But between now and the end of the year, I think you have to be bold and then - - then I start to get more panicky and freaked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much to the panel. Great conversation there.</p><p>History says, if the economy is good, there is a good chance that the incumbent president gets four more years. So do some new economic jitters have the White House feeling jittery itself?</p><p>We will talk to Karl Rove when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We heard earlier President Trump saying that some of the media are talking down the economy ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>Want to get that read on the -- on that with the former White House deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.</p><p>Karl, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there is something to say about that, that you could talk yourself into a recession, right? How do you see it?</p><p>ROVE: Yes, look, it's interesting how the narrative changes.</p><p>I mean, we have the economy is going really great, and now doubts about where Europe is or doubts about where the world is suddenly become a tempest of conversation in the media about the recession happening before the 2020 election and this affecting the president's reelection chances.</p><p>If a recession were to happen, and it were to happen before the 2020 election, sure kit would have an impact upon the president's reelection. On the other hand, we don't know when the next recession is going to begin.</p><p>And I saw that study the other day of economists in which opinion was split whether there might be recession in 2020 or 2021 or not at all...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROVE: ... in that time frame.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's all speculation.</p><p>ROVE: And so, look, all speculation.</p><p>And I saw. It was interesting. The president today said that he wasn't contemplating at this time a cut in the payroll taxes. And yet, since Monday, this has been a sort of storm of attention, oh, the administration is so worried about it, they're considering a payroll tax cut.</p><p>Well, the first time we heard it addressed by somebody in the administration was the president, and he said, we're always thinking about tax cuts, but we're not thinking about that tax cut right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So what about that?</p><p>I mean, you don't -- so, in other words, you're saying that this is all more speculation, that there's no tax cuts coming, because that would create more worries over the debt, you know that, if we were to...</p><p>ROVE: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Absolutely.</p><p>And it would also -- look, though. With a Democrat House bent upon impeaching the president, let's not kid ourselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROVE: The announcement yesterday by the number four ranking Democrat in the House leadership that he's in favor of impeachment, Jerry Nadler declaring, we don't care whether we have got a resolution of the House empowering us to move forward on our impeachment investigation.</p><p>We have a formal impeachment investigation going on -- going right now. Who thinks that a proposal to cut taxes from the administration would get a fair hearing or any hearing in the House of Representatives whatsoever?</p><p>So better for the president to think about the things that he can do to help strengthen people's confidence in the economy and administrative actions he can take they will add to our prosperity.</p><p>And it would be, in my opinion, a mistake to say, in order to keep us from getting into financial difficulty, in order for us to keep the economy growing, I have got to ask the House of Representatives to do X, because they ain't doing X, whatever it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Well, you make a good point, because this is where it really moves into politics, because the truth is, is the subject of unemployment is not a good subject for the Democratic candidates, because we are at a 51-year low in unemployment.</p><p>ROVE: No. That's right. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Growth is not even a good subject, because we are looking at better than 2 percent growth in the second quarter and 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter.</p><p>ROVE: Well, and then wages, because, remember, under the last two years of the Obama administration...</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then wages. Good point.</p><p>ROVE: Yes, under the last two years of the Obama administration, wages were rising for supervisors more than the working people underneath them.</p><p>I think it was about 75 percent more. In the last two years, I think the number is that wages for working people have been rising at a rate 40 percent higher than those for their supervisors.</p><p>So we have had the turn in the right direction we want, which is the work and people finally get an increase in their salaries and their wages. And people feel that in the pockets.</p><p>That's why I love all this gloom and doom. People say, oh, the economy is slowing up. The economy is turning down. And then we got the July consumer numbers, and what did they say? That the consumers had confidence in -- in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Same with small business. They seem to have confidence in the economy.</p><p>So, yes, you can you can talk yourself into a recession. You can claim -- you can claim, yes, we're there and find yourself there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: But until the American people begin to believe that they have got to somehow sort of shut things down, it ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know...</p><p>ROVE: What was interesting to me was in July that not only were consumers spending, but consumers were saving.</p><p>They were looking at what they were getting in the way of increased wages and saying, I want to spend a little bit more to make my wife -- my wife's family -- my family's life better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: But they also said, we're going to save a little bit more in order to make our family's life better over the long haul.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the savings rate did go up. You're right.</p><p>ROVE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, look, I think it's the level of interest rates that has everybody unnerved, because they're so low. What do you want to see the president focus on then going into 2020?</p><p>He's a business president, first business president. Do you think he should be focused on economic issues?</p><p>ROVE: Well, I think, yes. I think he ought to, because it's the number one issue that people have, the economy.</p><p>If the economy is with you, let's be honest, it doesn't help you as much as it hurts you when the economy is going against you. But it's something where the president's job approval on the handling of the economy has consistently been eight, 10, 11, 12 points ahead of his overall job approval.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: So it's a strength.</p><p>It's also a point of contrast, because, remember, all of these smart people who are running for president as Democrats said, if we have deregulation, if we have a businessman in charge, if we cut taxes, the economy is going to fall into a deep depression.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: And that didn't happen, all those forecasts of how bad it was going to be if we did what Donald Trump said.</p><p>So now Donald Trump is able to say, look what's happened under my -- on my watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>ROVE: And look at all these ideas on the other side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Look at what they're attempting to do.</p><p>Now, the important part is he has to have one other thing -- three things. Here's what I have done. Here's what the other side wants to do. But he's also got to say, here's the next round of things that I want to do to make the prosperity of America stronger and more durable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's got to look forward. They want to raise taxes, by the way.</p><p>ROVE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Karl. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROVE: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.</p><p>ROVE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders continuing his Iowa blitz, talking to voters at an ice cream social today, this coming as one of his 2020 rivals is starting to melt in the polls. We have got the scope right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Another big day for the Democrats in Iowa, with several 2020 hopefuls making their pitch across the state. Now some new numbers show a bit of a shakeup in the race.</p><p>According to a CNN poll released today, former Vice President Joe Biden has increased his lead. He's polling near 30 percent. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris making the biggest move in this poll, and it is not good. She's dropped to 5 percent. That's down from 17.</p><p>FOX News's Peter Doocy is blitzing Iowa with the candidates -- Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, over my right shoulder, you can see the former Vice President Joe Biden speaking for the first time after a few days on vacation and behind closed doors at fund-raisers.</p><p>He has a little bit more energy than normal. Maybe that's a result of all the rest from the last couple weeks. But something else that is new for an outdoor event for the former vice president, he is reading off of a teleprompter.</p><p>And that does, of course, follow a few days of stories citing anonymous Democratic donors wondering if there is anything that the campaign should be doing differently to avoid some of the gaffes or missteps at the microphone that have caught a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>But, regardless, despite all that, Joe Biden does still have that big lead. And his campaign's first commercial in Iowa that dropped today focuses on his position in the polls as paramount to any position on any kind of policy, which puts his approach at odds with the candidate right behind him in that new CNN poll, Bernie Sanders, who almost never breaks from a script where he preaches the value of Medicare for all to play softball, and to show potential caucus-goers the softer side of Bernie Sanders at the field of dreams.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Obviously, this campaign, very different than the last time, is, instead of two candidates yet, we have 23 or so.</p><p>So no one's going to get 50 percent. I think it's going to be a fight to get 25, 30 percent. But I think we're in that fight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: And I was just inside on this deck where Joe Biden is speaking.</p><p>It's worth pointing out, as we try to figure out which candidates are generating the most excitement in early states like Iowa, it's a smaller venue, and there are a lot of empty seats in the back -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>All right, Peter, thank you.</p><p>You're mentioning Joe Biden rolling out his first Iowa campaign today. Turns out the former V.P. is not rolling in the cash either, at least from smaller online donations. Politico is reporting that Biden' focus on big- money fund-raisers could be backfiring.</p><p>Let's get the read now from American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Larsen, Democratic strategist Robert Patillo.</p><p>Good to see you all. Thanks for being here.</p><p>Robert, what do you make of all this?</p><p>ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think what we're seeing is that Joe Biden right now, if you take Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' poll numbers and combine them, they would tie Joe Biden.</p><p>So I don't believe what Bernie Sanders said about no candidate getting 50 percent. Joe Biden wants the field to start narrowing down from 25 candidates, let's say, to the top five, could very well win this early on in the primary season.</p><p>So let's understand the Biden strategy of not going to the far left, to concentrate on kitchen table issues, on focusing on the economy, on health care, on national security is working.</p><p>And despite what some in the media are trying to push as this leftward socialist leaning of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden's the real center of the party. That's showing in the poll numbers. And it's showing in his lead in the race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe, but he's talking about Medicare for all when he talks about health care.</p><p>Ned, is it working?</p><p>NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY: No.</p><p>I mean, here's the fact, Maria. I think Joe Biden's far more of a paper tiger than people are willing to admit. I mean, cash on hand, he's trailing. You look at the small-dollar donor base, as you mentioned, I mean, back in June, Mayor Pete beat him by a 3-1 advantage on small-dollar donations.</p><p>He was mediocre in the first two debates. He just stumbled his way across Iowa. And the entire premise of Biden is that somehow America is yearning for a return to establishment normalcy.</p><p>And I have to tell you, Maria, America is not yearning for this return to establishment normalcy that wants to sell them out on trade, sell them out on immigration, raise their taxes, snap back to an administrative state run by a ruling class that doesn't prioritize the American people's interests.</p><p>And that's what you get with Joe Biden. I don't see the premise or the appeal. And I have to tell you, as we continue on, I don't see Joe Biden actually winning this nomination, as much as the poll numbers might show right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, he's definitely in the lead.</p><p>But, Emily, are you surprised that he is where he is? And what about Elizabeth Warren? She's really moving up.</p><p>EMILY LARSEN, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Sure.</p><p>Certainly, Elizabeth Warren just had an event where she had 12,000 people come out to see her, which is certainly the biggest of her campaign.</p><p>And I was just in South Carolina this weekend, and she had about almost 1,000 people at her event, while Bernie Sanders had about a third of that the next day in South Carolina. So she is certainly surging.</p><p>But one thing about Joe Biden's fund-raising that's interesting is that he really hasn't followed the pattern of some of these other candidates where they have peaks at the end of fund-raising quarters or at key events like debates or televised town halls.</p><p>And he's sort of had lackluster support, at least among those small grassroots donors, which could be a troubling sign for his campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When do you expect will see a real narrowing of this field?</p><p>LARSEN: Well, the debates will certainly narrow down the field.</p><p>We're going to have probably 10 or 11 candidates in September. There could be a few more in October. But as the debates start to whittle down the field, a lot of the lower-tier candidates will start to fall off, and especially after Iowa.</p><p>I think that's -- a lot of candidates seem to be maybe trying to hang on until Iowa and see how they do. There's a lot of fluctuation in some of the polling right now. And I think they're just waiting to see what happens then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Robert, how do you see it? What do you -- what do you -- how was your reaction to what you're hearing?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, one thing people have to understand is that when you have 25 people in a presidential field, the money's going to be finite.</p><p>Bernie Sanders still has a great online base of young donors who donate small amounts online. Joe Biden's going for the more establishment.</p><p>Once we get the field down after Labor Day, once it goes down to 15, and then 10 and then five, you will see the fund-raising come back for Joe Biden. He is the odds-on favorite, the 2-1 favorite to win right now. So I don't think anything's going to shake that up right as of this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think President Obama hasn't endorsed Biden?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, he doesn't want put his finger on the scales right now. We're still early in the season.</p><p>We're almost a year, year-and-a-half out from the primary. So as the field narrows down, once we get closer to the convention, then we will see President Obama step in. But he's not going to put his finger on the scale right now this early in the race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, everybody, great conversation. We so appreciate your time. Thank you. We will see you soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, more big trouble for big tech. Industry titans could be facing a new antitrust probe.</p><p>More on that right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: San Francisco to flyers: Put that plastic down.</p><p>Find out how the airport in the City by the Bay is making travelers get their water in new ways. We report, you might hide.</p><p>We're back in 60 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Big tech is back in the spotlight, as the Justice Department says it is working with a group of state attorneys general on an antitrust investigation into the industry, this coming after the DOJ launched its own review of tech giants like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Is all of this scrutiny justified?</p><p>Cybersecurity expert and attorney Leeza Garber is here now with me to talk more about that.</p><p>So, what do you think?</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You too.</p><p>GARBER: This is a hugely expanding issue. And we have different parts of the United States federal and state government looking into what Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google are doing.</p><p>And this comes on the heels of the E.U. already investigating these kind of antitrust actions. And it's so important that we -- important that we do this to protect consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I mean, well, look, the competition is slim when you look at competitors to a Google. Google has, what, 90 percent of market share in search.</p><p>GARBER: There are no competitors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GARBER: Yes, that's the funny thing. I mean, you look at it, there's really no feasible alternative to Facebook. Basically, if you're on a social media platform, you're on Facebook, since they acquired Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>How do you control something like that? It's a behemoth. But at the same time, the way our antitrust law is written, there's really no fiscal part to that for consumers, because it's -- quote, unquote -- \"technically free,\" even though they're trafficking in our data.</p><p>So it's very difficult to apply these laws to these kind of conceptual tech giants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I remember back in the day when Microsoft was the target of antitrust regulators because it was so big and also a similar situation in terms of its competitive reach.</p><p>It was heavy fines, it was a lot of backlash. The investors reacted. Is that what you're expecting here? Do you think investors start reacting? How significant will this be for these companies?</p><p>GARBER: It's going to be significant.</p><p>But, in general, the scale of what's significant is changing, right? Because you look at the FTC fine for Facebook's privacy violations, which was $5 billion, some people called it astounding and influential. Some people called it a drop in the bucket, because, compared to their -- their proceeds and everything else, it's a very minimal percentage, and it's really a slap on the wrist.</p><p>So how we go about kind of handling these antitrust issues, there are lots of different ways it could occur, but it definitely will have some sort of fiscal effect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder if it's, in addition to antitrust, you also have the conversation of conservatives getting censored and whether or not that's part of the -- of the upset on the part of regulators in Washington.</p><p>Certainly, the president has spoken about this.</p><p>GARBER: Definitely.</p><p>And you touch on a really important point, which is for so many of these giants, we can't see the inner goings-on of Google and how they rank these results. We can't see what Facebook is really doing with our data. And that's part of the problem as well.</p><p>Antitrust actions might help with maybe dismantling some of these things. What does that look like? Maybe it's unbundling acquisitions like Facebook from WhatsApp or Instagram.</p><p>But, for Amazon, for instance, it's selling platform. They're also selling their own goods. So there are all these different ways to look at it. But Google definitely will have to deal with the bias problem as a separate issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will tell you, Europe has been so much more significant in terms of its oversight and heavy-handedness, as opposed to the U.S.</p><p>GARBER: Definitely.</p><p>It's because, last year, they enacted the General Data Protective Regulation, the GDPR. They really look at privacy as a human right, like Apple always likes to say, although they have come into some problems with that issue recently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GARBER: But the E.U. has definitely led the way in terms of protecting user privacy and protecting consumers online.</p><p>And that's what the U.S. really needs to catch up to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we will see if the U.S. ends up getting close to where Europe is. That would be significant for these companies. That would be a big deal, a negative.</p><p>GARBER: It would be a huge deal.</p><p>But it's going to take a really long time. And what that's going to look like, it's still really up in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Leeza, it's great to see you.</p><p>GARBER: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>GARBER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love having you.</p><p>All right. Meanwhile, the FBI says that they released all the communication they had between the bureau and ex-British spy Christopher Steele. A federal judge just told them to keep on digging.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A federal judge has ordered the FBI to look for more communication between the FBI and the ex-British spy Christopher Steele.</p><p>Steele's dossier, of course, was used by the FBI to justify the surveillance of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.</p><p>Former DOJ prosecutor with me now, Doug Burns.</p><p>Doug, it's great to see you.</p><p>DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>BURNS: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you think? Are they going to come up with these documents? Or are they going to keep sitting on these documents?</p><p>BURNS: Well, it's a victory for Judicial Watch, obviously, and it's a victory for those who want to get to the bottom of what happened.</p><p>But to your question, which I'm not dodging, it's still an open question how many documents they are actually going to get.</p><p>But the point of all this, Maria, is that, on the left, for years, they have been saying this is a Republican talking point. OK. It's a Republican conspiracy theory about how this all started.</p><p>That's not the case. I have been involved in federal investigations for 34 years. And there are serious, serious issues about the infection of this with bias. Now, they turn around, they say Strzok and Page, right? They're e-mailing each other. They're texting -- excuse me -- each other.</p><p>And these people have the audacity to say with a straight face, that's their own private, personal opinion? That's ridiculous, because, A, it happened at work. And then, B, they themselves were involved in investigations with these political figures.</p><p>So the bad news for those who've been saying all of that is that there's going to be some accountability. You have heard so many experts say that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, not only that, but you have got real abuse for the FISA court, because there was exculpatory evidence, where apparently, George Papadopoulos, the campaign -- from the campaign, said that: I would never do something like that. That would be treason.</p><p>And they didn't show that to the FISA court.</p><p>BURNS: We have heard this -- we have heard this over and over again, which is that, let's face it, the DNC, right -- I mean, telling you is like telling Babe Ruth about baseball.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNS: But joking aside, the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign, OK, they're working with a law firm, Perkins Coie.</p><p>They hire Fusion GPS. Bruce Ohr's wife works there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>BURNS: Unbelievable conflict of interests right there.</p><p>And then Steele is working with Fusion GPS to develop negative information about President Trump. Now, on the other side of the equation, they go crazy, foaming at the mouth, there was a meeting in Trump Tower to develop negative information. That's horrible. But over here, it's fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURNS: Because, by the way, it's only opposition research.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I wonder if that meeting in Trump Tower was actually a setup also, because...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNS: No, that meeting in Trump Tower -- I'm glad you asked about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>What happened there is, they dangled something like bait for fish.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>BURNS: Saying, we have information. They didn't. It had nothing to do with that, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we have three investigations going on.</p><p>We got John Durham. We got the A.G., Bill Barr, and you have got Lindsey Graham as well in the Senate.</p><p>BURNS: Right. Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham joined me this weekend on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And he said, wait until the inspector general's report comes out on the Russia probe. It's not going to be kind to the Department of Justice. Watch this.</p><p>BURNS: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): And you have got the Horowitz, the inspector general, report that I think will be coming out in weeks, not days, not months. And I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russian probe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ugly and damning.</p><p>BURNS: Well, I heard that. I saw that when he was on.</p><p>And, again, from a trial lawyer, the only question is, can those opposed to this continue to simply maintain, oh, that doesn't mean anything, oh, forget that, swat it away?</p><p>Or will it have an impact? I'm actually thinking that it's going to have some impact. No, no, no, seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know, everybody I have asked in terms of who was the mastermind in all of this tells me look at the CIA.</p><p>BURNS: Yes. Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I'm wondering what was going on with Mr. John Brennan, because, for two years, he was on CNN and MSNBC calling the president treasonous.</p><p>BURNS: Brennan and Clapper are right at the epicenter of this whole thing. There's no question about that, because the intelligence community had a big, big agenda, anti-Trump agenda. There's no question about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we will see. We will see if there's accountability here.</p><p>Doug, it's great to have you.</p><p>BURNS: Hey, thanks. My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it, Doug Burns.</p><p>Big business getting the blame for a growing problem in San Francisco now, but is that fair? What city officials are saying and what residents think is the real problem right here -- next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A new FOX News report details the growing contrast in San Francisco between big business and homelessness. But can one really be blamed for the other? Some city officials say that technology companies like Twitter are causing housing prices to soar, forcing those who can't afford it out on the street, while others say there are bigger issues at hand, like a growing drug problem.</p><p>The host of \"KENNEDY\" on FOX Business right now. Kennedy?</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hello. How are you?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hi, Maria. It's so nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: We're at opposite ends of the day. It's wonderful to meet in the middle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. But I watch you every night anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, thank you.</p><p>So I was kind of fortunate enough to go on a walking tour of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles and saw firsthand the kind of crisis they're dealing with in places like San Francisco and Oakland and Portland and Seattle.</p><p>And it's unreal. And a lot of these mayors really want to just wash their hands and absolve themselves of the crisis. And they take odd comfort in the fact that it's happening in a number of different places. But it doesn't solve the issue.</p><p>And part of it really boils down to too much regulation and too much government in terms of the kind of housing that needs to be built, because there's so much restriction and so much regulation, that it's impossible statewide, but particularly in places like Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and parts of L.A. and L.A. County, to build condominiums and big apartment buildings, instead of these single family dwellings that people can't really afford to buy anymore.</p><p>And if you work a retail job, and you get fired, you're really one paycheck away from this type of homelessness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it goes back to policy. And yet policy-makers are blaming business.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Of course they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you really blame business?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p>And they say this is what happens when you have a free market. You don't have a free market, because the free market would allow for better housing to be built for the type of people who need it.</p><p>And the demand is there, but the supply is not. And that makes real estate prices soar, because the supply is coming restricted. And who benefits from that? Some of the public workers in California who invest in these real estate funds, and they do very well when housing prices are high.</p><p>And that solidifies their retirement portfolios. But that's very unfair to the most vulnerable in these places, who are essentially allowed to live on the streets in all sorts of human waste. And you have got rats. You have got violence. You have got sexual abuse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: When we were in downtown L.A., we saw one patrol car with two police officers in the entire place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So the police are not patrolling as much or...</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p>And there are a lot of...</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have got defecation problems.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And cops getting typhus. And they're asking for transfers out of these hardest-hit areas.</p><p>And in San Francisco, they have something called Snapcrap, where people take pictures of human waste and supposedly sent it -- send it to a group of city workers who have to go -- can you imagine having that job?</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a digital poop map.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: There's an app -- there's a poop app called Snapcrap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. I saw it. Someone sent me the picture the other day, and I was just -- I couldn't believe it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what should be done?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's interesting, because, unfortunately, in a lot of these ultra liberal cities, police are the devil. And so -- and police have really been ostracized and marginalized.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And so they are really held back by a lot of these mayors, and you see it in Portland with the Antifa protests.</p><p>Cops are told to stand down and not do anything. And these are not peaceful protests. And when women are being assaulted in tents in the middle of the night when there isn't a police presence, it's a phenomenal risk that's almost hard to put your head around.</p><p>Does it mean we need more police? No, but it means that these mayors have to come up with some solution, other than throwing a few hundred dollars at people every month, and calling it good, because it's not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And places like San Francisco have become a magnet for homeless people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is immigration or illegal immigrant part of this as well?</p><p>Because I know that these cities, these are liberal cities, are talking about the president as if he's doing the wrong thing.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they are attacking him, instead of looking at their own cities and saying, look, what do we need to do to fix this?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's part of it, but it's not the driver.</p><p>And money is not the answer. Just throwing more and more money and creating more and more layers of bureaucracy doesn't cut it. And then you have these problems that fester for so long that they become a part of the landscape that just doesn't go away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And so what are people doing? They're not visiting places like San Francisco and Seattle the way they used to, because they're being accosted by homeless people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which accelerates the problem.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>So why don't you cut down on some of the regulations and red tape and guidelines and allow people to build more affordable homes? And you know what? Not everyone can afford to live in San Francisco.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It is not a God-given right that every single person has to live in San Francisco or New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And there are other beautiful places to live in this great country of ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're not so beautiful anymore, MONTGOMERY. That's the bottom line.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Starting today, San Francisco is making travelers get their water in new ways.</p><p>That's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>San Francisco International Airport now banning the sale of plastic water bottles at its convenience stores, restaurants and vending machines as well.</p><p>FOX News' Claudia Cowan is there.</p><p>Claudia, good afternoon.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria.</p><p>We're outside of Starbucks here in the domestic terminal at San Francisco International Airport, where the baristas have been busy making coffee today and pulling bottled water off of their shelves.</p><p>In fact, all of the restaurants and stores and kiosks here at SFO have been doing the same thing, getting rid of plastic water bottles they can no longer sell starting today. It's a movie aimed at reducing trash and pollution, though some are shaking their heads at the logic because the ban doesn't apply to every drink that comes in a plastic bottle, just water.</p><p>Airport officials say 10,000 bottles of water are sold every day at SFO and its goal is to send zero waste to landfills by 2021, adding this is a step in that direction.</p><p>But you can still buy soda, tea, juice and other flavored drinks in plastic bottles here. San Francisco has already taken a stand against plastic bags and plastic straws. And officials say they will go after those sugary drinks that come in plastic bottles next.</p><p>Now, if you still have to buy water here at the airport, you have a couple of options. You can buy it in a glass bottle for about $5.35. Or you can buy your sparkling water in a can for about $3. Or, Maria, you can just wait to get it for free once you're on your flight -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Claudia, thank you.</p><p>Meanwhile, airlines are bracing for record travel over the Labor Day period, predicting a 4 percent increase from the same time a year ago.</p><p>If the economy is really doing that bad, why are so many people still spending and traveling?</p><p>TravelPulse.com CEO Mark Murphy joining me now to talk more about that.</p><p>Good to see you, sir.</p><p>MARK MURPHY, FOUNDER, TRAVELPULSE.COM: Yes, same.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting this weekend?</p><p>MURPHY: I'm expecting a boom, just an incredible travel weekend.</p><p>And you just nailed it on the head. Everyone's talking about a recession. But people are out spending. Spending is what's driving the economy. And it's driving the travel industry. The travel industry is absolutely booming.</p><p>And this coming weekend will not be any different.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we have got this weekend. And then the weekend after is the Labor Day holiday. I think that's we're talking about, the Labor Day holiday, right?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. That's what I meant, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, where are people going? Where are you seeing the most spent dollars? Where are they going across the country?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think people are looking to stay closer to home on average. They like to travel three hours or less travel time.</p><p>So wherever you happen to be in the country, that's kind of the metric. That's been a trend going on for a number of years. And so it's basically you're going to go away for a long weekend, you want to be able to spend more time in destination.</p><p>So you have seen a lot of that. The other thing you have seen is the millennials. Millennials are very quick to jump on a plane and, let's say, go to London for the weekend. And that's a new phenomenon, whereas the baby boomers, who kind of pioneered the European travel for Americans, those folks would book two weeks, plan it out a year in advance.</p><p>Millennials are much more seat of the pants, and they're big-time travelers. So you're seeing it really all over the country.</p><p>But what I like to do is -- one of the great tips is go look at Google Flights. Google Flights lets you put in your start city -- for me, it would be Philadelphia as I'm sitting here. And then I leave the destination city open and I hit a link that says explore destinations.</p><p>And for my dates and for nonstop travel, it'll give me city pairs all over the country and as I move the map all around the world, so you can literally just at random say, you know what? I haven't been to Denver. I'm going to go to Denver because it's $247 round trip from Philadelphia, for instance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MURPHY: It's a great little tool. It's a great tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is a good tip. Thank you for that.</p><p>MURPHY: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about prices? What about prices? And how does this period compare to past years? It's typical to always see a lot of people traveling over the -- over the Labor Day weekend. But is it any different, more than years past?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think what you're seeing is a shift.</p><p>Like, the news -- the negative news on the Dominican Republic has negatively impacted them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good point, yes.</p><p>MURPHY: However, those travelers are not, not traveling. Now they have shifted. Many of them have shifted to other Caribbean islands and to Mexico. Mexico is booming.</p><p>A few years ago, Mexico was getting hammered on the media side as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: So it's interesting how things run in cycles. I think fares across the pond, the Atlantic are fantastic right now.</p><p>Destinations like Portugal are booming, because they're great value destinations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MURPHY: And just think the exchange rate. The exchange rate is so fantastic right now for Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true, yes.</p><p>MURPHY: It hasn't been -- the pound hasn't been this low since I think the mid-1980s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: So you should get away if you can. And if you can't get away Labor Day weekend, right after Labor Day weekend, the prices drop even further, because people go back to school and demand drops.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, great point. And the dollar is real strong right now.</p><p>Mark, it's good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MURPHY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.</p><p>That will do it for us for today.</p><p>One quick look at the corner of Wall and Broad. The Dow was down much of the day today, but, really, the sell-off accelerated at the very end of the day, down 173 points on the Dow industrials.</p><p>We will be all over that fallout tomorrow morning on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" on the Fox Business Network right here 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern. I will see you then.</p><p>Have a great rest of the evening, everybody.</p><p>Stay with us. \"THE FIVE\" coming up.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019082001cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-S291-DXH2-62HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>INTERVIEW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Christopher Steele</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>San Francisco</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Hearings &amp;

And a lot of people would like to see. And that very much affects the working -- the workers of our country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO: President Trump also taking aim at the Federal Reserve, saying that they have been tardy when it comes to cutting interest rates. He's calling for a full percent cut, maybe not all at once, but over time.</p><p>Not helping stocks today. Market closing at the lows right now, down 170 points on the Dow industrials.</p><p>Welcome, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo, in today for Neil Cavuto. This is YOUR WORLD.</p><p>John Roberts at the White House right now, where it all is going down.</p><p>John, good afternoon.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good afternoon to you.</p><p>President Trump had a lot to talk about today. We were in the Oval Office for about 30 minutes going over a number of different topics. But first and foremost, of course, was where we are with the economy and where we're headed.</p><p>There's an old saying that if you talk your -- talk about recession enough, you can talk your way into one. So the president didn't want to talk about recession. He wanted to talk about things that he believes that he might be able to do, and specifically things that the Fed could do to stop us from going into one.</p><p>Listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think the word recession is a word that's inappropriate, because it's just a word that the certain people -- I'm going to be kind.</p><p>Certain people and the media are trying to build up, because they'd love to see a recession.</p><p>We're very far from a recession. In fact, if the Fed would do its job, I think we would have a tremendous spurt of growth, a tremendous spurt.</p><p>The Fed is psychologically very important, less so actually, but very psychologically important. And if the Fed would do it's job, which it's really done poorly over the last year-and-a-half, you would see a burst of growth like you have never seen before.</p><p>And that would be lowering interest rates.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: The president very critical of Jerome Powell and what the Fed has been doing, believing that they overshot the mark last year, that they raised interest rates too quickly, too fast -- too quickly, too fast, that would be the same thing -- too high, too quickly.</p><p>And he doesn't like their program of quantitative tightening. So the president is calling -- called again day in the Oval Office for a cut in the Fed Funds Rate of 100 basis points. That would be a full percentage rate cut, which would take it down to the area of about 1 percent.</p><p>The president said, now, not all at once. But then he would also like to see some quantitative easing as well, which we saw during the Obama administration.</p><p>Another thing that the president is thinking about, Maria, is indexing capital gains. It's very popular among a lot of people who tend to be wealthy who have a lot of investments in the market, and also considering another potential cut to the payroll tax.</p><p>This happened in 2011 and 2012 as part of the economic stimulus in the Obama administration. And that is a tax cut that really affects the middle class, because you cap out at about $95,000. And people who make more than that per year don't get the tax cut. So the tax cut goes to people between about $30,000 and $95,000, which is squarely in the middle class.</p><p>Listen to what the president said about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Payroll taxes, I have been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time. Whether or not we do it now or not is -- it's not being done because of recession, because we are -- legitimately, if we had a cut in interest rates by the Fed, if they would do their job properly, and if they would do a meaningful cut, because they raised too fast, you would see growth like you have not seen ever in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You're probably detecting a them there. Even though the president was talking about tax cuts, he came back to the idea of the Fed needing to cut rates and needing to inject some more money into the system as well to keep the economy humming along.</p><p>China, Maria, is also a big piece of this. The president again said today that he is not yet ready to cut a deal with China. And he said whether or not there is short-term pain because of his negotiations with China and his policy of tariffs against China to try to bring them to the table is irrelevant.</p><p>He says we might need some short-term pain because long term if we don't do something about China, it's going to be catastrophic, because they will eat our lunch five to 10 years from now -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they have said that's where they want to go.</p><p>John, thank you so much.</p><p>So is a big rate cut and a middle-class tax cut what's needed to keep this economy moving forward?</p><p>Let's bring in former Dallas Federal Reserve adviser Danielle DiMartino Booth and market watchers Scott Martin and Lee Munson.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>Danielle, let me kick it off with you. Your reaction to a full cut by the Federal Reserve and potentially a cut in payroll taxes?</p><p>DANIELLE DIMARTINO BOOTH, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE ADVISER: Well, it looks like the president is hoping that the country can go out there double- barreled and answer what the European Central Bank, what the Europeans have been promised, which is basically rate cuts and quantitative easing.</p><p>He wants to put some fiscal stimulus on top of that that really targets the middle class, and then capital gains tax cuts as well to hold the stock market together. So it really does seem like a perfect Goldilocks scenario, if he was able to wave a magic wand and make this happen overnight.</p><p>I don't know how willing Jay Powell and his peers are going to be to launch that type of a shock and awe campaign that was really emblematic of some of the -- some of the crisis years, when the economy was truly in much more than a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Scott Martin, how do you see it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, it's funny.</p><p>I mean, talking about '07, and I remember that fall very well. I got married that fall. And other than that event, it was a really bad fall, because, to Danielle's point, the Fed was cutting rates faster than we could even see them being cut.</p><p>And it didn't help. We went into a major financial crisis. And that's what I think worries me here with the Fed on the other side now, as the Trump -- as the president has pointed out, is that they raised too fast. I think they have been too hawkish.</p><p>Even when we got the cut recently at the end of July, Maria, says, well, this is a mid-cycle adjustment, don't get used to this, we're not going to be this nice.</p><p>So it still -- it still to me boggles my mind that you have the 30-year government bond, my friends a skosh over 2 percent. The Fed Funds' overnight target rate at 2.25 percent, that tells you it's too high.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: They need to listen to the markets, not the president, and cut some more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, look at the 10-year, where that is. I mean, it's just extraordinary, what you're -- what we're looking at here, Lee Munson.</p><p>Your reaction. Do you want to see a cut?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: I want to see a cut. And I will tell you why.</p><p>I mean, you ask a lot of bond traders right now, they already think that we're going to see three cuts, maybe 75 basis points, before the end of the year. So the president's not that far off. Number two, I think this is going to be something that's going to help farmers.</p><p>I mean, I'm in New Mexico. You go down to Southern New Mexico, and you see land fallow right now. It's going to help drillers in the energy sector that are overleveraged and can use it. And you have also got to look at local regional banks. They need this right now.</p><p>What people don't understand Maria is that we have with China intertwined trade and national security issues. I do a lot of business with people in national defense. We have got to deal with this Chinese thing. And the president says he will push this economy into recession to deal with that.</p><p>Unlike the Russians, unlike the Soviets, money talks with China, and so I think that we're going to have the guns-and-butter approach. We got to juice this system for the next 12 months so that Trump can get these issues with China worked out.</p><p>Again, I'm fiscally conservative, but we have got to address the intellectual property, thievery, the military espionage, Huawei, all that stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN: All the things they won't agree on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: These are all the things that they reneged on.</p><p>So -- and, by the way, let's not forget that China has broken its promises so many times in so many different situations, whether it's the WTO, or breaking promises with Hong Kong. Look with the two million people in the streets as we speak. Breaking promises with the U.S., saying that they're going to buy beef, and then they don't.</p><p>So even if we were to see a deal, will it be enforceable?</p><p>DIMARTINO BOOTH: Well, I think that, Maria, that's fantastic question, because we have seen them renege and go back on their word time and again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>DIMARTINO BOOTH: We have seen the way that they're treating the people in Hong Kong. They're simply not a trustworthy negotiating partner.</p><p>And I think that there's every reason to question the integrity of China's intentions at this juncture. What I'm not sure about is whether or not tariffs are the correct instrument anymore. And I think that President Trump has seen that and he pulled back on those September the 1st increased tariffs for that very reason.</p><p>And now he's looking for a different way to go about providing relief to this economy, so that it can get through, so that his administration can get through these very tough negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the issue is that the economy feels good.</p><p>But, at the end of the day, we are seeing a bit of a slowdown. We know that Europe is having a hard time generating any growth.</p><p>So what about that, Scott? Do you feel things are poised to slow down considerably by year-end?</p><p>MARTIN: I don't know about considerably. I think the slowdown has already begun.</p><p>I mean, I think -- you mentioned it. It's overseas. It's definitely in the U.S. The housing market, I know homebuilder sentiment is good, but housing prices, from my eye, in certain areas that have been good have slowed down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: Home buyer sentiment has kind of cooled off. We have seen business sentiment waver a bit. Consumer sentiment recently fell off some highs.</p><p>So I think a slowdown is imminent, if not here already, Maria. But, yes, it's not a major slowdown, but one that needs to be helped along a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee Munson, real quick, would you buy into this sell-off or stay on the sidelines here?</p><p>MUNSON: Buy in the sell-off. Buy what's beaten up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MUNSON: We have got 12 more months. And I think the next six months, you buy every dip that you have, and then you start getting concerned. But between now and the end of the year, I think you have to be bold and then - - then I start to get more panicky and freaked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much to the panel. Great conversation there.</p><p>History says, if the economy is good, there is a good chance that the incumbent president gets four more years. So do some new economic jitters have the White House feeling jittery itself?</p><p>We will talk to Karl Rove when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We heard earlier President Trump saying that some of the media are talking down the economy ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>Want to get that read on the -- on that with the former White House deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.</p><p>Karl, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there is something to say about that, that you could talk yourself into a recession, right? How do you see it?</p><p>ROVE: Yes, look, it's interesting how the narrative changes.</p><p>I mean, we have the economy is going really great, and now doubts about where Europe is or doubts about where the world is suddenly become a tempest of conversation in the media about the recession happening before the 2020 election and this affecting the president's reelection chances.</p><p>If a recession were to happen, and it were to happen before the 2020 election, sure kit would have an impact upon the president's reelection. On the other hand, we don't know when the next recession is going to begin.</p><p>And I saw that study the other day of economists in which opinion was split whether there might be recession in 2020 or 2021 or not at all...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROVE: ... in that time frame.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's all speculation.</p><p>ROVE: And so, look, all speculation.</p><p>And I saw. It was interesting. The president today said that he wasn't contemplating at this time a cut in the payroll taxes. And yet, since Monday, this has been a sort of storm of attention, oh, the administration is so worried about it, they're considering a payroll tax cut.</p><p>Well, the first time we heard it addressed by somebody in the administration was the president, and he said, we're always thinking about tax cuts, but we're not thinking about that tax cut right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So what about that?</p><p>I mean, you don't -- so, in other words, you're saying that this is all more speculation, that there's no tax cuts coming, because that would create more worries over the debt, you know that, if we were to...</p><p>ROVE: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Absolutely.</p><p>And it would also -- look, though. With a Democrat House bent upon impeaching the president, let's not kid ourselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROVE: The announcement yesterday by the number four ranking Democrat in the House leadership that he's in favor of impeachment, Jerry Nadler declaring, we don't care whether we have got a resolution of the House empowering us to move forward on our impeachment investigation.</p><p>We have a formal impeachment investigation going on -- going right now. Who thinks that a proposal to cut taxes from the administration would get a fair hearing or any hearing in the House of Representatives whatsoever?</p><p>So better for the president to think about the things that he can do to help strengthen people's confidence in the economy and administrative actions he can take they will add to our prosperity.</p><p>And it would be, in my opinion, a mistake to say, in order to keep us from getting into financial difficulty, in order for us to keep the economy growing, I have got to ask the House of Representatives to do X, because they ain't doing X, whatever it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Well, you make a good point, because this is where it really moves into politics, because the truth is, is the subject of unemployment is not a good subject for the Democratic candidates, because we are at a 51-year low in unemployment.</p><p>ROVE: No. That's right. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Growth is not even a good subject, because we are looking at better than 2 percent growth in the second quarter and 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter.</p><p>ROVE: Well, and then wages, because, remember, under the last two years of the Obama administration...</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then wages. Good point.</p><p>ROVE: Yes, under the last two years of the Obama administration, wages were rising for supervisors more than the working people underneath them.</p><p>I think it was about 75 percent more. In the last two years, I think the number is that wages for working people have been rising at a rate 40 percent higher than those for their supervisors.</p><p>So we have had the turn in the right direction we want, which is the work and people finally get an increase in their salaries and their wages. And people feel that in the pockets.</p><p>That's why I love all this gloom and doom. People say, oh, the economy is slowing up. The economy is turning down. And then we got the July consumer numbers, and what did they say? That the consumers had confidence in -- in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Same with small business. They seem to have confidence in the economy.</p><p>So, yes, you can you can talk yourself into a recession. You can claim -- you can claim, yes, we're there and find yourself there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: But until the American people begin to believe that they have got to somehow sort of shut things down, it ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know...</p><p>ROVE: What was interesting to me was in July that not only were consumers spending, but consumers were saving.</p><p>They were looking at what they were getting in the way of increased wages and saying, I want to spend a little bit more to make my wife -- my wife's family -- my family's life better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: But they also said, we're going to save a little bit more in order to make our family's life better over the long haul.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the savings rate did go up. You're right.</p><p>ROVE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, look, I think it's the level of interest rates that has everybody unnerved, because they're so low. What do you want to see the president focus on then going into 2020?</p><p>He's a business president, first business president. Do you think he should be focused on economic issues?</p><p>ROVE: Well, I think, yes. I think he ought to, because it's the number one issue that people have, the economy.</p><p>If the economy is with you, let's be honest, it doesn't help you as much as it hurts you when the economy is going against you. But it's something where the president's job approval on the handling of the economy has consistently been eight, 10, 11, 12 points ahead of his overall job approval.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: So it's a strength.</p><p>It's also a point of contrast, because, remember, all of these smart people who are running for president as Democrats said, if we have deregulation, if we have a businessman in charge, if we cut taxes, the economy is going to fall into a deep depression.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: And that didn't happen, all those forecasts of how bad it was going to be if we did what Donald Trump said.</p><p>So now Donald Trump is able to say, look what's happened under my -- on my watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>ROVE: And look at all these ideas on the other side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: Look at what they're attempting to do.</p><p>Now, the important part is he has to have one other thing -- three things. Here's what I have done. Here's what the other side wants to do. But he's also got to say, here's the next round of things that I want to do to make the prosperity of America stronger and more durable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's got to look forward. They want to raise taxes, by the way.</p><p>ROVE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Karl. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROVE: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.</p><p>ROVE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders continuing his Iowa blitz, talking to voters at an ice cream social today, this coming as one of his 2020 rivals is starting to melt in the polls. We have got the scope right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Another big day for the Democrats in Iowa, with several 2020 hopefuls making their pitch across the state. Now some new numbers show a bit of a shakeup in the race.</p><p>According to a CNN poll released today, former Vice President Joe Biden has increased his lead. He's polling near 30 percent. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris making the biggest move in this poll, and it is not good. She's dropped to 5 percent. That's down from 17.</p><p>FOX News's Peter Doocy is blitzing Iowa with the candidates -- Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, over my right shoulder, you can see the former Vice President Joe Biden speaking for the first time after a few days on vacation and behind closed doors at fund-raisers.</p><p>He has a little bit more energy than normal. Maybe that's a result of all the rest from the last couple weeks. But something else that is new for an outdoor event for the former vice president, he is reading off of a teleprompter.</p><p>And that does, of course, follow a few days of stories citing anonymous Democratic donors wondering if there is anything that the campaign should be doing differently to avoid some of the gaffes or missteps at the microphone that have caught a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>But, regardless, despite all that, Joe Biden does still have that big lead. And his campaign's first commercial in Iowa that dropped today focuses on his position in the polls as paramount to any position on any kind of policy, which puts his approach at odds with the candidate right behind him in that new CNN poll, Bernie Sanders, who almost never breaks from a script where he preaches the value of Medicare for all to play softball, and to show potential caucus-goers the softer side of Bernie Sanders at the field of dreams.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Obviously, this campaign, very different than the last time, is, instead of two candidates yet, we have 23 or so.</p><p>So no one's going to get 50 percent. I think it's going to be a fight to get 25, 30 percent. But I think we're in that fight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: And I was just inside on this deck where Joe Biden is speaking.</p><p>It's worth pointing out, as we try to figure out which candidates are generating the most excitement in early states like Iowa, it's a smaller venue, and there are a lot of empty seats in the back -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>All right, Peter, thank you.</p><p>You're mentioning Joe Biden rolling out his first Iowa campaign today. Turns out the former V.P. is not rolling in the cash either, at least from smaller online donations. Politico is reporting that Biden' focus on big- money fund-raisers could be backfiring.</p><p>Let's get the read now from American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Larsen, Democratic strategist Robert Patillo.</p><p>Good to see you all. Thanks for being here.</p><p>Robert, what do you make of all this?</p><p>ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think what we're seeing is that Joe Biden right now, if you take Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' poll numbers and combine them, they would tie Joe Biden.</p><p>So I don't believe what Bernie Sanders said about no candidate getting 50 percent. Joe Biden wants the field to start narrowing down from 25 candidates, let's say, to the top five, could very well win this early on in the primary season.</p><p>So let's understand the Biden strategy of not going to the far left, to concentrate on kitchen table issues, on focusing on the economy, on health care, on national security is working.</p><p>And despite what some in the media are trying to push as this leftward socialist leaning of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden's the real center of the party. That's showing in the poll numbers. And it's showing in his lead in the race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe, but he's talking about Medicare for all when he talks about health care.</p><p>Ned, is it working?</p><p>NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY: No.</p><p>I mean, here's the fact, Maria. I think Joe Biden's far more of a paper tiger than people are willing to admit. I mean, cash on hand, he's trailing. You look at the small-dollar donor base, as you mentioned, I mean, back in June, Mayor Pete beat him by a 3-1 advantage on small-dollar donations.</p><p>He was mediocre in the first two debates. He just stumbled his way across Iowa. And the entire premise of Biden is that somehow America is yearning for a return to establishment normalcy.</p><p>And I have to tell you, Maria, America is not yearning for this return to establishment normalcy that wants to sell them out on trade, sell them out on immigration, raise their taxes, snap back to an administrative state run by a ruling class that doesn't prioritize the American people's interests.</p><p>And that's what you get with Joe Biden. I don't see the premise or the appeal. And I have to tell you, as we continue on, I don't see Joe Biden actually winning this nomination, as much as the poll numbers might show right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, he's definitely in the lead.</p><p>But, Emily, are you surprised that he is where he is? And what about Elizabeth Warren? She's really moving up.</p><p>EMILY LARSEN, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Sure.</p><p>Certainly, Elizabeth Warren just had an event where she had 12,000 people come out to see her, which is certainly the biggest of her campaign.</p><p>And I was just in South Carolina this weekend, and she had about almost 1,000 people at her event, while Bernie Sanders had about a third of that the next day in South Carolina. So she is certainly surging.</p><p>But one thing about Joe Biden's fund-raising that's interesting is that he really hasn't followed the pattern of some of these other candidates where they have peaks at the end of fund-raising quarters or at key events like debates or televised town halls.</p><p>And he's sort of had lackluster support, at least among those small grassroots donors, which could be a troubling sign for his campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When do you expect will see a real narrowing of this field?</p><p>LARSEN: Well, the debates will certainly narrow down the field.</p><p>We're going to have probably 10 or 11 candidates in September. There could be a few more in October. But as the debates start to whittle down the field, a lot of the lower-tier candidates will start to fall off, and especially after Iowa.</p><p>I think that's -- a lot of candidates seem to be maybe trying to hang on until Iowa and see how they do. There's a lot of fluctuation in some of the polling right now. And I think they're just waiting to see what happens then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Robert, how do you see it? What do you -- what do you -- how was your reaction to what you're hearing?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, one thing people have to understand is that when you have 25 people in a presidential field, the money's going to be finite.</p><p>Bernie Sanders still has a great online base of young donors who donate small amounts online. Joe Biden's going for the more establishment.</p><p>Once we get the field down after Labor Day, once it goes down to 15, and then 10 and then five, you will see the fund-raising come back for Joe Biden. He is the odds-on favorite, the 2-1 favorite to win right now. So I don't think anything's going to shake that up right as of this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think President Obama hasn't endorsed Biden?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, he doesn't want put his finger on the scales right now. We're still early in the season.</p><p>We're almost a year, year-and-a-half out from the primary. So as the field narrows down, once we get closer to the convention, then we will see President Obama step in. But he's not going to put his finger on the scale right now this early in the race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, everybody, great conversation. We so appreciate your time. Thank you. We will see you soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, more big trouble for big tech. Industry titans could be facing a new antitrust probe.</p><p>More on that right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: San Francisco to flyers: Put that plastic down.</p><p>Find out how the airport in the City by the Bay is making travelers get their water in new ways. We report, you might hide.</p><p>We're back in 60 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Big tech is back in the spotlight, as the Justice Department says it is working with a group of state attorneys general on an antitrust investigation into the industry, this coming after the DOJ launched its own review of tech giants like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Is all of this scrutiny justified?</p><p>Cybersecurity expert and attorney Leeza Garber is here now with me to talk more about that.</p><p>So, what do you think?</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You too.</p><p>GARBER: This is a hugely expanding issue. And we have different parts of the United States federal and state government looking into what Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google are doing.</p><p>And this comes on the heels of the E.U. already investigating these kind of antitrust actions. And it's so important that we -- important that we do this to protect consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I mean, well, look, the competition is slim when you look at competitors to a Google. Google has, what, 90 percent of market share in search.</p><p>GARBER: There are no competitors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GARBER: Yes, that's the funny thing. I mean, you look at it, there's really no feasible alternative to Facebook. Basically, if you're on a social media platform, you're on Facebook, since they acquired Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>How do you control something like that? It's a behemoth. But at the same time, the way our antitrust law is written, there's really no fiscal part to that for consumers, because it's -- quote, unquote -- \"technically free,\" even though they're trafficking in our data.</p><p>So it's very difficult to apply these laws to these kind of conceptual tech giants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I remember back in the day when Microsoft was the target of antitrust regulators because it was so big and also a similar situation in terms of its competitive reach.</p><p>It was heavy fines, it was a lot of backlash. The investors reacted. Is that what you're expecting here? Do you think investors start reacting? How significant will this be for these companies?</p><p>GARBER: It's going to be significant.</p><p>But, in general, the scale of what's significant is changing, right? Because you look at the FTC fine for Facebook's privacy violations, which was $5 billion, some people called it astounding and influential. Some people called it a drop in the bucket, because, compared to their -- their proceeds and everything else, it's a very minimal percentage, and it's really a slap on the wrist.</p><p>So how we go about kind of handling these antitrust issues, there are lots of different ways it could occur, but it definitely will have some sort of fiscal effect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder if it's, in addition to antitrust, you also have the conversation of conservatives getting censored and whether or not that's part of the -- of the upset on the part of regulators in Washington.</p><p>Certainly, the president has spoken about this.</p><p>GARBER: Definitely.</p><p>And you touch on a really important point, which is for so many of these giants, we can't see the inner goings-on of Google and how they rank these results. We can't see what Facebook is really doing with our data. And that's part of the problem as well.</p><p>Antitrust actions might help with maybe dismantling some of these things. What does that look like? Maybe it's unbundling acquisitions like Facebook from WhatsApp or Instagram.</p><p>But, for Amazon, for instance, it's selling platform. They're also selling their own goods. So there are all these different ways to look at it. But Google definitely will have to deal with the bias problem as a separate issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will tell you, Europe has been so much more significant in terms of its oversight and heavy-handedness, as opposed to the U.S.</p><p>GARBER: Definitely.</p><p>It's because, last year, they enacted the General Data Protective Regulation, the GDPR. They really look at privacy as a human right, like Apple always likes to say, although they have come into some problems with that issue recently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GARBER: But the E.U. has definitely led the way in terms of protecting user privacy and protecting consumers online.</p><p>And that's what the U.S. really needs to catch up to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we will see if the U.S. ends up getting close to where Europe is. That would be significant for these companies. That would be a big deal, a negative.</p><p>GARBER: It would be a huge deal.</p><p>But it's going to take a really long time. And what that's going to look like, it's still really up in the air.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Leeza, it's great to see you.</p><p>GARBER: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>GARBER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love having you.</p><p>All right. Meanwhile, the FBI says that they released all the communication they had between the bureau and ex-British spy Christopher Steele. A federal judge just told them to keep on digging.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A federal judge has ordered the FBI to look for more communication between the FBI and the ex-British spy Christopher Steele.</p><p>Steele's dossier, of course, was used by the FBI to justify the surveillance of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.</p><p>Former DOJ prosecutor with me now, Doug Burns.</p><p>Doug, it's great to see you.</p><p>DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>BURNS: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you think? Are they going to come up with these documents? Or are they going to keep sitting on these documents?</p><p>BURNS: Well, it's a victory for Judicial Watch, obviously, and it's a victory for those who want to get to the bottom of what happened.</p><p>But to your question, which I'm not dodging, it's still an open question how many documents they are actually going to get.</p><p>But the point of all this, Maria, is that, on the left, for years, they have been saying this is a Republican talking point. OK. It's a Republican conspiracy theory about how this all started.</p><p>That's not the case. I have been involved in federal investigations for 34 years. And there are serious, serious issues about the infection of this with bias. Now, they turn around, they say Strzok and Page, right? They're e-mailing each other. They're texting -- excuse me -- each other.</p><p>And these people have the audacity to say with a straight face, that's their own private, personal opinion? That's ridiculous, because, A, it happened at work. And then, B, they themselves were involved in investigations with these political figures.</p><p>So the bad news for those who've been saying all of that is that there's going to be some accountability. You have heard so many experts say that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, not only that, but you have got real abuse for the FISA court, because there was exculpatory evidence, where apparently, George Papadopoulos, the campaign -- from the campaign, said that: I would never do something like that. That would be treason.</p><p>And they didn't show that to the FISA court.</p><p>BURNS: We have heard this -- we have heard this over and over again, which is that, let's face it, the DNC, right -- I mean, telling you is like telling Babe Ruth about baseball.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNS: But joking aside, the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign, OK, they're working with a law firm, Perkins Coie.</p><p>They hire Fusion GPS. Bruce Ohr's wife works there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>BURNS: Unbelievable conflict of interests right there.</p><p>And then Steele is working with Fusion GPS to develop negative information about President Trump. Now, on the other side of the equation, they go crazy, foaming at the mouth, there was a meeting in Trump Tower to develop negative information. That's horrible. But over here, it's fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURNS: Because, by the way, it's only opposition research.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I wonder if that meeting in Trump Tower was actually a setup also, because...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNS: No, that meeting in Trump Tower -- I'm glad you asked about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>What happened there is, they dangled something like bait for fish.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>BURNS: Saying, we have information. They didn't. It had nothing to do with that, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we have three investigations going on.</p><p>We got John Durham. We got the A.G., Bill Barr, and you have got Lindsey Graham as well in the Senate.</p><p>BURNS: Right. Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham joined me this weekend on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And he said, wait until the inspector general's report comes out on the Russia probe. It's not going to be kind to the Department of Justice. Watch this.</p><p>BURNS: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): And you have got the Horowitz, the inspector general, report that I think will be coming out in weeks, not days, not months. And I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russian probe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ugly and damning.</p><p>BURNS: Well, I heard that. I saw that when he was on.</p><p>And, again, from a trial lawyer, the only question is, can those opposed to this continue to simply maintain, oh, that doesn't mean anything, oh, forget that, swat it away?</p><p>Or will it have an impact? I'm actually thinking that it's going to have some impact. No, no, no, seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know, everybody I have asked in terms of who was the mastermind in all of this tells me look at the CIA.</p><p>BURNS: Yes. Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I'm wondering what was going on with Mr. John Brennan, because, for two years, he was on CNN and MSNBC calling the president treasonous.</p><p>BURNS: Brennan and Clapper are right at the epicenter of this whole thing. There's no question about that, because the intelligence community had a big, big agenda, anti-Trump agenda. There's no question about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we will see. We will see if there's accountability here.</p><p>Doug, it's great to have you.</p><p>BURNS: Hey, thanks. My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it, Doug Burns.</p><p>Big business getting the blame for a growing problem in San Francisco now, but is that fair? What city officials are saying and what residents think is the real problem right here -- next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A new FOX News report details the growing contrast in San Francisco between big business and homelessness. But can one really be blamed for the other? Some city officials say that technology companies like Twitter are causing housing prices to soar, forcing those who can't afford it out on the street, while others say there are bigger issues at hand, like a growing drug problem.</p><p>The host of \"KENNEDY\" on FOX Business right now. Kennedy?</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hello.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hello. How are you?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hi, Maria. It's so nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: We're at opposite ends of the day. It's wonderful to meet in the middle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. But I watch you every night anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, thank you.</p><p>So I was kind of fortunate enough to go on a walking tour of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles and saw firsthand the kind of crisis they're dealing with in places like San Francisco and Oakland and Portland and Seattle.</p><p>And it's unreal. And a lot of these mayors really want to just wash their hands and absolve themselves of the crisis. And they take odd comfort in the fact that it's happening in a number of different places. But it doesn't solve the issue.</p><p>And part of it really boils down to too much regulation and too much government in terms of the kind of housing that needs to be built, because there's so much restriction and so much regulation, that it's impossible statewide, but particularly in places like Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and parts of L.A. and L.A. County, to build condominiums and big apartment buildings, instead of these single family dwellings that people can't really afford to buy anymore.</p><p>And if you work a retail job, and you get fired, you're really one paycheck away from this type of homelessness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it goes back to policy. And yet policy-makers are blaming business.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Of course they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you really blame business?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p>And they say this is what happens when you have a free market. You don't have a free market, because the free market would allow for better housing to be built for the type of people who need it.</p><p>And the demand is there, but the supply is not. And that makes real estate prices soar, because the supply is coming restricted. And who benefits from that? Some of the public workers in California who invest in these real estate funds, and they do very well when housing prices are high.</p><p>And that solidifies their retirement portfolios. But that's very unfair to the most vulnerable in these places, who are essentially allowed to live on the streets in all sorts of human waste. And you have got rats. You have got violence. You have got sexual abuse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: When we were in downtown L.A., we saw one patrol car with two police officers in the entire place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So the police are not patrolling as much or...</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p>And there are a lot of...</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have got defecation problems.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And cops getting typhus. And they're asking for transfers out of these hardest-hit areas.</p><p>And in San Francisco, they have something called Snapcrap, where people take pictures of human waste and supposedly sent it -- send it to a group of city workers who have to go -- can you imagine having that job?</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a digital poop map.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: There's an app -- there's a poop app called Snapcrap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know. I saw it. Someone sent me the picture the other day, and I was just -- I couldn't believe it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what should be done?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's interesting, because, unfortunately, in a lot of these ultra liberal cities, police are the devil. And so -- and police have really been ostracized and marginalized.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And so they are really held back by a lot of these mayors, and you see it in Portland with the Antifa protests.</p><p>Cops are told to stand down and not do anything. And these are not peaceful protests. And when women are being assaulted in tents in the middle of the night when there isn't a police presence, it's a phenomenal risk that's almost hard to put your head around.</p><p>Does it mean we need more police? No, but it means that these mayors have to come up with some solution, other than throwing a few hundred dollars at people every month, and calling it good, because it's not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And places like San Francisco have become a magnet for homeless people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is immigration or illegal immigrant part of this as well?</p><p>Because I know that these cities, these are liberal cities, are talking about the president as if he's doing the wrong thing.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they are attacking him, instead of looking at their own cities and saying, look, what do we need to do to fix this?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It's part of it, but it's not the driver.</p><p>And money is not the answer. Just throwing more and more money and creating more and more layers of bureaucracy doesn't cut it. And then you have these problems that fester for so long that they become a part of the landscape that just doesn't go away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And so what are people doing? They're not visiting places like San Francisco and Seattle the way they used to, because they're being accosted by homeless people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which accelerates the problem.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>So why don't you cut down on some of the regulations and red tape and guidelines and allow people to build more affordable homes? And you know what? Not everyone can afford to live in San Francisco.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: It is not a God-given right that every single person has to live in San Francisco or New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And there are other beautiful places to live in this great country of ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're not so beautiful anymore, MONTGOMERY. That's the bottom line.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Starting today, San Francisco is making travelers get their water in new ways.</p><p>That's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>San Francisco International Airport now banning the sale of plastic water bottles at its convenience stores, restaurants and vending machines as well.</p><p>FOX News' Claudia Cowan is there.</p><p>Claudia, good afternoon.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria.</p><p>We're outside of Starbucks here in the domestic terminal at San Francisco International Airport, where the baristas have been busy making coffee today and pulling bottled water off of their shelves.</p><p>In fact, all of the restaurants and stores and kiosks here at SFO have been doing the same thing, getting rid of plastic water bottles they can no longer sell starting today. It's a movie aimed at reducing trash and pollution, though some are shaking their heads at the logic because the ban doesn't apply to every drink that comes in a plastic bottle, just water.</p><p>Airport officials say 10,000 bottles of water are sold every day at SFO and its goal is to send zero waste to landfills by 2021, adding this is a step in that direction.</p><p>But you can still buy soda, tea, juice and other flavored drinks in plastic bottles here. San Francisco has already taken a stand against plastic bags and plastic straws. And officials say they will go after those sugary drinks that come in plastic bottles next.</p><p>Now, if you still have to buy water here at the airport, you have a couple of options. You can buy it in a glass bottle for about $5.35. Or you can buy your sparkling water in a can for about $3. Or, Maria, you can just wait to get it for free once you're on your flight -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Claudia, thank you.</p><p>Meanwhile, airlines are bracing for record travel over the Labor Day period, predicting a 4 percent increase from the same time a year ago.</p><p>If the economy is really doing that bad, why are so many people still spending and traveling?</p><p>TravelPulse.com CEO Mark Murphy joining me now to talk more about that.</p><p>Good to see you, sir.</p><p>MARK MURPHY, FOUNDER, TRAVELPULSE.COM: Yes, same.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting this weekend?</p><p>MURPHY: I'm expecting a boom, just an incredible travel weekend.</p><p>And you just nailed it on the head. Everyone's talking about a recession. But people are out spending. Spending is what's driving the economy. And it's driving the travel industry. The travel industry is absolutely booming.</p><p>And this coming weekend will not be any different.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we have got this weekend. And then the weekend after is the Labor Day holiday. I think that's we're talking about, the Labor Day holiday, right?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. That's what I meant, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, where are people going? Where are you seeing the most spent dollars? Where are they going across the country?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think people are looking to stay closer to home on average. They like to travel three hours or less travel time.</p><p>So wherever you happen to be in the country, that's kind of the metric. That's been a trend going on for a number of years. And so it's basically you're going to go away for a long weekend, you want to be able to spend more time in destination.</p><p>So you have seen a lot of that. The other thing you have seen is the millennials. Millennials are very quick to jump on a plane and, let's say, go to London for the weekend. And that's a new phenomenon, whereas the baby boomers, who kind of pioneered the European travel for Americans, those folks would book two weeks, plan it out a year in advance.</p><p>Millennials are much more seat of the pants, and they're big-time travelers. So you're seeing it really all over the country.</p><p>But what I like to do is -- one of the great tips is go look at Google Flights. Google Flights lets you put in your start city -- for me, it would be Philadelphia as I'm sitting here. And then I leave the destination city open and I hit a link that says explore destinations.</p><p>And for my dates and for nonstop travel, it'll give me city pairs all over the country and as I move the map all around the world, so you can literally just at random say, you know what? I haven't been to Denver. I'm going to go to Denver because it's $247 round trip from Philadelphia, for instance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MURPHY: It's a great little tool. It's a great tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is a good tip. Thank you for that.</p><p>MURPHY: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about prices? What about prices? And how does this period compare to past years? It's typical to always see a lot of people traveling over the -- over the Labor Day weekend. But is it any different, more than years past?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think what you're seeing is a shift.</p><p>Like, the news -- the negative news on the Dominican Republic has negatively impacted them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good point, yes.</p><p>MURPHY: However, those travelers are not, not traveling. Now they have shifted. Many of them have shifted to other Caribbean islands and to Mexico. Mexico is booming.</p><p>A few years ago, Mexico was getting hammered on the media side as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: So it's interesting how things run in cycles. I think fares across the pond, the Atlantic are fantastic right now.</p><p>Destinations like Portugal are booming, because they're great value destinations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MURPHY: And just think the exchange rate. The exchange rate is so fantastic right now for Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true, yes.</p><p>MURPHY: It hasn't been -- the pound hasn't been this low since I think the mid-1980s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: So you should get away if you can. And if you can't get away Labor Day weekend, right after Labor Day weekend, the prices drop even further, because people go back to school and demand drops.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, great point. And the dollar is real strong right now.</p><p>Mark, it's good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MURPHY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.</p><p>That will do it for us for today.</p><p>One quick look at the corner of Wall and Broad. The Dow was down much of the day today, but, really, the sell-off accelerated at the very end of the day, down 173 points on the Dow industrials.</p><p>We will be all over that fallout tomorrow morning on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" on the Fox Business Network right here 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The race to produce cutting-edge tech products that set you apart from the crowd is never-ending in a sector that is constantly upgrading. And in order to dominate the market, you have to be the best. But in addition to the market pressure tech companies face when it comes to the actual products, each brand is also vying to employ the best talent. </p><p>One of the most common perks provided by tech giants is onsite cafeterias where quality food is provided to employees at no extra cost. In the hunt for talented employees, both big tech companies and smaller startups have offered perks to sweeten the deal for potential employees. Google famously provided nap pods for its employees while other tech giants have offered onsite massages and doctors in order to look more appealing for job seekers. One of the most common perks provided by tech giants is onsite cafeterias where quality food is provided to employees at no extra cost. In addition to increasing productivity by incentivizing employees to stay onsite and take shorter lunches, offering free food also provides relief to employees. And since Silicon Valley is not known for its low cost of living, free food is a real draw for potential employees. If they were going to have to pay astronomical costs to live in the city\u2014 sometimes as high as $3,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment\u2014then at least they could save a few bucks by eating lunch for free. This in-kind payment may be cheaper to provide than you'd think since the company might be able to get better deals on the food than individuals, since they're buying in bulk. Feeding one's workers also fosters a familial atmosphere that may increase worker loyalty. The new measure is more about protectionism and government control than anything else. But the era of employee cafeterias may soon be coming to an end thanks to two San Francisco city officials. City supervisors Ahsha Safa and Aaron Peskin recently proposed new regulations that would make onsite cafeterias illegal. If passed, the measure will ban the construction of employee cafeterias in new buildings, but existing cafeterias will be allowed to stay. Banning cafeterias in private buildings seems like an absurd quest to take on. But the new measure is more about protectionism and government control than anything else.When 'Buy Local' becomes a WeaponIn 2011, tech companies were given a payroll tax break in exchange for moving into Mid-Market, a rough area in San Francisco near City Hall. The city had hoped that if these tech companies to move into the neighborhood, they would bring jobs and commerce with them. But this plan has not unfolded quite like city officials had planned. While the tech companies themselves are doing just fine, other local businesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Many restaurants, in particular, had to close due to an inability to draw in customers. Of course, the restaurateurs were naturally frustrated but they chose to blame their low sales on the tech companies. Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, supported the cafeteria ban. They reasoned that since some of these companies provide cafeterias, employees were choosing to stay on site to purchase food or snacks, rather than going to a nearby restaurant or cafe. Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, supported the cafeteria ban saying, 'you can't compete with free.' And while it is surely more convenient to blame other people than it is to reevaluate your business plan, there are many other factors to consider when looking at this struggling neighborhood. San Francisco is infamous for being disgusting. In addition to seeing people defecate in the street, it is not uncommon to see used needles and hard drug use taking place right outside of the buildings that are currently home to Square, Twitter, and Uber. In fact, each of these buildings is heavily secured in order to keep the craziness of the streets at bay. Recently, one store owner in this neighborhood had to kick someone out of his store for taking his pants off. That same person later came back to urinate on the store's window. However, this same business owner has also been shocked that his store isn't thriving when clearly, there are other issues far more problematic than free cafeterias. The presence of these tech companies cannot magically clean up the streets of San Francisco. The presence of these tech companies cannot magically clean up the streets of San Francisco. But city officials are acting as though Square, Twitter, and Uber have somehow failing to live up to the terms of the tax break by failing to transform the city. But the only thing required of these companies in order to receive the tax break was to move into Mid-Market, which they have. Peskin, one of the architects of the new ban, tried to blame the tech industry and their lack of community for the continued degradation of the neighborhood saying:'We don't want employees biking or driving into their office, staying there all day long and going home. This is about getting people out of their office, interacting with the community and adding to the vibrancy of the community.'But unfortunately for Peskin, city officials do not have the authority to dictate its residents behavior, especially when it comes to commerce. James Manning, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories commented on the new measure to ban employee cafeterias:'I'm not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat. The idea the food doesn't need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.'To be sure, when Manning speaks of subsidies, he speaks of them in a private fashion. To call these lunches 'free' would be misleading, as they are subsidized by the companies and are a type of employee benefit. Choosing to offer free food to your employee is something you are doing at your own cost as a means of compensation for your employees. If, like many already do, a tech company chooses to offer onsite doctors to its employees, the government wouldn't tell them to stop this practice because the neighborhood doctors were missing out on patients. And yet, this type of regulatory chaos is exactly what is happening with the cafeterias. But as with most regulations, when you dig deeper you uncover the underlying motivation: protectionism from others refusing to compete.Protectionism from All AnglesCompetition is tough. No one has ever said anything to the contrary. And when you have sacrificed your life savings to get a business off the ground only to see it fail, it is absolutely understandable for someone to be angry. But blaming others does little to remedy the problem. The same can be said for trying to legislate individual behavior in order to rig the competition; it is never justified and always wrong. But this is exactly what some of the neighboring businesses are doing. Setting up shop in the Mid-Market neighborhood was a risk from the get go. After all, the homelessness and prevalent drug abuse had been there long before the new tech companies moved into town. Each entrepreneur knew this before opening their doors, but they relied on companies like Square and Twitter to hand them customers on a platter, rather than work for them. The food being offered at these 'off campus' restaurants was not enough to compete with the free lunch offered on site. Unfortunately, the food being offered at these 'off campus' restaurants was not enough to compete with the free lunch offered on site and it was certainly not enough to coax these employees out onto the dangerous streets. But this does not justify the creation of new laws. To make matters worse for the tech companies, they are dealing with protectionism from all angles. Not only are restaurant owners angry, but other tech companies are seeing this proposed regulation as a chance to compete for talent. 'This could even the playing field a bit,' Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame said. Credit Sesame is a startup that provides free credit scores and does not provide a cafeteria to its employees. Rava believes that by implementing this ban, his company along with others like Salesforce, which also does not have a cafeteria, will stand a better chance at attracting potential employees. Just like the restaurant owners, neighboring tech companies are also trying to use the government to shield themselves from competition.Protectionists Gonna ProtectThe new restrictions are not set to be voted on until the fall at the earliest. One can only hope that common sense prevails in the meantime. Market competition is about a lot more than just the product you offer. Companies with great products, or great food, have often failed because their marketing strategy didn't work, and this can also include choosing to open a business in a rough neighborhood. Location matters, especially for a restaurant, and if the neighborhood does not provide you with the sales you are looking for, you can choose to either take the risk and be ready to deal with the consequences, or move somewhere else.

The race to produce cutting-edge tech products that set you apart from the crowd is never-ending in a sector that is constantly upgrading. And in order to dominate the market, you have to be the best. But in addition to the market pressure tech companies face when it comes to the actual products, each brand is also vying to employ the best talent.</p><p><br/>One of the most common perks provided by tech giants is onsite cafeterias where quality food is provided to employees at no extra cost.<br/>In the hunt for talented employees, both big tech companies and smaller startups have offered perks to sweeten the deal for potential employees. Google famously provided nap pods for its employees while other tech giants have offered onsite massages and doctors in order to look more appealing for job seekers. One of the most common perks provided by tech giants is onsite cafeterias where quality food is provided to employees at no extra cost. <br/>In addition to increasing productivity by incentivizing employees to stay onsite and take shorter lunches, offering free food also provides relief to employees. And since Silicon Valley is not known for its low cost of living, free food is a real draw for potential employees. If they were going to have to pay astronomical costs to live in the city- sometimes as high as $3,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment-then at least they could save a few bucks by eating lunch for free. This in-kind payment may be cheaper to provide than you'd think since the company might be able to get better deals on the food than individuals, since they're buying in bulk.<br/>Feeding one's workers also fosters a familial atmosphere that may increase worker loyalty.<br/>The new measure is more about protectionism and government control than anything else.<br/>But the era of employee cafeterias may soon be coming to an end thanks to two San Francisco city officials. City supervisors Ahsha Safa\u00ed and Aaron Peskin recently proposed new regulations that would make onsite cafeterias illegal. If passed, the measure will ban the construction of employee cafeterias in new buildings, but existing cafeterias will be allowed to stay. Banning cafeterias in private buildings seems like an absurd quest to take on. But the new measure is more about protectionism and government control than anything else. <br/>When \"Buy Local\" becomes a Weapon<br/>In 2011, tech companies were given a payroll tax break in exchange for moving into Mid-Market, a rough area in San Francisco near City Hall. The city had hoped that if these tech companies to move into the neighborhood, they would bring jobs and commerce with them. But this plan has not unfolded quite like city officials had planned.\u00a0<br/>While the tech companies themselves are doing just fine, other local businesses are struggling to keep their doors open. Many restaurants, in particular, had to close due to an inability to draw in customers. Of course, the restaurateurs were naturally frustrated but they chose to blame their low sales on the tech companies.<br/>Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, supported the cafeteria ban.<br/>They reasoned that since some of these companies provide cafeterias, employees were choosing to stay on site to purchase food or snacks, rather than going to a nearby restaurant or cafe. Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, supported the cafeteria ban saying, \"you can't compete with free.\"<br/>And while it is surely more convenient to blame other people than it is to reevaluate your business plan, there are many other factors to consider when looking at this struggling neighborhood.<br/>San Francisco is infamous for being disgusting. In addition to seeing people defecate in the street, it is not uncommon to see used needles and hard drug use taking place right outside of the buildings that are currently home to Square, Twitter, and Uber. In fact, each of these buildings is heavily secured in order to keep the craziness of the streets at bay. Recently, one store owner in this neighborhood had to kick someone out of his store for taking his pants off. That same person later came back to urinate on the store's window. However, this same business owner has also been shocked that his store isn't thriving when clearly, there are other issues far more problematic than free cafeterias.<br/>The presence of these tech companies cannot magically clean up the streets of San Francisco.<br/>The presence of these tech companies cannot magically clean up the streets of San Francisco. But city officials are acting as though Square, Twitter, and Uber have somehow failing to live up to the terms of the tax break by failing to transform the city. But the only thing required of these companies in order to receive the tax break was to move into Mid-Market, which they have. <br/>Peskin, one of the architects of the new ban, tried to blame the tech industry and their lack of community for the continued degradation of the neighborhood saying:<br/>\"We don't want employees biking or driving into their office, staying there all day long and going home. This is about getting people out of their office, interacting with the community and adding to the vibrancy of the community.\"<br/>But unfortunately for Peskin, city officials do not have the authority to dictate its residents behavior, especially when it comes to commerce. <br/>James Manning, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories commented on the new measure to ban employee cafeterias:<br/>\"I'm not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat. The idea the food doesn't need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.\"<br/>To be sure, when Manning speaks of subsidies, he speaks of them in a private fashion. To call these lunches \"free\" would be misleading, as they are subsidized by the companies and are a type of employee benefit. Choosing to offer free food to your employee is something you are doing at your own cost as a means of compensation for your employees. If, like many already do, a tech company chooses to offer onsite doctors to its employees, the government wouldn't tell them to stop this practice because the neighborhood doctors were missing out on patients. And yet, this type of regulatory chaos is exactly what is happening with the cafeterias.<br/>But as with most regulations, when you dig deeper you uncover the underlying motivation: protectionism from others refusing to compete. <br/>Protectionism from All Angles<br/>Competition is tough. No one has ever said anything to the contrary. And when you have sacrificed your life savings to get a business off the ground only to see it fail, it is absolutely understandable for someone to be angry. But blaming others does little to remedy the problem. The same can be said for trying to legislate individual behavior in order to rig the competition; it is never justified and always wrong. But this is exactly what some of the neighboring businesses are doing. <br/>Setting up shop in the Mid-Market neighborhood was a risk from the get go. After all, the homelessness and prevalent drug abuse had been there long before the new tech companies moved into town. Each entrepreneur knew this before opening their doors, but they relied on companies like Square and Twitter to hand them customers on a platter, rather than work for them.<br/>The food being offered at these \"off campus\" restaurants was not enough to compete with the free lunch offered on site.<br/>Unfortunately, the food being offered at these \"off campus\" restaurants was not enough to compete with the free lunch offered on site and it was certainly not enough to coax these employees out onto the dangerous streets. But this does not justify the creation of new laws. <br/>To make matters worse for the tech companies, they are dealing with protectionism from all angles. Not only are restaurant owners angry, but other tech companies are seeing this proposed regulation as a chance to compete for talent. <br/>\"This could even the playing field a bit,\" Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame said. Credit Sesame is a startup that provides free credit scores and does not provide a cafeteria to its employees. Rava believes that by implementing this ban, his company along with others like Salesforce, which also does not have a cafeteria, will stand a better chance at attracting potential employees. Just like the restaurant owners, neighboring tech companies are also trying to use the government to shield themselves from competition. <br/>Protectionists Gonna Protect<br/>The new restrictions are not set to be voted on until the fall at the earliest. One can only hope that common sense prevails in the meantime. Market competition is about a lot more than just the product you offer. Companies with great products, or great food, have often failed because their marketing strategy didn't work, and this can also include choosing to open a business in a rough neighborhood. Location matters, especially for a restaurant, and if the neighborhood does not provide you with the sales you are looking for, you can choose to either take the risk and be ready to deal with the consequences, or move somewhere else. But resorting to protectionism in order to control the opposition is wrong.

If officials there want people to stay home and avoid interacting with others at the checkout lines, they should do everything they can to encourage these kinds of services. Instead, Mayor London Breed on Friday issued an emergency edict[2] that will discourage home deliveries and will likely boost prices - and reduce choices - for consumers. The order, announced with support from the Board of Supervisors[3], caps all commission fees that home-delivery apps charge to restaurants at 15 percent. </p><p>The caps stay in place until restaurants are allowed to offer dine-in service again. These companies sometimes charge as much as 30 percent, but often charge as little as 10 percent. Everyone is sympathetic to the plight of restaurants during these trying times. In San Francisco, restaurant owners have complained about low profit margins after they pay the firms that delivery the meals to people's homes. But whenever government caps the price of a product or service, the end result always is the same: shortages[4]. 'If the city attempts to dictate contract terms between delivery services and restaurants, it would force our services to radically alter our businesses just as we desperately try to meet the needs of restaurants, delivery people, customers and our communities,' according to an April 8 letter[5] to San Francisco officials from four companies that provide deliveries (DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats). The commission caps, the letter explains[6], would increase fees for consumers, thus putting home deliveries 'out of reach for all but the city's most prosperous residents.' Furthermore, they not only provide needed food for the city's residents, but have been a lifeline for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Delivery apps also provide an ongoing source of income for drivers and restaurants - no small thing during these tough economic times. Despite the tired criticisms[7] of those who complain that these companies are flourishing during the crisis, the reality is much different. According to the letter, DoorDash has slashed fees[8] charged to independent restaurants by 50 percent. Grubhub has provided $30 million in aid to restaurants. Uber Eats waived customer fees for orders from small restaurants. Postmates has waived commissions for new brick-and-mortar retail merchants in San Francisco. These are just a few of the ways that these app-based companies - like many companies[9] in myriad industries - have creatively confronted the COVID-19 challenge. It's best to let voluntary relationships sort themselves out, rather than allow government to impose heavy-handed and counterproductive regulations. All companies need the flexibility to determine their own price structures and run their businesses as they know best. App-based delivery companies rightly are concerned that San Francisco's emergency order will be mimicked elsewhere. Officials in Chicago and New York, for instance, already have discussed similar measures[10]. Some people worry that it might be hard to get rid of the cumbersome new rules even after the crisis passes. San Francisco's edict was supported by the local restaurant lobby[11] which, presumably, would see the foolishness of price controls if the city capped restaurant profits to protect struggling homebound residents. Ironically, many restaurants could suffer the most from the caps, given that they could depress demand for deliveries and, as Restaurant Dive noted[12], 'force delivery companies to stop doing business with lower-cost restaurants.' One of the reasons Americans have survived the economic clampdown as well as they have is because of our market-based system[13] that allows prices to free to rise and fall based on supply and demand. This is how markets work every day, even if we don't like when some things cost more than we'd prefer to pay. Whenever governments mess with that process, customers can't get what they need - or have to wait in line or do without. Instead of waiting to see the easily predictable consequences[14] of the edict, the city should roll back the regulations and let restaurants and app-based delivery companies work out their own arrangements. San Franciscans need food-delivery services now more than ever, so it would be tragic if the city made it harder for residents to access them.
