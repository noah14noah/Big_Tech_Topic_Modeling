It allows users to request a one-time password, sent by text message, each time they log onto the social-networking site. But some advertisers managed to target Facebook users who uploaded those contact details, perhaps without the full knowledge of those who provided them, the two sources said. The misuse of the phone numbers was first identified in media reports and by academics this year.</p><p>The FTC also plans to allege that Facebook had provided insufficient information to users - roughly 30 million - about their ability to turn off a tool that would identify and offer tag suggestions for photos, the sources added. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. The facial recognition issue appears to have first been publicized earlier this year by Consumer Reports.</p><p>The FTC declined to comment. Facebook also declined to comment.</p><p>As part of the complaint, the US regulator is expected to unveil a settlement with Facebook \u2013 a reported $5 billion fine that might be the least painful part of the agreement for the social network. The deal, which follows a lengthy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allows Facebook to avoid prosecution for its data protection lapses.</p><p>The real question, however, remains what type of restrictions and requirements will be placed on the internet giant to ensure future compliance. CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg holds a firm grasp on the reins of Facebook, which has some 2.7 billion users, and he will be held personally responsible for implementation of the settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The young billionaire will be required to check in quarterly with the FTC to certify that his company is abiding by stipulations. A false statement, the WSJ reported, would be subject to penalties, an anonymous source with knowledge of the situation told the newspaper.</p><p>Also responsible for compliance would be the company's board of directors. Additionally, the FTC will allege that Facebook misled users about how it used their phone numbers and even a facial recognition tool, in a complaint that accompanies the settlement.</p><p>The regulator's five-member board adopted the settlement deal in a 3-2 vote, the two votes against being from the panel's only Democrats, according to US media.</p><p>Investors saw the Democrats' votes as a sign that restrictions will not be overly severe, pushing share prices higher.</p><p>Initial negotiations had included tens of billions of dollars in fines and strict measures.</p><p>The personal data that Facebook collects from more than 2.7 billion users is its most valuable asset, which it uses to generate immense advertising revenue thanks to refined targeting capabilities.</p><p>It is precisely because of the way this data is used that the social network has found itself in hot water and is facing a serious crisis of confidence.</p><p>The FTC announced last year it reopened its investigation into a 2011 privacy settlement with Facebook after revelations that personal data on tens of millions of users was hijacked by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was working on the Donald Trump campaign in 2016.</p><p>However the $5 billion fine, the largest penalty ever imposed by the FTC for privacy violations, is not likely to affect the company's overall health \u2014 Facebook earned more than $22 billion in 2018 alone after hauling in $55 billion in total revenue.</p><p>The company will publish its quarterly earnings Wednesday after Wall Street closes, which will undoubtedly provide Zuckerberg an opportunity to speak on the matter.</p><p>He also could comment on the Justice Department's Tuesday announcement that it will launch a vast antitrust review of major online platforms, believed to include Facebook, to determine if they have \"stifled\" innovation or reduced competition.</p><p>\u2014 Washington Post</p><p> From left: Adam Cohen, the director of economic policy at Google; Matt Perault, the head of Global Policy Development at Facebook; Nate Sutton, the associate general counsel of competition at Amazon; and Kyle Andeer, the vice president of corporate law at Apple, are sworn in to testify before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, in Washington, July 16, 2019. The Justice Department said on July 23 that it would start an antitrust review into how powerful internet companies had accumulated market power and whether they had acted to reduce competition.

The new penalty highlighted how aggressively European authorities are pushing to regulate tech firms in areas like antitrust, privacy, taxes, and the spread of misinformation and hate speech.</p><p>The ruling strikes at a core element of Google's hugely profitable business model: providing phone makers such as Samsung and Huawei its Android operating system if they agree to prioritize its search bar, Chrome browser, and other apps over those of the company's rivals.</p><p>In addition to being hit with the hefty fine, Google must now decouple the Android system from its other services in Europe, potentially losing users and advertising revenue.</p><p>\"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\" said Margrethe Vestager, Europe's antitrust chief. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\"</p><p>The fine announced Wednesday, she said, \"reflects the seriousness and the sustained nature\" of Google's actions.</p><p>Regulators in Europe have already adopted tough new privacy rules that countries elsewhere are beginning to use as a template. Officials here have also investigated tech companies' tax practices, called for closer scrutiny of artificial intelligence, and added strict measures requiring social media companies to more forcefully combat false news and extremist content.</p><p>Under the decision, Google has 90 days to end its anti-competitive practices. If it fails to do so, it faces penalties of up to 5 percent of the worldwide average daily revenue of its parent company, Alphabet.</p><p>Google said it would appeal the decision, and the case is likely to drag on for years. The company must deposit the money in a holding account while the legal process unfolds. If it ultimately loses the appeal, the fine will be distributed among the EU's member states.</p><p>The ultimate effect of the ruling Wednesday may be muted, given that Europe has largely acted alone in taking regulatory action against Silicon Valley titans. Lawmakers and regulators in the United States have mostly taken a hands-off approach that has allowed big tech companies to expand their influence, though there have been signs recently of shifting attitudes and a tougher stance by Congress.</p><p>Google's services remain immensely popular with customers, and its stock price, profits, and revenue continue to soar. In the three years that the European Commission carried out its investigation, annual revenue for Alphabet grew to $111 billion from $75 billion. Google has also strengthened its dominance in the mobile phone market, with more than 1.25 billion Android handsets sold globally last year, according to the research firm IDC.</p><p>The EU's case against Google underscores the broader challenge regulators face in overseeing the digital economy. By the time authorities home in on an area deserving of scrutiny, the market may have moved on.</p><p>\"Fast-moving markets are where competition law is most important,\" said Jonathan Kanter, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss and a former antitrust investigator for the Federal Trade Commission. But \"when you have cases that are many years old, you're fighting old battles instead of the next one.\"</p><p>In the end, the fine's long-term impact may well be dwarfed by the changes to Android that Google is being forced to make.</p><p>The company has long portrayed the operating system as an open-source platform that hardware manufacturers can use and adapt based on their needs. But the European Commission said the system came with strings attached.</p><p>As part of the ruling, the commission is requiring Google to end policies that required handset makers to agree to make Google Search and Chrome the default services on Android-based devices to gain access to the latest versions of the system.</p><p>In addition, antitrust officials said Google must stop providing financial incentives to handset makers and wireless carriers to prioritize its services, and can no longer require manufacturers to sign agreements not to sell devices with modified versions of Android that do not include Google's apps.</p><p>In effect, the authorities said, Google had been negotiating terms that companies in the saturated smartphone market \u2014 where profit margins are razor thin \u2014 could not refuse.</p><p>The Silicon Valley giant's rivals cheered the decision. Locking handset-makers into deals with Google made it \"very challenging to compete,\" said Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine. \"We would hope the US would ultimately follow suit and take another look at this.\"</p><p>Google argued the European decision was an attack on its advertising-based business model. The company said it required handset makers to use its suite of apps as a way of recouping the billions of dollars it spends to make Android. The arrangement, the company says, allows manufacturers to compete with Apple's iPhones and iPads, by making phones and tablets of various designs and prices, while Google makes money through its services.</p><p>In a statement, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said the decision \"misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; to millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-71225690-8aca-11e8-9112-f8d50bd794ce</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV2-6GJ1-JC2G-C09J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Five billion dollars is a big number. If you spent it at the rate of $20 a second, it would take you about seven years and 11 months to spend it all. If you salted away $100 a day, it would take you nearly 137,000 years to have $5 billion (not counting interest earned).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Five billion dollars also can be a small number. If you're Facebook, for example, and you collect that sum in revenue in an average month and more than four times as much in profit in a single year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those are telling metrics. They help to explain what happened on July 12, minutes after a report surfaced that the Federal Trade Commission had voted to hit the company with a record $5-billion fine for violating the terms of a 2011 FTC settlement over privacy practices.</p><p>Facebook's stock price spiked upward, to about $205.30, gaining about $3 per share in the blink of an eye. The surge temporarily added about $7.5 billion to Facebook's market value, which most people might consider a win for the company. It gave up most of that gain before the start of the following trading day, but since then, with the $5-billion fine still hanging over the company, the shares have moved back toward the 52-week high of $217.50 they had reached on July 25, 2018.</p><p>Why would an unprecedented government penalty prompt a company's shares to move higher? There are two factors. One is that Facebook had been telegraphing for months that it expected a fine in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and already had accrued a reserve of $3 billion against that possibility. In other words, a stiff fine already was baked into the stock price.</p><p>The bigger reason, however, may be that investors concluded that the fine is basically the extent of the punishment being meted out to Facebook by the FTC for violations related to the breach of its users' privacy through the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica. All the details of the agency's action aren't known -- the initial July 12 report in the Wall Street Journal stated only the size of the financial penalty and the vote, which was 3 to 2 along party lines, Republicans in the majority. Facebook's critics say that if that's so, then the penalty is a slap on the wrist.</p><p>\"We've said that a large fine is necessary, but not sufficient,\" Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, told me. \"A lot more needs to be done,\" chiefly structural changes, including a forced divestment of the social media platforms Instagram and WhatsApp, which were competitors of Facebook until it acquired the first in 2012 for $1 billion and the second in 2014 for $19 billion. Both have become the focus of concerns over how Facebook collects and exploits the private personal information of their users. They're essential to Facebook's corporate strategy, which suggests that avoiding a divestment order may have made Facebook more amenable to a 10-figure fine.</p><p>Facebook's relationship with regulators is on everyone's radar screen right now. The FTC action, which may not be formally made public for weeks, is only one reason. There are also the calls by prominent Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other contenders for the presidential nomination, to break up Facebook and such other technology behemoths as Google and Amazon.</p><p>In unveiling her plan last March, Warren asserted that the big tech companies wield \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.... They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>The dominance of Facebook, along with a handful of other big firms, has broad implications for our economy. It may be showing up in what the Brookings Institution found to be an economywide decline in rates of start-ups -- especially among high-tech firms since 2000. One explanation is that \"increased market concentration is making the environment for start-ups inhospitable,\" Brookings said in a June 2018 report. (Officials of all three of the firms, plus Apple, appeared at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to defend their size and sweep and to counsel against breaking them up.)</p><p>Then there's Facebook's latest proposed venture. It's a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency dubbed Libra. As we've reported, Facebook has presented Libra as \"a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.\" But it really looks like a scheme to open a new path to profit and power for Facebook, dressed up as a global boon to billions of unsuspecting people.</p><p>Libra got fairly well raked over the coals in congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday. The lawmakers raised the most obvious point, which was why anyone should trust Facebook's promise that the privacy of Libra account holders would be safeguarded from breaches by, well, Facebook.</p><p>\"Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee in a fairly typical, if especially evocative, observation. \"We would be crazy to give them a chance to ... use powerful tools they don't understand, like monetary policy, to jeopardize hardworking Americans' ability to provide for their families.\"</p><p>Libra, however, is a speculative venture from which Facebook hopes to make money if it can sneak the idea past domestic and international currency regulators. What's more at stake in the proceedings before the FTC and in the calls for high-tech breakups are the existing businesses from which it earned more than $22 billion in profit last year.</p><p>EPIC's Rotenberg maintains that what Facebook most wants to avoid is government regulators interfering with its efforts to further integrate apps such as Whatsapp and Instagram into its ecosystem. \"They want to know that they can proceed largely without constraint,\" he says. \"They don't mind paying a price -- and $5 billion is a significant fine -- but they don't want to be obstructed as to their future market plans. That's why the share price went up\" after the FTC vote was leaked.</p><p>In his prepared remarks for a July 16 House Judiciary Committee hearing on the market power of tech's biggest players -- Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple -- Facebook spokesman Matt Perault cited his company's growth from \"a dorm room idea to a vibrant and successful American company that now employs almost 40,000 people around the world.\" He observed that \"Facebook is able to provide nearly all of its consumer services free of charge because we sell advertising.\" The spokesmen for Google, Amazon and Apple made analogous claims for their size, payrolls and benefits to consumers.</p><p>This was familiar big-corporation humbug, custom-built to obscure the real issues. The question isn't whether Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple have vast global reach, make pantsfuls of money and hire thousands of workers; that's a given for big consumer companies. The real questions are how much more would workers, entrepreneurs and the economy gain if their growth were reined in, and what are the hidden costs in allowing them to continue as they are? How much do Facebook users secretly pay for the loss of their privacy in return for \"free\" access to its services and apps? How much did American society pay, in the undermining of its democratic process, in return for allowing it to push disinformation, including some originated from Russian sources, to unsuspecting online viewers?</p><p>The terms \"privacy,\" \"FTC\" and \"Cambridge Analytica\" didn't appear in Perault's prepared statement. But the reason for Facebook's current regulatory issues is that the company and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have demonstrated time and again that their promises to users and their commitments to government regulators can't be trusted. They break their promises and commitments all the time.</p><p>When they're caught, they either brush off the implications of their behavior as no big deal, or they cop to their wrongdoing and promise not to do it again, pleading that \"We really messed this one up,\" \"We simply did a bad job with this release,\" or \"Sometimes we move too fast.\" As we observed during a privacy blowup in 2014, this always boils down to the all-purpose plea of \"guilty, with an explanation.\"</p><p>The FTC's 2011 settlement involved allegations that Facebook had systematically deceived its users into thinking their privacy settings would keep their personal information from flowing to strangers and that the company falsely told users it wouldn't share their identities with advertisers without the users' consent. The settlement required the company to stop misrepresenting its privacy protections and to obtain express consent from users before overriding their privacy settings. Yet as the company acknowledged last year, the personal information of as many as 87 million people ended up shared with the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica, which then allegedly used it on behalf of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and the pro-Brexit campaign in Britain.</p><p>Last year, the FTC said it would open an investigation into the Cambridge Analytica affair. As EPIC noted in a letter to the FTC in January, up to that moment it had never imposed any discipline on Facebook for possible breaches of the 2011 settlement. \"We've spent the last eight years trying to get the consent order enforced,\" said Rotenberg, whose organization brought the initial complaint that ultimately yielded the settlement. Cambridge Analytica was only one example of a data breach. Last year Jan Koum, the founder of WhatsApp, left Facebook reportedly over a disagreement with Facebook's decision to start accessing the private data of users of WhatsApp, which was built on the promise of absolute data security.</p><p>The fact is that even a multibillion-dollar fine won't dissuade Facebook from pursuing its quest to monetize the private information of its unwitting or uncaring users, and indulging its worst instincts in doing so. Not $5 billion, not $10 billion. Facebook makes too much money for even that much to have a lasting effect, and its potential for making even more is incalculable. The only thing that will work is regulation, up to and including a breakup.</p><p>The lawmakers who laced into Facebook during committee hearings Tuesday and Wednesday certainly sounded serious about holding the company to its commitments on user privacy. But one wonders if they would be so outspoken if they really intended to do something about it, and to force the FTC to do its job of regulation. Facebook made $7 million in campaign contributions to federal candidates in 2016 and 2018, and spent $55 million on Washington lobbying just since 2014. Consumers should be nervous; when big companies come to Washington, they almost always get their way.</p><p>--</p><p>Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

It would be the biggest fine by far levied by the federal government against a technology company, easily eclipsing the $22 million imposed on Google in 2012. The size of the penalty underscored the rising frustration among Washington officials with how Silicon Valley giants collect, store and use people's information. </p><p>  It would also represent one of the most aggressive regulatory actions by the Trump administration, and a sign of the government's willingness to punish one of the country's biggest and most powerful companies. President Trump has dialed back regulations in many industries, but the Facebook settlement sets a new bar for privacy enforcement by United States officials, who have brought few cases against large technology companies.</p><p>  In addition to the fine, Facebook agreed to more comprehensive oversight of how it handles user data, according to the people. But none of the conditions in the settlement will impose strict limitations on Facebook's ability to collect and share data with third parties. And that decision appeared to help split the five-member commission. The 3-to-2 vote, taken in secret this week, drew the dissent of the two Democrats on the commission because they sought stricter limits on the company, the people said.</p><p>  Until now, the biggest fines and restrictions against tech companies have come from Europe. Officials there have imposed several charges of antitrust and privacy laws against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Last year, the European Union fined Google $5.1 billion for abusing its large market share in the mobile phone industry. More recently, numerous officials and lawmakers around the world have rushed to regulate Facebook.</p><p>  The F.T.C.'s investigation was set off by The New York Times and The Observer of London, which uncovered that the social network allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest personal information of its users. The firm used the data to build political profiles about individuals without the consent of Facebook users.</p><p>  The agency found that Facebook's handling of user data violated a 2011 privacy settlement with the F.T.C. That earlier settlement, which came after the company was accused of deceiving people about how it handled their data, required the company to revamp its privacy practices.</p><p>  American regulators and lawmakers of both parties have also taken a more combative stance toward the tech giants in recent weeks. Congress started an antitrust investigation into how the biggest tech companies have harmed consumers and impeded competition. The Justice Department and the F.T.C. divvied up responsibility for potential antitrust investigations into several of the companies.</p><p>  On Thursday, Mr. Trump took shots at Facebook and other social media companies, accusing them of being biased against conservatives. He also took to Twitter to criticize Facebook's latest initiative into cryptocurrency -- a project called Libra, which is still in its early stages -- saying that Facebook's proposed coin would never usurp the dollar. David Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of Libra, is scheduled to appear before Congress next week to explain and defend the initiative.</p><p>  Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the F.T.C., declined to comment.</p><p>  Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, also declined to comment.</p><p>  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the vote by the commission.</p><p>  The commissioners agreed many months ago to pursue a substantial penalty against the company, in an effort to show the agency's teeth, according to several people briefed on the discussions. But they were split on the size and scope of the tech company's punishment. One of the most contentious issues was whether Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, should be held personally liable for any violation of the 2011 agreement.</p><p>  The internal debate mirrored the larger debate in Washington over just how far the government should go to regulate Big Tech.</p><p>  Many Democrats and Republicans have thrown their support behind privacy regulations. But some Democrats, including presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called for breaking up some of the biggest companies.</p><p>  Lawmakers urged the F.T.C. to be aggressive in its investigation of Facebook. The agency oversees deceptive and unfair business practices. It is also the main watchdog for the internet industry that protect users privacy by policing companies for misleading users on how their personal data is collected and shared.</p><p>  New revelations of privacy violations reported throughout the year added to evidence of problems at the company but also complicated the ability of the F.T.C. to conclude its inquiry.</p><p>  Republicans said little about the F.T.C. vote on Friday. But numerous Democrats said the agency did not go far enough.</p><p>  ''The F.T.C. just gave Facebook a Christmas present five months early,'' Representative David Cicilline, Democrat from Rhode Island, said in a statement. ''It's very disappointing that such an enormously powerful company that engaged in such serious misconduct is getting a slap on the wrist.''</p><p>  Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that meaningful enforcement of Facebook would have included deep structural reforms. Without that, he said, ''the message to the world is that, sadly, American consumer privacy protection is a hollow paper tiger, which is deeply disappointing.''</p><p>  Despite all the criticism of the company, it has continued to do well financially. The social network reaped more than $55 billion in revenue in 2018 -- 10 times the amount of the fine approved by the commission -- as the digital advertising industry has consolidated to increasingly drive dollars to a handful of tech companies.</p><p>  In April, Facebook reported a record first quarter of revenue of nearly $15 billion. And the company is sitting on more than $40 billion in cash reserves.</p><p>  Shares of Facebook rose to $205.27 -- the stock's highest price in the past year -- in after-hours trading on Friday after news of the vote became public.</p><p>  Some privacy and consumer advocates pointed to the company's value on Wall Street as proof that the settlement would not curb the company's behavior.</p><p>  ''It's a bad sign that markets are reacting to Facebook's settlement with the F.T.C. by jumping the value of the company's stock,'' Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a consumer interest group, said in a statement.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-779091190713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-6WX1-JBG3-606X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html</url><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 13, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The FTC vote on the deal was split 3-2 along party lines at the Republican-controlled agency, insiders said, a signal that Democratic commissioners didn't feel the settlement was sufficiently tough.</p><p>Facebook's other political and regulatory issues are in earlier stages. This week, the social-media giant is sending executives to two Capitol Hill oversight hearings: one examining whether action is needed to rein in the market power of big tech companies, and another focused on Libra, the cryptocurrency Facebook is planning to launch with other corporate partners.</p><p>Last week, Donald Trump criticised social-media companies at a White House event and suggested regulatory proposals may be coming. Abroad, Ireland's privacy regulator alone is pursuing 10 investigations related to Facebook's gathering and processing of personal data.</p><p>US politicians of both parties have already signalled they would view a $US5bn payment sent to the US Treasury as too weak, and early reaction to the FTC deal suggests it won't stem momentum behind policies aimed at large tech firms.</p><p>\"I don't want to pooh-pooh a $US5bn settlement, but this is a company that generates multiples of that per quarter,\" Democrat senator Mark Warner said, referring to Facebook's revenue, which was $US15.08bn in the first quarter of the year.</p><p>He said structural changes were needed to improve how large tech companies operated with respect to personal data, the spread of misinformation and other issues. \"FTC fines may or may not change behaviour, and they sure as heck don't change incentives,\" he said.</p><p>The settlement is expected to impose other requirements on Facebook but the details of those terms aren't yet known.</p><p>The FTC probe began after disclosures last year that the owner of a quiz app scraped personal data on tens of millions of Facebook users and their friends, and shared it with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The app had violated Facebook's policies, but the event highlighted lax controls over Facebook apps.Cambridge Analytica used personal data to help political campaigns influence voters. It worked for several Republican campaigns in 2016, including Mr Trump's.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-98295f32a5df11e99c8b54147e35a7455359837cd392444e4a1c7784cf018da1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJW-BPF1-JD3N-53CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It finds CBA is best placed to respond given its large technology budget and the functionality of its banking app, which Morgan Stanley rates as best among the big four.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, the latest in the investment bank's \"Australia in Transition\" series, comes a day after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/cba-accelerates-digital-banking-innovation-20190528-p51rxd\">CBA chief executive Matt Comyn announced the bank would add a host of new features to its app</url> to drive customers towards its own digital wallet. He said CBA had 2 million customers already using its digital wallet.</p><p>But Morgan Stanley said customers could find digital wallets provided by Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and PayPal more attractive, because they allow various cards and accounts from different financial firms to be linked, whereas the banks' wallets only offer their own products.</p><p>\"Payments are key to the next decade of banks' growth,\" says the report, titled The Disruption we Have to Have. It has been prepared by the Morgan Stanley equities team ahead of its inaugural Australia summit branded Disruption Decoded, which is on in Sydney next week.</p><p>A key theme of the report, which also covers the consumer, software and media sectors, is that radical changes in technology make the effect on incumbent business models \"an increasingly key component of the investment decision making process\".</p><p>While direct revenue from providing payments is a smaller proportion of overall bank revenue than the $22 billion number, the report examines how banks' payments capability influences decisions relating to other products, such as the transaction accounts that give major banks with a low-cost source of funding and avenue to cross-sell customers more profitable products such as mortgages.</p><p>Roy Morgan data from January found 6.8 per cent of Australians were using digital payments services offered by big tech companies, compared to 5.8 per cent using banks' own mobile apps.</p><p>\"We think increasingly customers are likely to base their decision [on who to bank with] on the features in the app, and a lot of those features are payments-related,\" said Richard Wiles, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley and co-author of the report. \"The capacity around payments drives decisions on which transaction account and which bank you choose as your main financial institution.\"</p><p>Regulatory settings in Australia are encouraging new players and the concentrated retail environment also supports the rapid take-up of digital wallets, the report says. It notes the Council of Financial Regulators is reviewing the regulation of \"stored-value facilities\", which could result in more global technologies holding retail funds to facilitate payments.</p><p>Currently, PayPal has a limited authorised deposit-taking institution licence for this purpose; the report said \"a simpler regulatory framework could allow other digital wallets to offer similar services\".</p><p>With CBA saying on Tuesday it would spend $5 billion on technology over the next five years, Morgan Stanley says banks will have to continue to lift investment to compete with big tech, meaning targets to reduce absolute costs over the short term are merely aspirational. Yet despite more dollars being pumped into more digital features, the \"risk is skewed to the downside\" and under a bear case scenario, the investment bank said it might have to downgrade major bank earnings by 10 per cent.</p><p>The rising power of Apple and Google will also be supported by the government's open banking policy, by allowing them to integrate more customer data into their own wallets.</p><p>Morgan Stanley's analysis of the functionality of the banking apps of the four majors shows CBA has the most advanced features, while ANZ is the laggard.</p><p>Banks would prefer customers pay through their own application rather than the wallets of global tech companies because this allows them to keep more of the interchange commission and also retain a closer customer relationship.</p><p>But Morgan Stanley said banks will be at a disadvantage if their apps only provide their own cards and products, because many customers will want to use tech companies to allow them to use services from a range of institutions.</p><p>The report provides additional insight into the power of open banking, which banks will begin testing in July. The regime in Australia will not allow third parties to conduct payments, in contrast with Europe. But if Australia did introduce \"write access\" as part of its regime, this would allow digital wallets to \"sweep lazy money out of bank transaction accounts into higher cost deposits, and deposits could leave the incumbent banks altogether if digital wallet providers apply for e-money or banking licences,\" the report says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520135906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W70-FDC1-DY19-C2FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>04:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The expanding definition of fintech and its increasing reach and interconnectivity helped keep fintech investment robust despite the global economic and trade challenges that hindered growth in 2019, including concerns related to Brexit and ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, said the report.</p><p>In fact, despite these concerns, cross-border transactions remained high with $54.2 billion in cross-border M&amp;A deal value across 138 deals. This focus on cross-border transactions will likely continue as maturing fintechs look to grow and achieve scale and the big tech giants look to extend their reach and gain market share in less developed markets, it said.</p><p>Many niche areas of fintech continued to grow and evolve throughout 2019; in particular, proptech investment grew from $1.9 billion in 2018 to a record $2.6 billion in 2019, while fintech-focused cybersecurity investment more than doubled from $316.9 million to $646.2 million. Blockchain and cryptocurrency investment continued to fluctuate, falling from $6.3 billion to $4.7 billion year-over-year, although Facebook's announcement of Libra and the People's Bank of China's announcement of accelerated research and experimentation on digital currency and electronic payments have helped breathe new life into the space.</p><p>2019 Key Global Highlights* Global fintech investment fell just short of 2018's record year, with $137.5 billion invested in 2019 compared to $141 billion in 2018.* Global corporate VC investment participation rose during every quarter of 2019, leading to $16.7 billion in total annual VC invested with CVC involvement; CVC-related deal volume was also robust, with 553 deals over 2019, including 166 in Q3'19 \u2013 the second-highest quarter ever in terms of CVC fintech deals volume after Q2'18.* The number of fintech deals by global tech giants \u2013 including Alibaba Group, Alphabet, Apple, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft and Tencent \u2013 increased for the fifth straight year, with $3.5 billion invested across 46 deals in 2019.* Cybersecurity related fintech investment more than doubled year-over-year, from $316.9 million to $646.2 million. Proptech investment rose to a record high of $2.6 billion in 2019 from $1.9 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to Manav Prakash, Advisory Partner at KPMG in Bahrain: \"In 2020, the lines are going to continue to blur between financial services and non-financial services \u2013 with big techs like Alibaba, Tencent, Google and others continuing to look for ways to integrate financial services within their ecosystem of offerings to their customers. Integration will be a big priority and the unbundling of financial services that has occurred over the past few years will likely start to reverse as fintechs, traditional financial institutions, and big techs look to provide more value and more seamless experiences to their customers.\"</p><p>Key Predictions for 2020* The big tech giants like Alphabet, Alibaba and Tencent will increase their focus on the fintech space, both working to increase their reach into developing markets and to increase the value of their ecosystems to their customers.* Maturing fintechs and challenger banks will continue to expand the breadth of their service offerings beyond their initial niche focus areas and make strategic moves across international borders.* The unbundling of financial products will begin to reverse course as consumers increasingly seek a primary interface to manage all of their financial affairs on a holistic level.* Cybersecurity-focused fintechs will become more attractive as traditional financial institutions shift from building to buying cyber solutions, particularly in areas like fraud, security, and identity management.* Consolidation is going to increase, with bigger and bolder M&amp;A deals becoming the norm in more mature fintech sub-sectors.* Building on the momentum of Hong Kong (SAR) and Australia, more countries in the Asia Pacific region will develop digital banking regimes and use digital banking licenses to guide digital bank efforts.* The focus on open data opportunities will move beyond banking and into other aspects of the financial services industry.</p><p>Anthony Harris, Head of Digital and Innovation at KPMG in Bahrain, notes: \"Regulators are increasingly allowing new Fintech entrants into their financial sectors in order to accelerate industry transformation. And as the Fintech-driven unbundling of incumbent financial institutions' product portfolios hits a peak, the race is now on to re-bundle services and experiences around customer-centric, data-driven platforms. Competition is coming from Neo Banks, Fintechs as they look to scale, and Technology Platform Challengers such as Amazon, WeChat, Alibaba. Firms that effectively orchestrate platform or ecosystem environments typically end up as the winners.\" \u2013 TradeArabia News Serivce</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRARAB-169634000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRARAB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-0SD1-F11P-X2T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335146</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TradeArabia - Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group.

The committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\"</p><p/><p>Mr Rieder said the Fed will face two choices in the period ahead.</p><p>In his view it could either: \"Keep monetary policy easy for years in hopes of hitting its elusive 2 per cent inflation target, while risking a bubble in financial conditions as equities outpace the economy and depressed bond yields feed overzealous risk-taking, or it can seek to normalize policy alongside of eventual labor market healing.

It takes some getting to: ten days in a boat followed by a long, dark dive in a submarine about 2,000 feet beneath the surface. But just before you reach the bottom, you see will it and it will take your breath away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tall, eerie, white spines of rock reach up from the seabed. Delicate chimneys of calcium carbonate, tall as a skyscraper and more intricate than a cathedral spire. There are plenty of unusual features and creatures at the bottom of the oceans but there is something special about this patch of the mid-Atlantic ridge, which has become known as the Lost City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a start, the columns are far taller than those you'll find elsewhere, towering up to 200 feet. And unlike the hot black smokers you may have seen in wildlife documentaries, the ones in the Lost City are not the product of volcanic activity. Instead they spout lukewarm water and teem with microscopic marine life. Which brings us to the most extraordinary thing of all. In a process scientists are still trying to understand, hydrocarbons - the building blocks of life - are being created spontaneously in a chemical reaction between seawater and the rocks.</p><p>We have spent centuries searching for the origins of life. Most experts believe it emerged from the water: Darwin spoke of it coming from a \"warm little pond\". The chimneys of the Lost City might be the closest we have come to an answer. If scientists are right, life on Earth began somewhere like the Lost City, three or four billion years ago.</p><p>It's not surprising that it took so long to stumble on them. After all, we know less about the seabed than we do about the surface of the moon and Mars. While we have a vague idea about the depth of the sea, comprehensive maps exist for only 5 or maybe 10 per cent of the ocean floor. Most of the detail we have relates to the shallow seas around our coastlines; what we know about deeper waters is often down to chance.</p><p>It was thus with the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight Mhl0, which failed to find the wreckage but did reveal the existence of enormous underwater mountains larger than Mount Everest, chains of volcanoes hundreds of miles long, and rich wildlife deep beneath the Indian Ocean. And it was thus with the Lost City, discovered by chance one night by a scientist on a completely unrelated exploration in the Atlantic.</p><p>So important is the Lost City that Unesco, the UN agency charged with protecting the world's wonders, recently declared that it should be a protected world heritage site, alongside the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal. There is a problem, though: those sites need to be located within countries; the Lost City is thousands of miles from any coast. It is owned by no country and is classed as being the \"common heritage of mankind\".</p><p>This is more than a mere legal technicality. The fact that the high seas are a diplomatic grey area means that there is nothing to stop us using them as a vast communal dustbin or, as mining companies are beginning to do, exploiting their hidden riches. The only organisation charged with safeguarding the ocean floor is the International Seabed Authority (ISA). This UN agency, headquartered in a ramshackle office in Jamaica, is on the front line of a new global conservation battle.</p><p>The notion that there are untold riches lying on the sea floor goes back to the 19th century when HMS Challenger, a Royal Navy ship, dredged up a haul of polymetallic nodules from the seabed. These potato-sized lumps of ore, formed over millions of years, were astoundingly rich. So are the other mineral formations we have subsequently discovered: cobalt crusts on the top of undersea ridges and deposits left by volcanic vents which spurt out sulphurous fumes of 400C.</p><p>These days if you want to extract a tonne of gold from the ground you will have to tear down the best part of a mountain, so thinly spread are deposits of the metal. By contrast, the amount of metal in many subsea deposits can be between 10 and 50,000 times more concentrated. One study suggested that there is enough gold on the sea floor for every person on the planet to have 9lb of the stuff, equivalent to $170,000 apiece. Such estimates involve a heroic amount of guesswork, but we do know that the vast majority of the world's known resources of metals such as cobalt and tellurium is to be found underwater.</p><p>To understand why that matters, consider the report last month that Apple is in talks to buy cobalt directly from miners. Cobalt, it turns out, is one of the most important ingredients of lithium ion batteries: the cells that power all sorts of devices, from phones and tablets to electric cars. The price of the metal has nearly tripled in the past year. That's partly explained by demand: we're buying more smartphones and electric cars. But it's also down to supply: we are running out of terrestrial stocks of cobalt. Moreover, the majority of what's left comes from the wartorn Democratic Republic of Congo, where children as young as seven work in the mines, and environmental conditions are dismal.</p><p>That poses a dilemma for Apple, Tesla and other big tech companies that depend on batteries: how do they ensure an affordable supply of this essential element while keeping their promise to consumers that they will be ethically sourced? The same thing goes for solar panel manufacturers, who need tellurium for the next generation of arrays.</p><p>For entrepreneurs such as Gerard Barron, the answer lies beneath the waves. His company, DeepGreen Resources, is planning to hoover up those nodules from the seabed and market the resulting copper and cobalt as the world's first truly green metal. Why drive a car whose battery may have been the product of child labour or rainforest destruction when you can drive one with a truly sustainable kitemark?</p><p>DeepGreen has a contract to explore for the minerals in the Clarion Clipperton Zone, far out in the middle of the Pacific. And while it will take time before true deep-sea mining becomes a reality, the advent of new robot technology is bringing that moment closer than ever. Last year a Japanese team successfully mined subsea deposits off its coastline. A Canadian company, Nautilus, is poised to begin operations off Papua New Guinea within months. Soon enough the high seas, where much of this mineral wealth is thought to be found, will become the site of the next great gold rush.</p><p>In its effort to manage this process, the ISA has spent the past few years handing out exploration licences to various countries. Patches of the seabed in the Pacific and Atlantic have already been allotted: China is the frontrunner, with a number of contracts and a determination to be the first country to extract large quantities. Russia is also heavily involved, as is Britain, though mainly as a sponsor for American firms, some with colourful histories. One of those companies, defence giant Lockheed Martin, was associated with a marine mining effort back in the 1970s; it later transpired that this project was a front for a CIA attempt to pull a sunken USSR submarine off the seafloor.</p><p>The ISA's defining goal is that we will all, one way or another, benefit from the exploitation of this new frontier. When extraction finally begins each country will have to share its royalties with every other country in the world - so honouring that \"common heritage of mankind\" clause.</p><p>But environmentalists worry that the windfalls will not compensate for the cost and ecological impact. They argue that the sea floor is one of the planet's most pristine, biodiverse habitats; that species could be destroyed before they are fully understood. Indeed, the majority of creatures on the seabed are so varied and unfamiliar that they have not been named yet, let alone studied in detail.</p><p>They represent an ecosystem we are still barely beginning to understand. Until a few decades ago scientists had assumed that all life on Earth was directly or indirectly reliant on oxygen or the sun. They thought the seabed was effectively barren. They could hardly have been more wrong.</p><p>We now know there are countless creatures living on the bottom of the sea, many of them reliant on chemical energy rather than light: chemosynthesis as opposed to photosynthesis. There are eerie specimens such as the so-called faceless fish discovered last year in seas 4km deep off the coast of Australia. There are snails, crabs and urchins, alien-looking shrimps, sponges and giant tube worms without mouths or digestive tracts.</p><p>Biologists believe that we are barely scratching the surface of understanding this new habitat. It might well be possible to extract minerals from some areas without causing too much disturbance. But until more environmental tests are done, we simply won't know.</p><p>The ISA's argument is that opening up the seabed to mining will only improve our understanding of this realm. But some suspect the institution is being naive. They worry not merely about miners crushing creatures in the gears of their machines but about the plumes of dust and sand thrown up by the mining process. Some simulations have suggested the debris could be carried hundreds of miles, effectively polluting undisturbed habitats elsewhere on the seafloor. Fishing groups worry about toxins being consumed by fish and entering the food chain. Then again, early studies by the National Oceanographic Centre in Southampton suggest the plumes could be far smaller and less damaging than environmentalists fear.</p><p>All the same, there is genuine concern about what could be lost if we unwittingly pollute the seabed. Researchers are using an ever-increasing number of compounds from sea flora and fauna as ingredients for new medicines. They suggest that the cure for cancer, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease could be destroyed before we find it. Some even worry that transferring organisms up from the deep, where they have had no contact with mankind since the dawn of time, could risk the release of dangerous compounds or viruses that could cause pandemics.</p><p>Others question whether the ISA is equipped to manage the process. While terrestrial mining regulators tend to have hundreds of employees constantly conducting spot checks on the sites they oversee, the ISA does not even own a helicopter or a boat. Indeed, when I visited the place recently, the offices looked half-empty. The secretary-general, a British lawyer called Michael Lodge, insisted that the institution was extremely rigorous with its decisions about who to award exploration licences to. I asked whether the ISA had ever rejected a licence application. Not yet, he said.</p><p>Earlier this month the ISA held a seminal meeting to begin working out the rules for deep-sea mining. As is the tradition, many of the crucial meetings were held in private, their recommendations rubber-stamped by the membership. When no one is paying you much attention (few politicians, let alone members of the public, have heard of the ISA) there is not much incentive to be all that transparent.</p><p>Which explains why it has taken until now for one of the ISA's most controversial decisions to be reported. A few months ago, the ISA designated a 10,000 sq km section of the mid-Atlantic ridge to Poland for mining exploration. On the face of it there is nothing untoward about this: France and Russia have analogous rights to patches of the ridge. But Poland's zone is a little different: it contains that precious patch of carbonate towers scientists called the Lost City.</p><p>The fact that one of the world's most important sites of scientific interest, a place which might hold the secrets to the origins of life on this planet and on other planets, is now part of a mining exploration site is shocking. Ocean geologists and biologists, including the team that discovered the place, have sent letters to the ISA expressing their concern. To date, they have received no reply.</p><p>No one is suggesting that Poland is about to tear down the Lost City - for one thing there are no precious metals in those tall, white towers. However, with the ISA yet to devise the rules, there is no legal sanction. They could tear them down, destroying the only clues we have of how life began, and there would be nothing that anyone could do about it.</p><p>So why isn't everyone making more fuss about this? The first answer is that few people are yet aware of the imminence of deep-sea mining. Second, we are caught on the horns of a dilemma. If we want electric cars we will need cobalt from the seabed. If we want solar panels we will need tellurium.</p><p>In much the same way as the quest for oil defined the physical economy - and much of the statecraft-- of the 20th century, the quest for minerals to power an electric future is likely to define the 21st, taking us into deeply uncomfortable territory.Ed Conway's documentary on the ocean economy, In Too Deep, is available on demand on Sky and YouTube</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-42365795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWF-5SR1-JCJY-G291-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2161\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

It takes some getting to: ten days in a boat followed by a long, dark dive in a submarine about 2,000 feet beneath the surface. But just before you reach the bottom, you will see it and it will take your breath away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tall, eerie white spines of rock reach up from the seabed. Delicate chimneys of calcium carbonate, tall as a skyscraper and more intricate than a cathedral spire. There are plenty of unusual features and creatures at the bottom of the oceans but there is something special about this patch of the mid-Atlantic ridge, which has become known as the Lost City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a start, the columns are far taller than those you'll find elsewhere, towering up to 200 feet. And unlike the hot black smokers you may have seen in wildlife documentaries, the ones in the Lost City are not the product of volcanic activity. Instead they spout lukewarm water and teem with microscopic marine life.</p><p>Which brings us to the most extraordinary thing of all: in a process scientists are still trying to understand, hydrocarbons - the building blocks of life - are being created spontaneously in a chemical reaction between seawater and the rocks.</p><p>We have spent centuries searching for the origins of life. Most experts believe it emerged from the water: Darwin spoke of it coming from a \"warm little pond\". The chimneys of the Lost City might be the closest we have come to an answer. If scientists are right, life on Earth began somewhere like the Lost City, three or four billion years ago. It's not surprising that it took so long to stumble on them. After all, we know less about the seabed than we do about the surface of the moon and Mars. While we have a vague idea about the depth of the sea, comprehensive maps exist for only 5 or maybe 10 per cent of the ocean floor. Most of the detail we have relates to the shallow seas around our coastlines; what we know about deeper waters is often down to chance.</p><p>It was thus with the search for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, which failed to find the wreckage but did reveal the existence of enormous underwater mountains larger than Mount Everest, chains of volcanoes hundreds of miles long, and rich wildlife deep beneath the Indian Ocean. And it was thus with the Lost City, discovered by chance one night by a scientist on a completely unrelated exploration in the Atlantic. So important is the Lost City that Unesco, the UN agency charged with protecting the world's wonders, recently declared that it should be a protected world heritage site, alongside the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal. There is a problem, though. Those sites need to be located within countries; the Lost City is thousands of miles from any coast. It is owned by no country and is classed as being the \"common heritage of mankind\".</p><p>This is more than a mere legal technicality. The fact that the high seas are a diplomatic grey area means that there is nothing to stop us using them as a vast communal dustbin or, as mining companies are beginning to do, exploiting their hidden riches. The only organisation charged with safeguarding the ocean floor is the International Seabed Authority (ISA). This UN agency, headquartered in a ramshackle office in Jamaica, is on the front line of a new global conservation battle.</p><p>The notion that there are untold riches lying on the sea floor goes back to the 19th century when HMS Challenger, a Royal Navy ship, dredged up a haul of polymetallic nodules from the seabed. These potatosized lumps of ore, formed over millions of years, were astoundingly rich. So are the other mineral formations we have subsequently discovered: cobalt crusts on the top of undersea ridges and deposits left by volcanic vents which spurt out sulphurous fumes of 400C.</p><p>These days if you want to extract a tonne of gold from the ground you will have to tear down the best part of a mountain, so thinly spread are deposits of the metal. By contrast, the amount of metal in many subsea deposits can be between 10 and 50,000 times more concentrated. One study suggested that there is enough gold on the sea floor for every person on the planet to have 9lb of the stuff, equivalent to $170,000 apiece. Such estimates involve a heroic amount of guesswork, but we do know that the vast majority of the world's known resources of metals such as cobalt and tellurium is to be found underwater.</p><p>To understand why that matters, consider the report last month that Apple is in talks to buy cobalt directly from miners. Cobalt, it turns out, is one of the most important ingredients of lithium ion batteries, the cells that power all sorts of devices, from phones and tablets to electric cars. The price of the metal has nearly tripled in the past year. That's partly explained by demand: we're buying more smartphones and electric cars. But it's also down to supply: we are running out of terrestrial stocks of cobalt. Moreover, the majority of what's left comes from the wartorn Democratic Republic of Congo, where children as young as seven work in the mines and environmental conditions are dismal.</p><p>That poses a dilemma for Apple, Tesla and other big tech companies that depend on batteries: how do they ensure an affordable supply of this essential element while keeping their promise to consumers that they will be ethically sourced? The same thing goes for solar panel manufacturers, who need tellurium for the next generation of arrays. For entrepreneurs such as Gerard Barron, the answer lies beneath the waves. His company, DeepGreen Resources, is planning to hoover up those nodules from the seabed and market the resulting copper and cobalt as the world's first truly green metal. Why drive a car whose battery may have been the product of child labour or rainforest destruction when you can drive one with a truly sustainable kitemark? DeepGreen has a contract to explore for the minerals in the Clarion Clipperton Zone, far out in the middle of the Pacific. And while it will take time before true deep-sea mining becomes a reality, the advent of new robot technology is bringing that moment closer than ever.

It takes some getting to: ten days in a boat followed by a long, dark dive in a submarine about 2,000 feet beneath the surface. But just before you reach the bottom, you will see it and it will take your breath away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tall, eerie white spines of rock reach up from the seabed. Delicate chimneys of calcium carbonate, tall as a skyscraper and more intricate than a cathedral spire. There are plenty of unusual features and creatures at the bottom of the oceans but there is something special about this patch of the mid-Atlantic ridge, which has become known as the Lost City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a start, the columns are far taller than those you'll find elsewhere, towering up to 200 feet. And unlike the hot black smokers you may have seen in wildlife documentaries, the ones in the Lost City are not the product of volcanic activity. Instead they spout lukewarm water and teem with microscopic marine life. Which brings us to the most extraordinary thing of all: in a process scientists are still trying to understand, hydrocarbons - the building blocks of life - are being created spontaneously in a chemical reaction between seawater and the rocks.</p><p>We have spent centuries searching for the origins of life. Most experts believe it emerged from the water: Darwin spoke of it coming from a \"warm little pond\". The chimneys of the Lost City might be the closest we have come to an answer. If scientists are right, life on Earth began somewhere like the Lost City, three or four billion years ago. It's not surprising that it took so long to stumble on them. After all, we know less about the seabed than we do about the surface of the moon and Mars. While we have a vague idea about the depth of the sea, comprehensive maps exist for only 5 or maybe 10 per cent of the ocean floor. Most of the detail we have relates to the shallow seas around our coastlines; what we know about deeper waters is often down to chance.</p><p>It was thus with the search for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, which failed to find the wreckage but did reveal the existence of enormous underwater mountains larger than Mount Everest, chains of volcanoes hundreds of miles long, and rich wildlife deep beneath the Indian Ocean. And it was thus with the Lost City, discovered by chance one night by a scientist on a completely unrelated exploration in the Atlantic. So important is the Lost City that Unesco, the UN agency charged with protecting the world's wonders, recently declared that it should be a protected world heritage site, alongside the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal. There is a problem, though. Those sites need to be located within countries; the Lost City is thousands of miles from any coast. It is owned by no country and is classed as being the \"common heritage of mankind\".</p><p>This is more than a mere legal technicality. The fact that the high seas are a diplomatic grey area means that there is nothing to stop us using them as a vast communal dustbin or, as mining companies are beginning to do, exploiting their hidden riches. The only organisation charged with safeguarding the ocean floor is the International Seabed Authority (ISA). This UN agency, headquartered in a ramshackle office in Jamaica, is on the front line of a new global conservation battle.</p><p>The notion that there are untold riches lying on the sea floor goes back to the 19th century when HMS Challenger, a Royal Navy ship, dredged up a haul of polymetallic nodules from the seabed. These potatosized lumps of ore, formed over millions of years, were astoundingly rich. So are the other mineral formations we have subsequently discovered: cobalt crusts on the top of undersea ridges and deposits left by volcanic vents which spurt out sulphurous fumes of 400C.</p><p>These days if you want to extract a tonne of gold from the ground you will have to tear down the best part of a mountain, so thinly spread are deposits of the metal. By contrast, the amount of metal in many subsea deposits can be between 10 and 50,000 times more concentrated. One study suggested that there is enough gold on the sea floor for every person on the planet to have 9lb of the stuff, equivalent to $170,000 apiece. Such estimates involve a heroic amount of guesswork, but we do know that the vast majority of the world's known resources of metals such as cobalt and tellurium is to be found underwater.</p><p>To understand why that matters, consider the report last month that Apple is in talks to buy cobalt directly from miners. Cobalt, it turns out, is one of the most important ingredients of lithium ion batteries, the cells that power all sorts of devices, from phones and tablets to electric cars. The price of the metal has nearly tripled in the past year. That's partly explained by demand: we're buying more smartphones and electric cars. But it's also down to supply: we are running out of terrestrial stocks of cobalt. Moreover, the majority of what's left comes from the wartorn Democratic Republic of Congo, where children as young as seven work in the mines and environmental conditions are dismal.</p><p>That poses a dilemma for Apple, Tesla and other big tech companies that depend on batteries: how do they ensure an affordable supply of this essential element while keeping their promise to consumers that they will be ethically sourced? The same thing goes for solar panel manufacturers, who need tellurium for the next generation of arrays. For entrepreneurs such as Gerard Barron, the answer lies beneath the waves. His company, DeepGreen Resources, is planning to hoover up those nodules from the seabed and market the resulting copper and cobalt as the world's first truly green metal. Why drive a car whose battery may have been the product of child labour or rainforest destruction when you can drive one with a truly sustainable kitemark? DeepGreen has a contract to explore for the minerals in the Clarion Clipperton Zone, far out in the middle of the Pacific. And while it will take time before true deep-sea mining becomes a reality, the advent of new robot technology is bringing that moment closer than ever. Last year a Japanese team successfully mined subsea deposits off its coastline. A Canadian company, Nautilus, is poised to begin operations off Papua New Guinea within months.</p><p>Soon enough the high seas, where much of this mineral wealth is thought to be found, will become the site of the next great gold rush.</p><p>In its effort to manage this process, the ISA has spent the past few years handing out exploration licences to various countries. Patches of the seabed in the Pacific and Atlantic have already been allotted. China is the frontrunner, with a number of contracts and a determination to be the first country to extract large quantities. Russia is also heavily involved, as is Britain, though mainly as a sponsor for American firms, some with colourful histories. One of those companies, the defence giant Lockheed Martin, was associated with a marine mining effort back in the 1970s; it later transpired that this project was a front for a CIA attempt to pull a sunken USSR submarine off the seafloor.</p><p>The ISA's defining goal is that we will all, one way or another, benefit from the exploitation of this new frontier. When extraction finally begins each country will have to share its royalties with every other country in the world, so honouring that \"common heritage of mankind\" clause. But environmentalists worry that the windfalls will not compensate for the cost and ecological impact. They argue that the sea floor is one of the planet's most pristine, biodiverse habitats; that species could be destroyed before they are fully understood. Indeed, the majority of creatures on the seabed are so varied and unfamiliar that they have not been named yet, let alone studied in detail.</p><p>They represent an ecosystem we are still barely beginning to understand. Until a few decades ago scientists had assumed that all life on Earth was directly or indirectly reliant on oxygen or the sun. They thought the seabed was effectively barren. They could hardly have been more wrong. We now know there are countless creatures living on the bottom of the sea, many of them reliant on chemical energy rather than light: chemosynthesis as opposed to photosynthesis. There are eerie specimens such as the so-called faceless fish discovered last year in seas 13,000 feet deep off Australia's coast. There are snails, crabs and urchins, alien-looking shrimps, sponges and giant tube worms without mouths or digestive tracts. It might well be possible to extract minerals from some areas without causing too much disturbance. But until more environmental tests are done, we simply won't know.</p><p>The ISA's argument is that opening up the seabed to mining will only improve our understanding of this realm. Some suspect the institution is being naive. They worry not merely about miners crushing creatures in the gears of their machines but about the plumes of dust and sand thrown up by the mining process. Some simulations have suggested the debris could be carried hundreds of miles, effectively polluting undisturbed habitats elsewhere on the seafloor. Fishing groups worry about toxins being consumed by fish and entering the food chain. Then again, early studies by the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton suggest the plumes could be far smaller and less damaging than environmentalists fear.</p><p>All the same, there is genuine concern about what could be lost if we unwittingly pollute the seabed. Researchers are using an ever-increasing number of compounds from sea flora and fauna as ingredients for new medicines. They suggest that the cure for cancer, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease could be destroyed before we find it. Some even worry that transferring organisms up from the deep, where they have had no contact with mankind since the dawn of time, could risk the release of dangerous compounds or viruses that could cause pandemics.</p><p>Others question whether the ISA is equipped to manage the process. While terrestrial mining regulators tend to have hundreds of employees conducting spot checks on the sites they oversee, the ISA does not own a helicopter or a boat. Indeed, when I visited the place recently, the offices looked half-empty. The secretary-general, a British lawyer called Michael Lodge, insisted that the institution was extremely rigorous with its decisions about who to award exploration licences to. I asked whether the ISA had ever rejected a licence application. Not yet, he said.</p><p>Earlier this month the ISA held a seminal meeting to begin working out the rules for deep-sea mining. As is the tradition, many of the crucial meetings were held in private, their recommendations rubber-stamped by the membership. When no one is paying you much attention (few politicians, let alone members of the public, have heard of the ISA) there is not much incentive to be all that transparent.</p><p>Which explains why it has taken until now for one of the ISA's most controversial decisions to be reported. A few months ago, the ISA designated a 10,000 sq km section of the mid-Atlantic ridge to Poland for mining exploration. On the face of it there is nothing untoward about this: France and Russia have analogous rights to patches of the ridge. But Poland's zone is a little different: it contains that precious patch of carbonate towers scientists called the Lost City.</p><p>The fact that one of the world's most important sites of scientific interest, a place which might hold the secrets to the origins of life on this planet and on other planets, is part of a mining exploration site is shocking. Ocean geologists and biologists, including the team that discovered the place, have sent letters to the ISA expressing their concern. They have received no <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reply.No\">www.reply.No</url> one is suggesting that Poland is about to tear down the Lost City; for one thing, there are no precious metals in those tall, white towers. However, with the ISA yet to devise the rules, there is no legal sanction. They could tear them down, destroying the only clues we have of how life began, and there would be nothing that anyone could do about it. So why isn't everyone making more fuss about this? The first answer is that few people are yet aware of the imminence of deep-sea mining. Second, we are caught on the horns of a dilemma. If we want electric cars we will need cobalt from the seabed. If we want solar panels we will need tellurium.</p><p>In much the same way as the quest for oil defined the physical economy - and much of the statecraft - of the 20th century, the quest for minerals to power an electric future is likely to define the 21st, taking us into deeply uncomfortable territory.</p><p>Ed Conway's documentary on the ocean economy, In Too Deep, is available on demand on Sky and YouTube How to mine the seabed 1.

The retail juggernaut was days from announcing its $13.8 billion purchase of Whole Foods, a deal that would not only roil the grocery industry but also trigger a government antitrust investigation into the strategies and practices of the \"Everything Store.\" And, as Zapolsky was no doubt aware, no organization had been more dogged in raising those concerns than New America - and, in particular, a 28-year-old law student named Lina Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this year, the Yale Law Journal published a 24,000-word \"note\" by Khan titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\" The article laid out with remarkable clarity and sophistication why American antitrust law has evolved to the point that it is no longer equipped to deal with tech giants such as Amazon.com, which has made itself as essential to commerce in the 21st century as the railroads, telephone systems and computer hardware makers were in the 20th.</p><p>It's not just Amazon, however, that animates concerns about competition and market power, and Khan is not the only one who is worrying. The same issues lie behind the European Union's recent $2.7 billion fine against Google for favoring its own services in the search results it presents to its users. They are also at the heart of the long-running battle in the telecom industry over net neutrality and the ability of cable companies and Internet service providers to give favorable treatment to their own content. They are implicated in complaints that Facebook has aided the rise of \"fake news\" while draining readers and revenue from legitimate news media. They even emerge in debates over the corrupting role of corporate money in politics, the decline in entrepreneurship, the slowdown in corporate investment and the rise of income inequality.</p><p>And just last week, Democrats cited stepped-up antitrust enforcement as a centerpiece of their plan to deliver \"a better deal\" for Americans should they regain control of Congress and the White House.</p><p>For Amazon, which prides itself on its relentless consumer focus, the suggestion that its spectacular growth might not be in the public interest poses a particular challenge. Since it was published, Khan's \"note\" has drawn more than 50,000 readers online - an extraordinary reach for a law review article. Her work has been cited by the Economist, the Financial Times, Forbes, Wired, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and she has appeared on major broadcast media. Last spring, she was invited to join some of the most prominent academics in antitrust law to speak at an economic conference at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Khan is amazed and a bit amused by all the attention. Born in London, where her Pakistani parents met as college students, she grew up in a well-to-do New York City suburb before heading off to Williams College, where she was editor of the school newspaper. Looking toward a future in journalism, she moved to Washington and soon found herself working as a researcher at New America on issues relating to economic power.</p><p>Thinking a law degree would allow her to be a more effective advocate, she headed off to Yale Law, where she impressed instructors with her keen mind, thorough preparation and passion for economic justice. In her second year, she began researching the history of antitrust law to understand why it has failed to provide much of a check on corporate power. \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" was the result.</p><p>\"I was blown away by what she produced,\" said David Grewal, a professor who advised Khan on her project. \"It didn't read like a student note. It was equal to the best legal scholarship, combining scholarly elegance with an activist agenda and enormous attention to detail.</p><p>\"Most of my colleagues would give their little finger for a piece that got that much attention,\" Grewal said, only half joking.</p><p>Next year, after the bar exam and a wedding, Khan will return to Yale for a postgraduate year before heading off for a clerkship with Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California, a \"feeder judge\" to clerkships on the Supreme Court.</p><p>          'The Antitrust Paradox'          </p><p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of Robert Bork's \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a book that even its critics acknowledge changed the direction of antitrust law.</p><p>Although a longtime law professor at Yale, Bork was a charter member of the \"Chicago school\" of law and economics, which argued that judges should use rigorous analysis of economic consequences in deciding antitrust cases. Previously, much of antitrust doctrine was based on somewhat vague political notions that big was bad - that large corporations with large market shares inevitably used their power to drive rivals from the market, raise prices, buy favorable treatment from legislators and regulators. In 1963, the Supreme Court even went so far as to declare that any merger that achieved more than 30 percent share of any market should be considered unlawful.</p><p>Relying on economic theories that competition - or the threat of it - could be counted on to discipline dominant firms, Bork argued that rather than helping consumers, most antitrust enforcement was likely to do the opposite, stifling innovation and preventing companies from realizing efficiencies of scale and scope that could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, more choice and greater convenience.</p><p>Chicago school economics was a marriage of the latest in economic modeling and free market ideology. In considering whether a proposed merger or business practice would harm competition, courts and regulators narrowed their analysis to ask whether it would hurt consumers by raising prices. And since Chicago theory pretty much assumed away the ability of even a dominant firm to raise prices, the answer was almost always no.</p><p>And so began a 30-year stretch in which the government blocked relatively few mergers and prosecuted almost no companies for monopolizing competition.</p><p>\"The Chicago school runs deep, and the courts still partake of the Borkian Kool-Aid,\" said Steven Salop, an antitrust expert at the Georgetown University Law Center who has long argued that antitrust enforcement is too permissive.</p><p>At the Chicago conference this spring, Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who, with Bork, is considered a pioneer of Chicago antitrust analysis, asked mischievously, \"Antitrust is dead, isn't it?\"</p><p>There is little debate that this cramped view of antitrust law has resulted in an economy where two-thirds of all industries are more concentrated than they were 20 years ago, according to a study by President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and many are dominated by three or four firms. What's now at issue is whether the outcome has benefited society.</p><p>Research by John Kwoka of Northeastern University, for example, has found that three-quarters of mergers have resulted in price increases without any offsetting benefits. Kwoka cited industries such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, cable television and eyeglasses.</p><p>And even former antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of Google's purchase of YouTube and ITA Software and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp look naive in hindsight, eliminating the kinds of companies that might have someday challenged the tech sector's most dominant firms.</p><p>\"The current market is not always a good indication of competitive harm,\" said Khan in laying out for me her critique of the way the government goes about analyzing proposed mergers. \"They have to ask what the future market will look like.\"</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, complain that antitrust analysis has failed to fully incorporate the insights of modern game theory, information theory and behavioral economics that go a long way to explaining why consumers, companies and markets don't behave the way Chicago school theory says they should.</p><p>As Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has demonstrated, Chicago antitrust theory is ill equipped to deal with high-tech industries, which naturally tend toward winner-take-all competition. In these, most of the expenses are in the form of upfront investments, such as software (think Apple and Microsoft), meaning that the cost of serving additional customers is close to zero. Customers naturally gravitate to the platform with the largest network of customers (think Facebook). Or their success depends on having the most customer data (think Google).</p><p>They also often have two sets of customers who need each other, such as credit card companies that serve merchants and cardholders, or Internet service providers that link content producers with content consumers.</p><p>What this \"post-Chicago\" economics shows is that in such industries, firms that jump into an early lead can gain such an overwhelming advantage that new rivals find it nearly impossible to enter the market, while even experienced ones find it difficult to stay in the game.</p><p>To varying degrees, Amazon displays all these characteristics, and by its breadth and complexity, confounds traditional antitrust analysis. What began as an online book retailer now sells just about everything- not just online but, more recently, also through physical stores and pickup depots. In hundreds of high-volume categories, Amazon is not only a retailer but also produces its own branded line of merchandise.</p><p>Through its online marketplace, customers can buy from Amazon but also from millions of competing retailers who typically pay a 15 percent to 20 percent commission and now account for half of all unit sales on the Amazon platform - and a quarter of Amazon's total profits. Many of these \"third-party sellers\" pay additional fees to store their inventory in Amazon warehouses, use Amazon robots and personnel to fulfill customer orders, or rely on Amazon to deliver their goods to customers across the globe through its fleet of 25 planes and 4,000 trucks or its deeply discounted delivery contracts with UPS and FedEx.</p><p>This remarkable business machine, offering 350 million items for sale, is fast approaching the point where it can claim nearly every household in America as a customer. And through its $99-a-year Prime program, Amazon uses free delivery and access to its premium video service to bolster loyalty of customers who each spend an average of $1,500 per year. (The experience of my own household surely attests to this.) By one estimate, at current growth rates, half of all American households will be Prime customers by 2020.</p><p>This description of Amazon's business is drawn largely from its public filings and reports from market analysts. As is its custom, Amazon declined to comment or answer questions for the record. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, is the owner of The Washington Post.</p><p>\"Amazon has brought us to a new and better place,\" Khan said. \"So did the early railroads and steel company giants. But I don't think Amazon is the problem - the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon illustrates that in a powerful way.\"</p><p>          Amazon's business boom          </p><p>Is Amazon so successful, is it getting so big, that it poses a threat to consumers or competition? By current antitrust standards, certainly not.</p><p>Here is a company, after all, known for disrupting and turbocharging competition in every market it enters, lowering prices and forcing rivals to match the relentless efficiency of its operations and the quality of its service. That is, after all, usually how firms come to dominate an industry, and there is nothing illegal about that. But under the antitrust law, once a firm is dominant, its actions and business practices become subject to more rigorous scrutiny, to make sure it is not abusing its dominant position. And like all dominant firms, Amazon disputes its dominance.</p><p>Much is made of the fact that more than half - 55 percent - of Americans begin their online shopping trips on Amazon. But as Amazon is quick to point out, online sales still account for less than 10 percent of all retail sales, which is the more relevant figure as the line between online and bricks-and-mortar disappears. By that standard, Walmart is still nearly four times Amazon's size.</p><p>Retailing, however, is a sector, not a product market, the usual frame of reference for antitrust analysis. And other than books, Amazon's original market where it maintains a commanding 40 percent market share, Amazon doesn't have anything close to monopoly-like market shares.</p><p>In clothing, for example, where it has made a big push, Amazon accounts for 20 percent of online sales but less than 7 percent overall. Amazon will soon dethrone Best Buy as the largest seller of consumer electronics, but even there, its overall share will be only 20 percent. Amazon's purchase of the parent of Diapers.com has helped give it a 43 percent share of the online baby products market, but that translates into less than 20 percent of sales in that category.</p><p>Even with the Whole Foods purchase, Amazon will have only a 2 percent share of the $600 billion-a-year American grocery market, well below the more than 20 percent market share for Walmart and 7 percent for Kroger. That is why most antitrust experts think there is little chance that the government will try to block the deal.</p><p>But in her article, Khan argues that these metrics do not capture the \"architecture\" of Amazon's emerging market power.</p><p>If Amazon is so small and its growth so benign, she asks, then why does the prospect of Amazon's entry into a market dramatically drive up its own stock price while driving down those of its rivals?</p><p>Why, she asks, have so many large and successful bricks-and-mortar retailers been unable to make significant inroads into online retailing while so many small retailers feel they have no choice but to use Amazon's platform to reach customers?</p><p>Antitrust analysis generally assumes dominant firms often exercise their market power by raising prices, but what if Amazon exercises its market power, Khan asks, by squeezing the profit margins of its suppliers? What if its strategy is to keep prices low in markets it dominates to gain entry into new markets that will generate still more sales and profits?</p><p>How, she asks, can antitrust regulators analyze the structure of a market, and Amazon's bargaining power in it, when so many of Amazon's competitors are also its customers or suppliers? Why did Sears stock rise 19 percent on the day that it announced its Kenmore line of appliances would be sold through Amazon? Why do Walmart, Google, Oracle and UPS all consider Amazon their biggest threat?</p><p>And if Amazon is not a monopolist, Khan asks, why are financial markets pricing its stock as if it is going to be?</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers should be . . . concerned about the fact that Amazon increasingly controls the infrastructure of online commerce and the ways it is harnessing this dominance to expand and advantage its new business ventures,\" Khan wrote in her law review article.</p><p>As Khan sees it, Amazon's strategy and business practices are \"neither anticipated nor understood by current antitrust doctrines,\" and the language and tools by which regulators and judges now analyze the company's business practices \"totally miss the game.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference between behavior designed to increase market share and behavior to drive out competitors?\" Khan asks. \"The problem is they look a lot alike.\"</p><p>          Antitrust's old guard          </p><p>It probably won't surprise you to learn that most antitrust practitioners reject accusations from a third-year law student that the legal precedents and analytical tools they have developed and mastered over the years are inadequate to the task of protecting us from the predations of Big Tech.</p><p>\"Lame argument,\" huffs Timothy Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who, as chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, helped bring the monopolization case against Microsoft.</p><p>\"I don't lie awake at night worrying that there are so few creative people in this country that one company might turn out to be the best at everything,\" said a former head of the antitrust division.</p><p>A former member of the Federal Trade Commission put it this way: \"The antitrust law I believe in is that we want to give as much latitude as possible to innovate and deliver better products at lower prices, and only stop them when we see some evidence of conduct that excludes others from competing.\"</p><p>They also scorn Khan's suggestion that the consumer welfare standard that underlies most antitrust analysis should be broadened to a public interest standard that takes into account the impact of dominant firms on workers, communities and the political process. As they see it, such vague and subjective standards would invite political and ideological mischief.</p><p>But if you push, most of these old hands will acknowledge that the law has not fully come to grips with the competitive dynamic in the era of online platforms and networks.</p><p>\"I think there is a fair bit of flexibility in the law to allow us to adjust and adapt to modern markets and technologies,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>Moss cited recent cases that looked beyond consumer prices to take in issues such as innovation, bargaining power and arrangements that lock consumers into existing products. The real problem, she said, is in getting more judges and enforcement agency officials to pay attention.</p><p>Indeed without the focus on prices, judges would be forced to make more subjective judgments about the intent behind a company's action or speculate about whether new companies would, or could, enter a market in the future. While judges are reluctant to wade into such murky waters, particularly in markets where the technology and business strategies are rapidly evolving, it is precisely in those industries that a more holistic approach is required.</p><p>Lurking in the background of the current debate is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. v Microsoft</emphasis>, the biggest antimonopoly case to come along in a generation. While the Chicago school's adherents view the Clinton-era prosecution as a flagrant overreach against a successful innovator, defenders cite it as proof that current law has been successful in dealing with high-tech monopolists. And if the ruling had been fully upheld, that might be the proper conclusion.</p><p>But, in fact, a federal appeals court subsequently narrowed that ruling and rejected the trial judge's order that the company should be broken up, as John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust had been nearly a century before. In the end, the case was settled by the Bush administration on terms considered largely favorable to Microsoft.</p><p>The ambiguous legacy of the Microsoft case - and the relative weakness of American antitrust law - was highlighted last month when the European Union imposed a record fine on Google for using its virtual monopoly in search to favor its own comparative shopping sites. The Federal Trade Commission had looked at the same issue several years before and closed its investigation without taking serious action. One reason: It was not clear that, even if Google is favoring its own site (which it denies), such practices are illegal.</p><p>That wasn't always the case. Back in the pre-Chicago days when big was bad, the Supreme Court had ruled that Eastman Kodak could not leverage its monopoly in the film market to gain advantage in the market for film developing. But in more recent cases, the Supreme Court and two appeals courts, relying on Chicago law and economics, raised the bar, declaring that there must be a \"dangerous probability\" of obtaining a second monopoly for a dominant firm's behavior to be illegal.</p><p>Some observers point to the E.U.'s Google case as an example of the difference between the American and European approach: They protect competitors; we protect consumers. This often-used distinction betrays a cultural smugness on the part of Americans, one based on the view that our approach fosters the kind of creative destruction that results in great leaps of technological, managerial or financial innovation, while theirs allows second-rate rivals to accomplish through politics what they could not accomplish in the marketplace.</p><p>To me, this view betrays a naive belief that in our open market system, every person and every company has the same opportunity to succeed. Although government cannot and should not try to neutralize all the ways in which success breeds more success, neither should we assume that success in the marketplace is solely due to hard work, ingenuity and superior execution. Leveling the playing field is a legitimate policy goal. A good economic system is not only efficient but also conforms to common intuitions of fair play.</p><p>The logic and intent behind America's century-old antitrust laws is that even innovation- and productivity-inducing competition needs to be managed to ensure a healthy ecosystem in which a relatively few corporate giants don't use the economic advantages they have won to tilt the playing field even further in their favor.</p><p>\"I think we have to go back to the original spirit of the antitrust laws,\" said Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school known for his skepticism about government regulation. \"A narrow, purely economic approach has been unable to capture the concerns people have about the concentration of economic and political power.\"</p><p>          When to step in          </p><p>While Amazon is not yet a threat to competition, it is well on its way to becoming one, which is probably why the company is taking these arguments more seriously. Amazon is reported to be in the market for an antitrust economist, and in the wake of the Whole Foods announcement, it has engaged the services of two former heads of the Justice Department antitrust division, one Democrat and one Republican.</p><p>I can't tell you exactly at what point the government should step in to block Amazon from buying another company or curtail some of its practices. I am, however, fairly confident in saying it ought to be well before Amazon achieves a 40 percent market share in books, groceries, clothing, hardware, electronics and home furnishings. And it ought to be before Amazon pulls even with UPS in shipping, Oracle in computing and Comcast in media content. Khan's reasonable insight is that if we don't yet have the tools to identify when companies have reached that competitive tipping point, then someone ought to invent them.</p><p>And as for those \"bad old days\" when officials still had the courage to call a monopolist a monopolist, let's remember it was the government's aborted prosecution of IBM, the most innovative and respected company of its day, that made Microsoft possible; the prosecution of Microsoft that made Google possible; and the breakup of AT&amp;T that made Apple and wireless telephony possible.</p><p>\"Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and every day they deliver enormously valuable products,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in a speech last month at New America. \"But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors.\"</p><p>There is nothing in economic theory that makes it inevitable that successful disrupters will be disrupted. Indeed, what history demonstrates - and what a 28-year-old law student reminds us - is that it sometimes takes a little public power to keep private power in check.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pearlstein@washpost.com\">pearlstein@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ff38b9ca722e11e79eacd56bd5568db8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P4R-44B1-DYX1-H4S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3934\"/><timeReceived>12:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 30, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The retail juggernaut was days from announcing its $13.8 billion purchase of Whole Foods, a deal that would not only roil the grocery industry but also trigger a government antitrust investigation into the strategies and practices of the \"Everything Store.\" And, as Zapolsky was no doubt aware, no organization had been more dogged in raising those concerns than New America - and, in particular, a 28-year-old law student named Lina Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this year, the Yale Law Journal published a 24,000-word \"note\" by Khan titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\" The article laid out with remarkable clarity and sophistication why American antitrust law has evolved to the point that it is no longer equipped to deal with tech giants such as Amazon.com, which has made itself as essential to commerce in the 21st century as the railroads, telephone systems and computer hardware makers were in the 20th.</p><p>It's not just Amazon, however, that animates concerns about competition and market power, and Khan is not the only one who is worrying. The same issues lie behind the European Union's recent $2.7 billion fine against Google for favoring its own services in the search results it presents to its users. They are also at the heart of the long-running battle in the telecom industry over net neutrality and the ability of cable companies and Internet service providers to give favorable treatment to their own content. They are implicated in complaints that Facebook has aided the rise of \"fake news\" while draining readers and revenue from legitimate news media. They even emerge in debates over the corrupting role of corporate money in politics, the decline in entrepreneurship, the slowdown in corporate investment and the rise of income inequality.</p><p>And just last week, Democrats cited stepped-up antitrust enforcement as a centerpiece of their plan to deliver \"a better deal\" for Americans should they regain control of Congress and the White House.</p><p>For Amazon, which prides itself on its relentless consumer focus, the suggestion that its spectacular growth might not be in the public interest poses a particular challenge. Since it was published, Khan's \"note\" has drawn more than 50,000 readers online - an extraordinary reach for a law review article. Her work has been cited by the Economist, the Financial Times, Forbes, Wired, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and she has appeared on major broadcast media. Last spring, she was invited to join some of the most prominent academics in antitrust law to speak at an economic conference at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Khan is amazed and a bit amused by all the attention. Born in London, where her Pakistani parents met as college students, she grew up in a well-to-do New York City suburb before heading off to Williams College, where she was editor of the school newspaper. Looking toward a future in journalism, she moved to Washington and soon found herself working as a researcher at New America on issues relating to economic power.</p><p>Thinking a law degree would allow her to be a more effective advocate, she headed off to Yale Law, where she impressed instructors with her keen mind, thorough preparation and passion for economic justice. In her second year, she began researching the history of antitrust law to understand why it has failed to provide much of a check on corporate power. \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" was the result.</p><p>\"I was blown away by what she produced,\" said David Grewal, a professor who advised Khan on her project. \"It didn't read like a student note. It was equal to the best legal scholarship, combining scholarly elegance with an activist agenda and enormous attention to detail.</p><p>\"Most of my colleagues would give their little finger for a piece that got that much attention,\" Grewal said, only half joking.</p><p>Next year, after the bar exam and a wedding, Khan will return to Yale for a postgraduate year before heading off for a clerkship with Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California, a \"feeder judge\" to clerkships on the Supreme Court.</p><h>'The Antitrust Paradox'</h><p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of Robert Bork's \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a book that even its critics acknowledge changed the direction of antitrust law.</p><p>Although a longtime law professor at Yale, Bork was a charter member of the \"Chicago school\" of law and economics, which argued that judges should use rigorous analysis of economic consequences in deciding antitrust cases. Previously, much of antitrust doctrine was based on somewhat vague political notions that big was bad - that large corporations with large market shares inevitably used their power to drive rivals from the market, raise prices, buy favorable treatment from legislators and regulators. In 1963, the Supreme Court even went so far as to declare that any merger that achieved more than 30 percent share of any market should be considered unlawful.</p><p>Relying on economic theories that competition - or the threat of it - could be counted on to discipline dominant firms, Bork argued that rather than helping consumers, most antitrust enforcement was likely to do the opposite, stifling innovation and preventing companies from realizing efficiencies of scale and scope that could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, more choice and greater convenience.</p><p>Chicago school economics was a marriage of the latest in economic modeling and free market ideology. In considering whether a proposed merger or business practice would harm competition, courts and regulators narrowed their analysis to ask whether it would hurt consumers by raising prices. And since Chicago theory pretty much assumed away the ability of even a dominant firm to raise prices, the answer was almost always no.</p><p>And so began a 30-year stretch in which the government blocked relatively few mergers and prosecuted almost no companies for monopolizing competition.</p><p>\"The Chicago school runs deep, and the courts still partake of the Borkian Kool-Aid,\" said Steven Salop, an antitrust expert at the Georgetown University Law Center who has long argued that antitrust enforcement is too permissive.</p><p>At the Chicago conference this spring, Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who, with Bork, is considered a pioneer of Chicago antitrust analysis, asked mischievously, \"Antitrust is dead, isn't it?\"</p><p>There is little debate that this cramped view of antitrust law has resulted in an economy where two-thirds of all industries are more concentrated than they were 20 years ago, according to a study by President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and many are dominated by three or four firms. What's now at issue is whether the outcome has benefited society.</p><p>Research by John Kwoka of Northeastern University, for example, has found that three-quarters of mergers have resulted in price increases without any offsetting benefits. Kwoka cited industries such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, cable television and eyeglasses.</p><p>And even former antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of Google's purchase of YouTube and ITA Software and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp look naive in hindsight, eliminating the kinds of companies that might have someday challenged the tech sector's most dominant firms.</p><p>\"The current market is not always a good indication of competitive harm,\" said Khan in laying out for me her critique of the way the government goes about analyzing proposed mergers. \"They have to ask what the future market will look like.\"</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, complain that antitrust analysis has failed to fully incorporate the insights of modern game theory, information theory and behavioral economics that go a long way to explaining why consumers, companies and markets don't behave the way Chicago school theory says they should.</p><p>As Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole has demonstrated, Chicago antitrust theory is ill equipped to deal with high-tech industries, which naturally tend toward winner-take-all competition. In these, most of the expenses are in the form of upfront investments, such as software (think Apple and Microsoft), meaning that the cost of serving additional customers is close to zero. Customers naturally gravitate to the platform with the largest network of customers (think Facebook). Or their success depends on having the most customer data (think Google).</p><p>They also often have two sets of customers who need each other, such as credit card companies that serve merchants and cardholders, or Internet service providers that link content producers with content consumers.</p><p>What this \"post-Chicago\" economics shows is that in such industries, firms that jump into an early lead can gain such an overwhelming advantage that new rivals find it nearly impossible to enter the market, while even experienced ones find it difficult to stay in the game.</p><p>To varying degrees, Amazon displays all these characteristics, and by its breadth and complexity, confounds traditional antitrust analysis. What began as an online book retailer now sells just about everything- not just online but, more recently, also through physical stores and pickup depots. In hundreds of high-volume categories, Amazon is not only a retailer but also produces its own branded line of merchandise.</p><p>Through its online marketplace, customers can buy from Amazon but also from millions of competing retailers who typically pay a 15 percent to 20 percent commission and now account for half of all unit sales on the Amazon platform - and a quarter of Amazon's total profits. Many of these \"third-party sellers\" pay additional fees to store their inventory in Amazon warehouses, use Amazon robots and personnel to fulfill customer orders, or rely on Amazon to deliver their goods to customers across the globe through its fleet of 25 planes and 4,000 trucks or its deeply discounted delivery contracts with UPS and FedEx.</p><p>This remarkable business machine, offering 350 million items for sale, is fast approaching the point where it can claim nearly every household in America as a customer. And through its $99-a-year Prime program, Amazon uses free delivery and access to its premium video service to bolster loyalty of customers who each spend an average of $1,500 per year. (The experience of my own household surely attests to this.) By one estimate, at current growth rates, half of all American households will be Prime customers by 2020.</p><p>This description of Amazon's business is drawn largely from its public filings and reports from market analysts. As is its custom, Amazon declined to comment or answer questions for the record. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, is the owner of The Washington Post.</p><p>\"Amazon has brought us to a new and better place,\" Khan said. \"So did the early railroads and steel company giants. But I don't think Amazon is the problem - the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon illustrates that in a powerful way.\"</p><h>Amazon's business boom</h><p>Is Amazon so successful, is it getting so big, that it poses a threat to consumers or competition? By current antitrust standards, certainly not.</p><p>Here is a company, after all, known for disrupting and turbocharging competition in every market it enters, lowering prices and forcing rivals to match the relentless efficiency of its operations and the quality of its service. That is, after all, usually how firms come to dominate an industry, and there is nothing illegal about that. But under the antitrust law, once a firm is dominant, its actions and business practices become subject to more rigorous scrutiny, to make sure it is not abusing its dominant position. And like all dominant firms, Amazon disputes its dominance.</p><p>Much is made of the fact that more than half - 55 percent - of Americans begin their online shopping trips on Amazon. But as Amazon is quick to point out, online sales still account for less than 10 percent of all retail sales, which is the more relevant figure as the line between online and bricks-and-mortar disappears. By that standard, Walmart is still nearly four times Amazon's size.</p><p>Retailing, however, is a sector, not a product market, the usual frame of reference for antitrust analysis. And other than books, Amazon's original market where it maintains a commanding 40 percent market share, Amazon doesn't have anything close to monopoly-like market shares.</p><p>In clothing, for example, where it has made a big push, Amazon accounts for 20 percent of online sales but less than 7 percent overall. Amazon will soon dethrone Best Buy as the largest seller of consumer electronics, but even there, its overall share will be only 20 percent. Amazon's purchase of the parent of Diapers.com has helped give it a 43 percent share of the online baby products market, but that translates into less than 20 percent of sales in that category.</p><p>Even with the Whole Foods purchase, Amazon will have only a 2 percent share of the $600 billion-a-year American grocery market, well below the more than 20 percent market share for Walmart and 7 percent for Kroger. That is why most antitrust experts think there is little chance that the government will try to block the deal.</p><p>But in her article, Khan argues that these metrics do not capture the \"architecture\" of Amazon's emerging market power.</p><p>If Amazon is so small and its growth so benign, she asks, then why does the prospect of Amazon's entry into a market dramatically drive up its own stock price while driving down those of its rivals?</p><p>Why, she asks, have so many large and successful bricks-and-mortar retailers been unable to make significant inroads into online retailing while so many small retailers feel they have no choice but to use Amazon's platform to reach customers?</p><p>Antitrust analysis generally assumes dominant firms often exercise their market power by raising prices, but what if Amazon exercises its market power, Khan asks, by squeezing the profit margins of its suppliers? What if its strategy is to keep prices low in markets it dominates to gain entry into new markets that will generate still more sales and profits?</p><p>How, she asks, can antitrust regulators analyze the structure of a market, and Amazon's bargaining power in it, when so many of Amazon's competitors are also its customers or suppliers? Why did Sears stock rise 19 percent on the day that it announced its Kenmore line of appliances would be sold through Amazon? Why do Walmart, Google, Oracle and UPS all consider Amazon their biggest threat?</p><p>And if Amazon is not a monopolist, Khan asks, why are financial markets pricing its stock as if it is going to be?</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers should be . . . concerned about the fact that Amazon increasingly controls the infrastructure of online commerce and the ways it is harnessing this dominance to expand and advantage its new business ventures,\" Khan wrote in her law review article.</p><p>As Khan sees it, Amazon's strategy and business practices are \"neither anticipated nor understood by current antitrust doctrines,\" and the language and tools by which regulators and judges now analyze the company's business practices \"totally miss the game.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference between behavior designed to increase market share and behavior to drive out competitors?\" Khan asks. \"The problem is they look a lot alike.\"</p><h>Antitrust's old guard</h><p>It probably won't surprise you to learn that most antitrust practitioners reject accusations from a third-year law student that the legal precedents and analytical tools they have developed and mastered over the years are inadequate to the task of protecting us from the predations of Big Tech.</p><p>\"Lame argument,\" huffs Timothy Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who, as chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division, helped bring the monopolization case against Microsoft.</p><p>\"I don't lie awake at night worrying that there are so few creative people in this country that one company might turn out to be the best at everything,\" said a former head of the antitrust division.</p><p>A former member of the Federal Trade Commission put it this way: \"The antitrust law I believe in is that we want to give as much latitude as possible to innovate and deliver better products at lower prices, and only stop them when we see some evidence of conduct that excludes others from competing.\"</p><p>They also scorn Khan's suggestion that the consumer welfare standard that underlies most antitrust analysis should be broadened to a public interest standard that takes into account the impact of dominant firms on workers, communities and the political process. As they see it, such vague and subjective standards would invite political and ideological mischief.</p><p>But if you push, most of these old hands will acknowledge that the law has not fully come to grips with the competitive dynamic in the era of online platforms and networks.</p><p>\"I think there is a fair bit of flexibility in the law to allow us to adjust and adapt to modern markets and technologies,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>Moss cited recent cases that looked beyond consumer prices to take in issues such as innovation, bargaining power and arrangements that lock consumers into existing products. The real problem, she said, is in getting more judges and enforcement agency officials to pay attention.</p><p>Indeed without the focus on prices, judges would be forced to make more subjective judgments about the intent behind a company's action or speculate about whether new companies would, or could, enter a market in the future. While judges are reluctant to wade into such murky waters, particularly in markets where the technology and business strategies are rapidly evolving, it is precisely in those industries that a more holistic approach is required.</p><p>Lurking in the background of the current debate is  U.S. v Microsoft , the biggest antimonopoly case to come along in a generation. While the Chicago school's adherents view the Clinton-era prosecution as a flagrant overreach against a successful innovator, defenders cite it as proof that current law has been successful in dealing with high-tech monopolists. And if the ruling had been fully upheld, that might be the proper conclusion.</p><p>But, in fact, a federal appeals court subsequently narrowed that ruling and rejected the trial judge's order that the company should be broken up, as John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust had been nearly a century before. In the end, the case was settled by the Bush administration on terms considered largely favorable to Microsoft.</p><p>The ambiguous legacy of the Microsoft case - and the relative weakness of American antitrust law - was highlighted last month when the European Union imposed a record fine on Google for using its virtual monopoly in search to favor its own comparative shopping sites. The Federal Trade Commission had looked at the same issue several years before and closed its investigation without taking serious action. One reason: It was not clear that, even if Google is favoring its own site (which it denies), such practices are illegal.</p><p>That wasn't always the case. Back in the pre-Chicago days when big was bad, the Supreme Court had ruled that Eastman Kodak could not leverage its monopoly in the film market to gain advantage in the market for film developing. But in more recent cases, the Supreme Court and two appeals courts, relying on Chicago law and economics, raised the bar, declaring that there must be a \"dangerous probability\" of obtaining a second monopoly for a dominant firm's behavior to be illegal.</p><p>Some observers point to the E.U.'s Google case as an example of the difference between the American and European approach: They protect competitors; we protect consumers. This often-used distinction betrays a cultural smugness on the part of Americans, one based on the view that our approach fosters the kind of creative destruction that results in great leaps of technological, managerial or financial innovation, while theirs allows second-rate rivals to accomplish through politics what they could not accomplish in the marketplace.</p><p>To me, this view betrays a naive belief that in our open market system, every person and every company has the same opportunity to succeed. Although government cannot and should not try to neutralize all the ways in which success breeds more success, neither should we assume that success in the marketplace is solely due to hard work, ingenuity and superior execution. Leveling the playing field is a legitimate policy goal. A good economic system is not only efficient but also conforms to common intuitions of fair play.</p><p>The logic and intent behind America's century-old antitrust laws is that even innovation- and productivity-inducing competition needs to be managed to ensure a healthy ecosystem in which a relatively few corporate giants don't use the economic advantages they have won to tilt the playing field even further in their favor.</p><p>\"I think we have to go back to the original spirit of the antitrust laws,\" said Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school known for his skepticism about government regulation. \"A narrow, purely economic approach has been unable to capture the concerns people have about the concentration of economic and political power.\"</p><h>When to step in</h><p>While Amazon is not yet a threat to competition, it is well on its way to becoming one, which is probably why the company is taking these arguments more seriously. Amazon is reported to be in the market for an antitrust economist, and in the wake of the Whole Foods announcement, it has engaged the services of two former heads of the Justice Department antitrust division, one Democrat and one Republican.</p><p>I can't tell you exactly at what point the government should step in to block Amazon from buying another company or curtail some of its practices. I am, however, fairly confident in saying it ought to be well before Amazon achieves a 40 percent market share in books, groceries, clothing, hardware, electronics and home furnishings. And it ought to be before Amazon pulls even with UPS in shipping, Oracle in computing and Comcast in media content. Khan's reasonable insight is that if we don't yet have the tools to identify when companies have reached that competitive tipping point, then someone ought to invent them.</p><p>And as for those \"bad old days\" when officials still had the courage to call a monopolist a monopolist, let's remember it was the government's aborted prosecution of IBM, the most innovative and respected company of its day, that made Microsoft possible; the prosecution of Microsoft that made Google possible; and the breakup of AT&amp;T that made Apple and wireless telephony possible.</p><p>\"Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and every day they deliver enormously valuable products,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in a speech last month at New America. \"But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors.\"</p><p>There is nothing in economic theory that makes it inevitable that successful disrupters will be disrupted. Indeed, what history demonstrates - and what a 28-year-old law student reminds us - is that it sometimes takes a little public power to keep private power in check.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pearlstein@washpost.com\">pearlstein@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-ff38b9ca-722e-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P4J-VV31-JBFW-C3GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 30, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This case is important because about 80 percent of smartphones sold in Europe and globally run on Android, and Google is by far the largest player in internet search. The company is also the biggest player in online advertising, with a nearly 40 percent market share last year, and it has a commanding presence in a number of other internet businesses, like video, email and maps.</p><p> The European Union had three main complaints: Google required cellphone companies that wanted to offer its Play app store or search to pre-install 11 of its apps as a bundle, whether they wanted all of them or not. The company gave the largest manufacturers money if the only search they installed was Google\u2019s. And the company prohibited manufacturers from developing phones on altered versions of Android not approved by Google if they wanted to use any of its other services. The company strongly disputed the allegation that its practices are anti-competitive, arguing that they are designed to help recoup Google\u2019s investment in Android, which it licenses free to device manufacturers. Google, which plans to appeal the decision, asserts that Android is a much more open and competitive platform than its main rival, which is used by the iPhone, in which Apple controls both the device and the software. Indeed, Android devices tend to be cheaper than iPhones because manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola and LG make competing phones.</p><p> The European case is strongest when it argues against Google\u2019s exclusionary requirements \u2014 that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Companies like Samsung also pre-install apps that compete with Google\u2019s, and users can easily download software by other developers.</p><p> But the larger problem with the union\u2019s case is that it\u2019s unlikely to shake Google\u2019s dominance. For starters, while a $5.1 billion fine is large in absolute terms, it\u2019s a relative bargain for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which had $103 billion in cash and securities warming its accounts at the end of March and had nearly $13 billion in profits last year. Even more important, billions of people around the world are already accustomed to using the company\u2019s apps and services on their Android phones and are likely to stick to them. Even new users will most likely gravitate toward Google even if the company\u2019s apps are not preinstalled because of the superiority of many of its products and because so many other people use them \u2014 the network effect.</p><p> This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google\u2019s to become so dominant or impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition.</p><p> Regrettably, that does not seem to be a top priority for the Trump administration. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, recently told The Financial Times that big tech companies\u2019 buying smaller businesses could bring \u201cgreat efficiencies.\u201d He cited the example of Google acquiring YouTube in 2006. In fact, a compelling argument could be made that the online video business would be much more competitive and innovative had officials blocked that acquisition.</p><p> Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done. It\u2019s also difficult to foresee and prevent bad outcomes. That\u2019s why it is vital that regulators use all the tools they have to encourage fair play.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNM-16D5D66913EC865D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898CFAB3BBD4A NWBKNM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW5-H351-DXVP-V20Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Gallup Independent.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This case is important because about 80 percent of smartphones sold in Europe and globally run on Android, and Google is by far the largest player in internet search. The company is also the biggest player in online advertising, with a nearly 40 percent market share last year, and it has a commanding presence in a number of other internet businesses, like video, email and maps.</p><p>The European Union had three main complaints: Google required cellphone companies that wanted to offer its Play app store or search to pre-install 11 of its apps as a bundle, whether they wanted all of them or not.</p><p>The company gave the largest manufacturers money if the only search they installed was Google's. And the company prohibited manufacturers from developing phones on altered versions of Android not approved by Google if they wanted to use any of its other services. The company strongly disputed the allegation that its practices are anti-compet-itive, arguing that they are designed to help recoup Google's investment in Android, which it licenses free to device manufacturers. Google, which plans to appeal the decision, asserts that Android is a much more open and competitive platform than its main rival, which is used by the iPhone, in which Apple controls both the device and the software. Indeed, Android devices tend to be cheaper than iPhones because manu-facturers like Samsung, Motorola and LG make competing phones.</p><p>The European case is strongest when it argues against Google's exclusionary requirements - that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Companies like Samsung also pre-install apps that compete with Google's, and users can easily download software by other developers.</p><p>But the larger problem with the union's case is that it's unlikely to shake Google's dominance. For starters, while a $5.1 billion fine is large in absolute terms, it's a relative bargain for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which had $103 billion in cash and securities warming its accounts at the end of March and had nearly $13 billion in profits last year. Even more important, billions of people around the world are already accustomed to using the company's apps and services on their Android phones and are likely to stick to them. Even new users will most likely gravitate toward Google even if the company's apps are not preinstalled because of the superiority of many of its products and because so many other people use them - the network effect.</p><p>This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google's to become so dominant or impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition.</p><p>Regrettably, that does not seem to be a top priority for the Trump administration. The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, recently told The Financial Times that big tech companies' buying smaller businesses could bring \"great efficiencies.\" He cited the example of Google acquiring YouTube in 2006. In fact, a compelling argument could be made that the online video business would be much more competitive and innovative had officials blocked that acquisition.</p><p>Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done. It's also difficult to foresee and prevent bad outcomes.

This case is important because about 80 percent of smartphones sold in Europe and globally run on Android, and Google is by far the largest player in internet search. The company is also the biggest player in online advertising, with a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/google-and-facebook-s-digital-dominance-fading-as-rivals-share-grows\">nearly 40 percent</url> market share last year, and it has a commanding presence in a number of other internet businesses, like video, email and maps. </p><p>The European Union had <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4581_en.htm\">three main complaints</url>: Google required cellphone companies that wanted to offer its Play app store or search to preinstall 11 of its apps as a bundle, whether they wanted all of them or not. The company gave the largest manufacturers money if the only search they installed was Google\u2019s. And the company prohibited manufacturers from developing phones on altered versions of Android not approved by Google if they wanted to use any of its other services. The company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/android-has-created-more-choice-not-less/\">strongly disputed</url> the allegation that its practices are anticompetitive, arguing that they are designed to help recoup Google\u2019s investment in Android, which it licenses free to device manufacturers. Google, which plans to appeal the decision, asserts that Android is a much more open and competitive platform than its main rival, which is used by the iPhone, in which Apple controls both the device and the software. Indeed, Android devices tend to be cheaper than iPhones because manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola and LG make competing phones.</p><p>The European case is strongest when it argues against Google\u2019s exclusionary requirements \u2014 that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google\u2019s and users can easily download software by other developers \u2014 something many people do. </p><p>But the larger problem with the union\u2019s case is that it\u2019s unlikely to shake Google\u2019s dominance. For starters, while a $5.1 billion fine is large in absolute terms, it\u2019s a relative bargain for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which had <url normalizedValue=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/2018Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf\">$103 billion in cash and securities</url> warming its accounts at the end of March and had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/2017Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf\">nearly $13 billion in profits</url> last year. Even more important, billions of people around the world are already accustomed to using the company\u2019s apps and services on their Android phones and are likely to stick to them. Even new users will most likely gravitate toward Google even if the company\u2019s apps are not preinstalled because of the superiority of many of its products and because so many other people use them \u2014 the so-called network effect. </p><p>This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google\u2019s to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition. </p><p>Regrettably, that does not seem to be a top priority for the Trump administration. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/staff-profile/meet-assistant-attorney-general\">Makan Delrahim</url>, recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e6e1f90-8558-11e8-a29d-73e3d454535d\">told The Financial Times</url> that big tech companies\u2019 buying smaller businesses could bring \u201cgreat efficiencies.\u201d He cited the example of Google acquiring YouTube in 2006.

India\u2019s most valuable company is in talks with domestic assemblers to make a version of its Jio phone that would run on Google\u2019s Android and cost about 4,000 rupees ($54), said the people, asking not to be identified since the plans are private. The inexpensive phones will be marketed with low-cost wireless plans from Reliance Jio, the parent company\u2019s carrier, they said.   Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani is aiming to remake the country\u2019s smartphone industry much like he did in wireless services, where his aggressive prices and simple plans quickly made him the dominant force. The billionaire is also aligning himself with the Indian government\u2019s plans to build more domestic manufacturing, a possible boost for local assemblers like Dixon Technologies India, Lava International and Karbonn Mobiles.   \u201cWe are of course trying to build our domestic companies. We have a sweet spot in entry level phones,\u201d said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular &amp; Electronic Association, during an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe world has realized that India is a great place to do business and a great place to do manufacturing also.\u201d   Representatives for Reliance declined to comment.   Reliance\u2019s target of selling 150 million to 200 million phones over two years would represent a massive boost for local factories. India assembled an estimated 165 million smartphones in the year ended March, and about an equal number of basic feature phones, according to Mohindroo\u2019s association. About a fifth of the smartphones cost less than 7,000 rupees, or about $100.   Reliance rival Bharti Airtel is also in talks with assemblers to build its own 4G device, local media has reported. The Business Standard reported earlier that Ambani was considering outsourcing phone-making.   Read more: Big Tech\u2019s India Plans Can\u2019t Seem to Bypass Asia\u2019s Richest Man   Reliance in July struck a broad alliance with Google, in which the Alphabet Inc. unit would invest $4.5 billion and cooperate on technology initiatives. The partnership is still under regulatory review so Reliance is proceeding with the mobile phone initiative on its own for now.   Ambani has drawn more than $20 billion in investments from U.S. giants like Facebook Inc. for Jio Platforms Pvt, whose subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is placing the order. It\u2019s worked with assemblers on prototypes for at least two years in secret and can bring a phone rapidly to market, though it\u2019s likely to miss the November Diwali shopping season, the people said.   If Reliance succeeds in popularizing the new gadget, it could lift the prospects for Jio Platforms, accelerating Ambani\u2019s efforts to build an empire spanning e-commerce, social media and games. Many of Jio\u2019s nearly 400 million users use no-frills second-generation devices, paying $2 monthly for voice and data -- a large potential market for the new device. It could eventually erode the market share of Chinese phonemakers such as Xiaomi.   \u201cJio has an opportunity to target more than half billion Indians who don\u2019t own a smartphone and trigger a blue ocean market opportunity,\u201d said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research. \u201cWith Reliance expected to work with Indian vendors, Chinese brands will lose out on a potential opportunity and market share.\u201d   Read more: Amazon and Ambani\u2019s Jio Are Spoiling for an Epic India Fight   Reliance\u2019s own requirements could hover around 5 million gadgets per month initially, but no single Indian company currently has that kind of capacity so the order will get split between multiple assemblers, the people said. At least two domestic smartphone makers are in discussions with the telecom giant, the people added.   Phones have become essential for accessing lite versions of apps from WhatsApp to YouTube in a country with an average GDP per capita of around $2,000. That\u2019s why basic devices costing between $100 and $250 accounted for three-quarters of sales in the second quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint.   Reliance\u2019s fourth-generation wireless gadgets -- one tier below 5G -- are aimed at the estimated 350 million users of basic or feature phones that now dominate India\u2019s industry. Speaking at an industry event a few weeks ago, Ambani said millions were \u201ctrapped in the 2G era.\u201d   \u201cTheir feature phones keep them excluded, even from the basic uses of internet at a time where both India and the rest of the world are standing at the doorsteps of 5G telephony,\u201d he said.   The pandemic is spurring people to upgrade and creating new market opportunities. For example, parents are anxious to put a device in the hands of their kids so they can keep up with online lessons. There\u2019re an estimated 250 million children between the ages of 6 and 16, according to UNICEF.   \u201cIf they\u2019re successful in getting even 10% of this base to upgrade, Jio can become one of the leading smartphone brands of 2021,\u201d Shah said.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

More recently, both sides of the aisle have taken part, from Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>opposing</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>Uber s reported efforts to acquire Grubhub to Republican Senator Ted Cruz      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>calling</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>probes of Google and Facebook  long overdue. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, with Twitter and Facebook in partisan crosshairs and a Congressional report on big tech expected to be released later in June, analysts project that the financial stakes of heightened antitrust scrutiny are significant, with vast sums at stake. In March, Morningstar predicted in a report that hefty fines and damaging regulations could lead to a 15% drop in its valuation of Google s parent company Alphabet and an 11% hit to its pricing of Facebook s shares. As of Monday s market close, those combined haircuts would amount to respective losses close to $150 billion and $70 billion off the value of the two giants  shares.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>But Google and Facebook are not alone. Amazon and Apple face other probes; Twitter has especially drawn the recent ire of Trump.  These companies are going to be spending an awful lot of time in the 202 area code,  says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, referring to the code for Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Antitrust isn t new. But the building offensive against big tech s leading firms has gained intensity in recent years as the sector s leading players have become the world s most valuable companies while maintaining high market share. Google, for example, has built a 90% market share in the online search market and a 41% global market share in online advertising, while Facebook maintains 59% of the social network market, according to Morningstar. Amazon and Apple hold dominant positions in ecommerce and mobile apps.</p><p>Such market positions have drawn the scrutiny of multiple federal and state agencies. Google has faced scrutiny from the Department of Justice, which has signalled it expects to present a case before the end of the summer; a group of states led by Texas is leading a separate probe into whether the search leader stifles competition. Facebook is being<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>investigated</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>by 47 states led by New York over its ad pricing practices; the company disclosed last year that the Federal Trade Commission is looking at potential antitrust violations from its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, a House Judiciary subcommittee is expected to conclude its year-long investigation into Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook over potential antitrust practices, with a report expected in coming weeks. As these investigations close in on making a challenge, it will take momentum building from just one for the others to follow, says Elizabeth Moeller, the head of the public policy group at Pillsbury, which represents Facebook on some legal matters.  It s the chain reaction that people should be worried about. \u00a0</p><p>The tech companies have been preparing for such a day. Each has built a formidable presence in Washington in recent years. Since 2010, the big tech firms have reportedly spent almost $500 million on lobbying the federal government, according to a<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>report</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>from the Washington Post. Facebook reportedly spent $17 million on lobbying the Hill in 2019 alone; Google spent $12 million, Amazon spent $16 million and Apple spent $10 million.</p><p>For their historical playbook, the big tech companies can turn to a peer who has faced historical, but not recent, antitrust heat: Microsoft. The Windows maker faced two decades of scrutiny from antitrust regulators from the Justice Department, 20 different U.S. states and the Federal Trade Communication over concerns it was operating monopolies in web browsers and operating systems. Microsoft ultimately complied with certain measures to come onto the right side of the antitrust laws without ever paying a financial penalty in the U.S.</p><p>Microsoft and its peers have fared worse with European regulators, who slapped Microsoft with a $1 billion fine for antitrust violations<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>in 2008</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>and have levied almost $9 billion in fines on Google for antitrust violations since 2017. (Google is      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>appealing the charges</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.) The European Union also imposed a $122 million fine against Facebook for antitrust violations over its WhatsApp acquisition      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>that same year</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.\u00a0</p><p>The big tech companies might see such fines as a cheap price to pay in 2020.  One good outcome for any of the techs would be a cosmetic settlement that has a list of things that the platforms have promised to stop doing,  says Herb Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at Wharton Business School who previously advised U.S. states in the Microsoft probe.</p><p>But analysts say the reality may be much harsher. Using the European penalties as a benchmark, Morningstar estimates that the U.S. government could impose fines on Google totalling $13 billion for previous potential violations, and fines on Facebook totaling $6 billion. Beyond those penalties, new regulations and consent orders could limit their ability to acquire more businesses, leading them to increase their research and development spend, says Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi. (Analysts say an actual breakup of the tech companies, the most extreme result of an antitrust case, is highly unlikely, but would actually likely boost their related stocks.)</p><p> Antitrust is the biggest threat they will face,  says Mogharabi.  Because we don t see them facing much competitive threat from their peers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5ed654861ec1a70006839781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6024-6GV1-JBCM-F18V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

As my wife                     is a wheelchair user we chose a house clearly advertised as wheelchair accessible and suitable for a disabled visitor. To be certain, we emailed the owner and, after receiving a reassuring reply, booked it, paying                     more than \u00a33,000.                   </p><p>                     It turned out that the property had been seriously misrepresented by HomeAway. There were steps all over it. The wheelchair could not get into the corridor to access the bedrooms unless the arms were removed and the chair manhandled. It was impossible to get it into the bathroom and the gravel outside made it impossible for my wife to move about.                    </p><p>                     The holiday was a disaster. Normally, we would have just given up and gone home, but we had been joined by friends and family, and didn't want to let them down. My wife, who is extremely stoical, found the whole thing humiliating. HomeAway denied any liability claiming it just lists properties.                     NH,                     Oxfordshire                   </p><p>HomeAway is part of the \u00a37.6bn-a-year-turnover firm Expedia and charges the owner a hefty fee - between 6% and 12% - when someone books a house listed on its website. In your case, it would have pocketed between \u00a3180 and \u00a3360, but has told you that it has no liability as it \"does not become party to any contractual relationship between the holidaymaker and the owner or property manager\". Clearly, what is advertised on the site is a big part of the decision to book and it is absurd to suggest that it has no liability.</p><p>HomeAway says it has since asked the owner to remove the disability claims on the listing, which has happened, rather making your point for you. But it has continued to deny any liability and refused a refund.</p><p>You have calculated your wife's share of the \u00a33,000 bill and are going to take HomeAway to the small claims court. We suspect the company will pay up when it gets there and we will report back. Other readers should note HomeAway's stance. The big tech firms and regulators need to be aware that consumers are getting fed up with this \"no liability\" position.</p><p>                     We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

A leading U.S. medical group now saying the deaths will be in the, quote, multiple hundreds of thousands unless the country gets its act together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But still, there is no national testing strategy and the president is spending his time promoting an unproven drug and a doctor who believes that your health is impacted by alien DNA and dream sex with demons. That is real. More on that in a moment, but that is what's happening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House task force is saying that there are signs that a surge could soon hit the, quote, yellow zone states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Utah.</p><p>Plus, the hotspot State of Texas is on the verge of surpassing New York in total cases, landing in the number three spot for total cases in the country.</p><p>And as the nation tries to control the spread, the CDC director acknowledging that more could have been done by the Trump administration sooner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: The introduction from Europe happened before we realized what was happening. And by the time we realized, Europe threatened to shut down travel to Europe, there is already probably two or three weeks of 60,000 people coming back every day from Europe and that's where the large seeding came in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEILAR: But we begin now with breaking news. Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert, who frequently refused to wear a mask while on Capitol Hill subjecting others to his germs, has now tested positive for coronavirus. Here he is just 24 hours ago during a committee hearing with the attorney general, William Barr, wearing a bandanna around his neck and frequently not at all. This picture earlier that day at another committee meeting, again, no mask.</p><p>In May, Gohmert and other House Republicans met with Trump at the White House. They were all not wearing masks. Take a listen to what he said then.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX): And I do want to advice our media friends before they write stories about how we didn't wearing masks and we didn't possibly socially distance adequately, that you saw to it that we had tests and that nobody in here has the coronavirus, unless it's somebody in the media. So the only reason we would wearing a masks is if we were trying to protect ourselves from you, in the media, and we're not scared of you. So that's why we can be here like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEILAR: They are afraid of the media. In fact, the media is tested at the White House. We should make that that very clear. And they are tested often if they are going anywhere near the president.</p><p>I want to go to CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju, who is joining us now from Capitol Hill.</p><p>So, Manu, Gohmert was, this morning, scheduled to travel with the president. Tell us what else you're learning here.</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. He did and then he had a pre-flight screening in which he tested positive for the virus and so he's not traveling along with the president in Air Force One down to Texas. But Louis Gohmert is one of those members of the House who has not been wearing a mask even when he's not social distancing with members of Congress.</p><p>I've spent a lot of time in the House gallery watching members interact during extended vote series. And he often would sit on the floor, interact with members face-to-face, sit down next to them and engage in these prolonged conversations, not wearing a mask, not social distancing.</p><p>And just a few weeks ago, late last month, I caught up with Louie Gohmert and I asked directly, why are you not wearing a mask? And he told me he's been tested. He said if I get the coronavirus, you'll never see me without a mask. That was an exact quote.</p><p>And I asked him, well, you know, the health experts say that you don't have to show symptoms to carry the virus, which is why they want you to wear a mask. He said, but I keep getting tested and I don't have it. So I'm not afraid of you, but if I get it, I'll wear a mask.</p><p>And I asked when was the last time you got tested, and he did not respond to that question. But his refusal to wear a mask on the House floor prompted a lot of alarms from Republican members in particular, aides, people who have interacted with him and also some Democrats, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler, who is frequently admonished members of his committee which Gohmert sits for not wearing a mask.</p><p>And he, Nadler, said in a tweet after the news broke, he said, when individuals refuse to take the necessary precautions, it puts everyone at risk. I regularly instructed all members to wear their masks and hope this is a lesson to by all of my colleagues.</p><p>Now, in House Committee proceedings, Brianna, it is required for members to wear a mask. If they don't, the chairman can take things in their own hands, not recognize those members.</p><p>[13:05:02]</p><p>But on the floor of the House, there are no rules to enforce not wearing a mask. That is strongly recommended by the Capitol physician. But members like Louie Gohmert have not listened to those recommendations, and as a result, some members are now concerned they may have put them at risk. Brianna?</p><p>KEILAR: It's so interesting. He said, Manu, that he wasn't afraid of you, although he didn't seem to understand that you and certainly now have reason to be afraid of him. Thank you so much, Manu Raju. I appreciate the report.</p><p>Let's turn now to the grave warning by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Dr. Ross McKinney Jr. is the AAMC's Chief Scientific Officer. And, Doctor, your organization says if there is not a course correction that deaths could be, quote, in the multiple hundreds of thousands. Tell us how you came to that figure.</p><p>DR. ROSS MCKINNEY JR., CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES: Well, it's a fairly easy figure to come to. We're at 150,000 now. We have a lot of states where the epidemic is currently out of control. And we're starting to see some of the states that were in between, the so-called yellow states, where there is a drastic, rapid upswing in infections, places like Nebraska and Iowa.</p><p>So it's really important for us to organize as a country, to try and control this infection before the number of cases goes up higher, before the number of deaths goes higher, because we're not on a good path at present.</p><p>KEILAR: No, we are not. And your association represents 400-plus teaching hospitals and health systems in more than 170 medical schools. So what are you hearing from your members about the number of deaths that they're seeing, and tell us how the crisis is impacting hospitals right now.</p><p>MCKINNEY: Well, the crisis is terrible for hospitals. What we're hearing, some of our hospitals in areas like Southern Florida, that, in fact, they're full, but their staff is getting sick. And as their staff gets sick, there's nobody there to be able to fill in. So people are having to work extraordinarily long hours. And as you get more tired, you end up taking more risk just because you make mistakes. So we are really pushing at the limits of what our health system can deliver, and some of the parts of the country where there has been a lot of disease, Arizona, Florida, Texas, Houston area. We are really hitting the limit. And as disease hits the staff, it's becoming even more of a crisis than it already was.</p><p>KEILAR: The AAMC is now calling for a reset, which includes increasing the supply of PPE and increasing testing to more than 2 million tests a day. What are you hearing from your members about why that is not happening now?</p><p>MCKINNEY: Well, our members don't know necessarily why it's not happening. They just know they don't have what they need. The academic medical laboratories need the supplies to run their PCR machines. The intensive care units need PPE. Even outpatient clinics need protective equipment so that staff can be safe. Nursing homes don't have the supplies they need.</p><p>So, essentially, everywhere is short of the critical supplies and we as a country have not attempted systematically to upgrade our production of either PPE or of the supplies that are needed by the laboratories in order to meet the demands we have for testing, the demands that we have for PPE.</p><p>KEILAR: White House task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a nationwide lockdown is not necessary at this point. You all are calling for, quote, establishing and enforcing national criteria for local stay-at-home orders and reordering protocols. Tell us what that mean and how that might differ from town to town or city to city.</p><p>MCKINNEY: Well, having common standards sort of sets expectations, provides some consistency. So, you know, in New York, where they've actually done very well, they could begin to ease off, but the standard should be the same for easing off there, or easing off in Alabama if they get it under control. Because at the moment, in Alabama, it's not, in New York, it is.</p><p>So they don't necessarily have to have the same degree of lockdown, but they should use the same criteria to try and move from one phase to the next so that we can learn what are the best standards to use, so that we don't get these continuous waves of infection that have followed our premature reopening so far.</p><p>KEILAR: All right. Dr. McKinney, thank you for takes us through that.</p><p>MCKINNEY: Thank you.</p><p>KEILAR: The president doubling down on an unproven drug and his support of a doctor who believes that your health is connected to alien DNA and dream sex with demons, and, no, I am not making it up. That is what she says.</p><p>Plus, just in, the president announces he's ending an Obama-era housing rule and does so by congratulating suburbs for no longer having low-income housing in their communities. The backlash is coming in fast. And moments from now, a historic hearing, lawmakers grill the big tech CEOs on their unprecedented power.</p><p>[13:10:04]</p><p>This is CNN's special live coverage.</p><p>KEILAR: New today, a study suggesting that statewide school closures in the U.S. during the months of March, April and May could be linked to fewer coronavirus cases in those cities. In the study, Ohio pediatric researchers noted, quote, school closure may have been associated with approximately 1.37 million fewer cases of COVID-19 over a 26-day period and more than 40,000 fewer deaths over a 16-day period.</p><p>Let's check in with my colleagues across the country for more on the day's coronavirus headlines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Rosa Flores in Miami.</p><p>[13:15:01]</p><p>The State of Florida shattering its death toll record for the second day in a row, reporting 216 deaths today. The state is also reporting more than 9,000 new coronavirus cases, this as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to test the hospital system in this state.</p><p>Today statewide, there are 54 ICUs that are at capacity. Ten of them are right here in Miami-Dade County.</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I'm Joe Johns at the White House. President Trump left here today headed for the hard-hit state of Texas. From what we know about the schedule, he's not attend any events related to the coronavirus. He is expected to attend a fundraiser and also visit an oil rig highlighting his administration's energy policies and attempts to roll back federal regulations.</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. And this morning, the Small Business Administration's inspector general is sounding the alarm over what they say may be $250 million in loans and direct payments that may have been paid to ineligible applicants as part of their economic injury disaster loan program.</p><p>This was a program that was expanded in the spring with the stimulus bill and it is a program that they argue has been taken advantage of. They say that some of these schemes were perpetuated in social media.</p><p>They have some evidence that money was transferred into foreign bank accounts, but this just goes to show how difficult it can be to get this money out the door and to protect against fraud, that the SBA's I.G. say may have occurred in the EIDL loan program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEILAR: The Trump administration just rescinded an Obama-era fair housing rule and the president is marking it with a tweet that once again stokes the culture wars.</p><p>Moments ago, he tweeted, quote, I am happy to inform all the people living their suburban lifestyle dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low-income housing built in your neighborhood. Your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down.</p><p>I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH rule. Enjoy.</p><p>CNN Political Analyst April Ryan is joining me now. She is also the White House Correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks.</p><p>So, April, first of all, just explain what the fair housing rule was intended to do and why this tweet is seen as incendiary?</p><p>APRIL RYAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It's racist. It's not just incendiary, it's racist. In the 1960s, the fair housing act was put into place. And before we came on the air, I talked to former HUD Secretary Julian Castro of the Obama administration, and he informed me that they enforced this rule, they even put more into it, to bolster the Fair Housing Act for equality's sake, for neighborhoods all across the land, not just for inner cities, for the least of these that live in the inner cities, that they have a chance at life in suburban America as well.</p><p>So what the president is doing is definitely racist. When he says things like this, it's targeting certain communities who go into suburbia. He's basically saying, we don't want you there. That is what he's saying by rescinding this act. And it goes back to history, the Fair Housing Act.</p><p>When we talk about history and civil rights, that is one of those pieces that we talk about when we talk about people like John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Acts Right, all three of those were kind of synonymous around the same time.</p><p>So this president is trying to deconstruct civil rights history as well as trying to be racist in 2020 with keeping minorities out of suburban America.</p><p>KEILAR: And I wonder, April, if you think this is -- if part of this is a, I guess, a political overture to people, or if this is something that is just very much in line with the president's own past real estate practices. When you see, for instance, going back looking at how the Trump family contacted rentals, they would put a C next to a person of color's application. And there was clearly an effort to not have people of color in their buildings.</p><p>RYAN: Well, Brianna, it was not just a C next to the people of color's application. It was a C on the application. And for what they did, the Justice Department dealt with the Trump family on this matter. So the Justice Department found what they were doing at the time wrong and illegal. Fair housing is fair housing for all, not just for white America.</p><p>And, Brianna, this president is definitely trying to rally his base. When I say, his base, white America that feels like they have been left out and they want to stay on top if they're even on top.</p><p>So this is what the president is consistent about. He's done it when he was civilian Donald Trump, working with his father, in his father's real estate business, and now as president of the United States, when he's supposed to cover all of America, not just that racist portion of white America.</p><p>[13:20:06]</p><p>KEILAR: April, thank you so much. April Ryan joining us from Baltimore, we appreciate it.</p><p>President Trump admitting that he never pressured Vladimir Putin about reports of bounties placed on U.S. troops despite speaking to the Russian president several times, multiple times since the story broke.</p><p>Plus, big tech CEOs set to be grilled by lawmakers who think that they're too powerful. That high-profile hearing getting underway in just moments.</p><p>This is CNN's special coverage.</p><p>[13:25:00]</p><p>KEILAR: Six months since the reported U.S. case of coronavirus, the president is still touting the off-label use of an anti-malarial drug as a cure for COVID. It is not. But this is what the president said last night about hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's recommendations of many other people, including doctors. Many doctors think it is extremely successful, the hydroxychloroquine., coupled with the zinc and perhaps the azithromycin. But many doctors think it's extremely good and some people don't. Some people, I think, has become very political.</p><p>I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here, right? I'm here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEILAR: He is wrong. Doctors don't believe in it, not the doctors that you would be smart in trusting your life to, anyway. We will fact- check that again for the umpteenth time and we're going to show you how the president is ignoring his own public health officials. But, first, let's take a look at these doctors that he's listening to. One in particular who he gave a personal shout-out to falsely says hydroxychloroquine is a cure for the virus, which it is not, and that same doctor also believes alien DNA is used in medical treatment.</p><p>That is what she believes, that gynecological issues are caused by sex with witches and demons in dreams, scientists are creating vaccines to prevent people from being religious, that part of the government is run by reptilians and the illuminati is planning the world through abortion and same sex marriage. And that is who the president says is an important medical voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it that she's had tremendous success with it, and it took her -- I don't know why they took her off.</p><p>She said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients and I thought her voice was an important voice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEILAR: Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pulled a video featuring that doctor and others, because their claim was so demonstrably false, they violated policies of the social media outlets. But before they could take those down, the president re-tweeted the video, so did his son, Donald Jr. And it has been viewed around a billion times.</p><p>The bogus video was so problematic that Twitter suspended Donald Jr.'s account, his access to his account for 12 hours after he shared it. Trump says his political opponents and the media are speaking out against him because they don't want him to be right.</p><p>The media, his opponents, they're not the ones standing in the way of the president's claims about hydroxychloroquine. Scientists, his scientists are. The president is contradicting his own health officials as he pushes an anti-malaria drug as the cure for coronavirus. He can't admit he's wrong about it as public health watchdogs testify that the was a black eye on the Trump administration's FDA.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. PETER LURE, PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST: This has been a disappointment. And I don't think it's because of the career officials, the FDA, who I believe are committed to scientific integrity and proper regulatory procedures in this pandemic, but I do think that people have turned out to be susceptible to political pressure.</p><p>The hydroxychloroquine is frankly an embarrassment. In the end, that turned out to be a black eye for the agency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR: And here is Dr. Fauci recently.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I go along with the FDA. The overwhelming, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEILAR: Fauci says that because study after study and trial after trial show hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients treated for coronavirus and it can be harmful. The FDA revoked its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>The World Health Organization, Novartis, the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH, the Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, they all dropped their studies of the drug because it did not work on COVID patients.</p><p>The latest prominent study out of Brazil says the same but adds the patients taking the drug experienced unusual heart rhythms more frequently than those not taking the drug.</p><p>[13:30:05]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020072909CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-X4H1-JB20-G0HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00046ND</classCode><className>U S MEDICAL GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FOOD &amp;

Focused on the meeting theme, Publishing and Public Policy, the speakers highlighted the invaluable role of publishing to culture, education, political discourse, and the economy. The meeting took place September 20, 2018 in New York and received high marks from all sectors. AAP Chair and Penguin Random House CEO Markus Dohle kicked off the meeting by welcoming the audience to the New AAP. </p><p>He noted how energized the Board has been in recent months as AAP has refined its strategies under the direction of AAPs President and CEO Maria A. Pallante, noting that the entire Board came together to discuss AAPs path and is committed to its advocacy mission. He stressed AAPs important focus on supporting laws and regulations that incentivize the publication of creative expression, professional content, and learning solutions. AAP President and CEO Maria A. Pallante was then welcomed to the stage, thanking the Board of Directors for their service as the organization underwent change, with special thanks to Dohle for serving as Chair during such an important period. Pallante light-heartedly noted that the organizations headquarters are located in Washington D.C. and that AAP is ALL CAPS, in support of the Washington Capitals 2018 Stanley Cup win. She updated the audience on AAPs work during the year, not only with Congress, but with many government agencies and on complex issues in Washington and abroad. She noted that, AAP is focused on outcomes that really incentivize publishers to invest in authors, and to produce and distribute and otherwise make available a wide diversity of creative and professional content. Pallante shared several highlights from the year, noting that AAP has been known to defend the First Amendment, protect copyright interests, promote the marketplace innovations of the industry, and remind policymakers of the tremendous value of publishing (and intellectual property, more generally) to culture, education, research, and the economy. She thanked AAPs many partners in the United States and abroad. The attentive audience contemplated the critical role publishers play in a democracy in an uplifting keynote speech about the current state of political strife by Pulitzer-prize winning author Jon Meacham. Some things he noted that have been and continue to be important to democracy are the free flow of information, economic growth, and a disposition of heart and mind that made us think bigger than just about ourselves. He acknowledged the role that publishers and the media play in providing dialogue, stating what has saved us is that idea of speaking freely, thinking freely, and becoming the best we can be. AAP gave the Distinguished Public Service Award to Rep. <person><nameText>Doug Collins (R-Ga.</nameText></person>), Vice-Chair of the Judiciary Committees IP subcommittee and Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Creative Rights Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. Speaking for the Board of Directors, Pallante noted, Congressman Collins perfectly embodies the spirit of this award because he truly understands the value of published works and the importance of the broader creative communities. The Award honors an individual who has made outstanding contributions to the public good by advancing laws or policies that respect the value, creation, and publication of original works of authorship. Collins spoke to the room about public service as well as creativity, stressing that copyright protection is important to a vibrant creative ecosystem. It all starts with a moment of creative genius, he said. If we do not come back to the idea that the creative spark is inherently valuable, then nothing you have is worth anything.

In a timely presentation about competition and consumer protection, Benjamin Marks of Weil Gotshal and Manges addressed key questions in the era of big tech. In June, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced hearings and invited public comment on whether its competition and consumer protection priorities and policies should be adjusted because of change to the countrys economy, evolving business practices, new technologies, or international developments. Some questions regulators are considering, among others, include whether the unique nature of digital platforms should afford them special treatment, as well as the impact data collection (for companies like Amazon) has on competition. The hearings are already underway, with several more to be held into 2019 on 11 topics outlined by the FTC in its initial Request for Public Comments. Marks also noted that in a time when its common to hear cries of fake news, publishers can play an important role in the delivery of credible information. The program concluded with AAP awarding London-based publisher Azadeh Parsapour from Nogaame-publishing the International Freedom to Publish I Jeri Laber Award. Parsapour uses crowdfunding to publish eBooks for Iranian authors that would likely be censored or banned in her native country. In prepared remarks from London, she accepted the award and dedicated it to unnamed Iranian authors, editors, and publishers who carry on working and creating literature and knowledge despite obstacles and suppression. Given annually, the award recognizes a book publisher outside the United States who has demonstrated courage and fortitude in defending freedom of expression. In bestowing this award, AAP has long been guided by the principle that if one of publisher is denied the right to publish, that threat affects us all. This years award was presented by Geoff Shandler, Chair of the AAP International Freedom to Publish Committee and Editorial Director and Vice-President at Custom House (HarperCollins), who recognized Paraspours entrepreneurial genius and commitment, not only to publishing silenced voices through Nogaam, but also in helping to start the Tehran Book Fair.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122414751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC7-F7X1-DYTH-G1K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It follows that it's critically important to do 'contact-tracing', that is, to understand who interacted with a person who has tested positive. The question is, how do you do it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early days of the epidemic, detailed flow-maps of a person's movements were created. For instance, there was a super spreader in Kasaragod, Kerala. Researchers retraced his travels, and many whom he encountered were tested; dozens of cases were found. But there were allegations that the man wasn't totally truthful about all his movements, as he may have been involved in gold smuggling. So interviews aren't necessarily foolproof, and they're tedious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At that time, there were only about 10 cases in all of India. It was possible to do the elaborate manual contact tracing. But when you have 50,000 cases, it becomes much harder to do this. Nevertheless, there was an ad in the US (1.36 million cases as of May 11th) for a 13-month temporary position in the federal government at an annual salary of $52,000 to $63,000.</p><p>This can also be a business opportunity for smart services entrepreneurs in India looking for short-term opportunities. Those who jumped into medical transcription, call centres, data labelling and content moderation jobs can make a quick buck by marshalling hundreds or thousands of Indians at Rs 15,000 a month to support this tedious activity.</p><p>But there is no question that automated tools will be invaluable, if not inevitable, in contact-tracing as they can scale up, they don't get tired and they don't make mistakes. The best-performing countries, like South Korea and Singapore, created elaborate automated contract-tracing tools, which are credited with keeping their infection levels low (along with mass testing).</p><p>The Government of India has developed its own contact-tracing app, Aarogya Setu. It works on Bluetooth on your Android or iOS phone to let you know about your risk profile.</p><p>At the moment, the information it provides is a little sketchy. After asking you a few generic questions, it tells you whether you are 'safe' or not, based on your answers about age, travel history, co-morbidities, your self-assessment of symptoms, etcetera.</p><p>On an ongoing basis, it tells you how many people in your vicinity are virus-positive. For instance, in my case, it tells me that within one kilometre, there are 1,500 users, 60 have taken the self-assessment tests, one user is 'unwell', no coronavirus positives; and that's about it.</p><p>Ideally, I'd like the app to warn me with a notification as soon as I come within two meters of any coronavirus-positive person; also, when I go to the vegetable store, I'd like to know if there have been any positives there in the last one hour or so. These should enable me to take appropriate action: maybe, I'll go to a different store.</p><p>But for such an app to be effective, there has to be mass adoption. Almost everybody around (at the very least, 60 per cent) must be using it for it to have real value. As of now, the Government is merely beseeching everyone to download this app on their smartphones. However, it has now become a requirement for Government employees.</p><p>It is possible that down the road it will become mandatory: it has a place-holder for an e-pass that allows us to travel, take public transport, attend certain events, and so on. Some may view this as coercive, but on the other hand, an e-pass will make the job of law enforcement much simpler: you just have to show them your (I imagine green) e-pass on the app, and they can wave you through. No need for complicated affidavits.</p><p>Of course, this will remind some people of China's intrusive social credit system, wherein your behaviour (including whether you are doing things approved by the Chinese Communist Party) will determine whether you will be allowed to board a flight, or whether your children can go to school. It is a ruthless panopticon. In my considered opinion, Aarogya Setu is far more benign and quite appropriate in these desperate times.</p><p>There are also alternatives. Apple and Google have just jointly unveiled (a rare act of cooperation among them) a decentralised Bluetooth-based app that will strictly store the data on smartphones, without a centralised collection hub as in the case of Government apps.</p><p>The decentralised approach seems to be gaining some momentum as countries as varied as Singapore, Germany and Australia are planning to shift to it, partly because iPhone Bluetooth restrictions were hampering their centralised solutions. France and Norway are staying with their own apps. Others like Poland, Italy, Switzerland and Ireland may all go with the US giants.</p><p>At the moment, the Google-Apple API is not available, so it's hard to tell if the decentralised app direction is the right way to go. If it turns out to be, there may need to be a smooth migration to it from the Aaroyga Setu app.</p><p>In the meantime, several people, not surprisingly from the opposition Indian National Congress, are complaining about the whole idea of data collection.</p><p>There's a fair amount of politics here: after all, the Congress was implicated in the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data collection scandal. Similarly, there is an ongoing allegation against Kerala's government regarding a US firm named Sprinklr, which allegedly has gained monopoly access to virus-related health data of 175,000 individuals who answered questionnaires.</p><p>Nevertheless, the point is valid. When governments collect data about individuals, they are loath to let the data go. Ever. Yet, are we more relaxed about Big Tech collecting enormous troves of data about us?</p><p>Google and Apple, for instance, know in minute detail about your buying habits, your preferences and exactly where you went. Facebook has shown a generally cavalier attitude to the data privacy of individuals. Xiaomi, which sells a lot of smartphones in India, allegedly sends user data to China silently. There are major concerns about Huawei. Amazon knows you well. Too well, as its ads show.</p><p>Therefore, it may be hypocritical (or purely political) to accuse the Government of India of invading privacy when Indians are so casual about their data being plundered by Big Tech, or the Alibaba-owned PayTM, or the Walmart-owned Flipkart, or the TransUnion-owned CIBIL. Although, admittedly, the Government has more coercive powers. Many Indians remember the Emergency.</p><p>In general, the whole question of data privacy is a major issue in India. The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) was introduced in Parliament in December 2019, in many ways as a follow-on to Europe's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which are in effect now.</p><p>India's PDPB has been criticised on several counts. Big Tech doesn't like it because it insists that Indian data be maintained in India, which to the casual observer seems unexceptionable, but Big Tech views it as an erosion of their powers. Privacy advocates don't like it because Government agencies may be given broad powers to bypass provisions of the Bill, possibly in emergencies. However, a detailed comparison of GDPR and PDPB does not suggest broad divergence.</p><p>What is the value of privacy? Would you give up a little bit of that if it were to potentially save your life? This is a choice that the Covid-19 virus forces us to examine, as one could argue that any form of contact-tracing is intrusive. But it is also apparently the simplest and most effective form of identifying potential cases.</p><p>It's a little like we surrender some of our freedoms for the smooth running of our collective lives. We don't assert our freedom of expression to shout 'FIRE!' in a crowded theatre. We don't assert our freedom of movement when we come across a red traffic light: we stop (at least, most of us do) because otherwise there would be utter chaos on the roads.</p><p>But there are indeed troubling questions about privacy and efficacy of all automated solutions, as an editorial in Nature suggests, for instance, about accuracy and security. What, though, is the trade-off? Survival?</p><p>The philosophical question of whether we should allow some of our freedoms to be eroded slightly in an emergency has a simple answer: Yes. It is in the collective, utilitarian good. Whether we should trust the Indian Government or Big Tech to husband our data is a different question. Your mileage may vary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OPEN-0053218580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OPEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW7-PFP1-DXMP-K0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Open, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Open</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 11, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

For the last quarter century the story of these places has been one of relentless economic decline. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  This is, of course, not news to the people who live in rural and small-town America, who have been fighting for years to reverse this decline. But now, the nation's political class is finally noticing. The election of <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>powered in no small degree by rural voters, has brought the troubles of small-town America to national attention, with an urgent question: What can be done to revive it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Rural America is getting old. The median age is 43, seven years older than city dwellers. Its productivity, defined as output per worker, is lower than urban America's. Its families have lower incomes. And its share of the population is shrinking: the United States has grown by 75 million people since 1990, but this has mostly occurred in cities and suburbs. Rural areas have lost some 3 million people. Since the 1990s, problems such as crime and opioid abuse, once associated with urban areas, are increasingly rural phenomena.</p><p>  Rural communities once captured a greater share of the nation's prosperity. During the economic recovery of 1992 to 1996, 135,000 new businesses were started in small counties, a third of the nation's total. Employment in small counties shot up by 2.5 million, or 16 percent, twice the pace experienced in counties with million-plus populations.</p><p>  These days, economic growth bypasses rural economies. In the first four years of the recovery after the 2008 recession, counties with fewer than 100,000 people lost 17,500 businesses, according to the Economic Innovation Group. By contrast, counties with more than 1 million residents added, altogether, 99,000 firms.</p><p>  The Economic Innovation Group measures ''distress'' as a combination of data ranging from joblessness and poverty to abandoned homes and educational attainment. Since the 1990s, there has been an ''intensifying ruralization of distress,'' said John Lettieri, the group's president.</p><p>  I've lived most of my life in big cities. I don't pretend to understand what it's like to live in a small town or on a family farm, or how it feels when all the jobs in a community seem to be fading away. I do spend a lot of time thinking about how the economic changes of the last several decades have undercut many American workers. One thing seems clear to me: nobody -- not experts or policymakers or people in these communities -- seems to know quite how to pick rural America up.</p><p>  States, municipalities and the federal government have spent billions to draw jobs and prosperity to stagnant rural areas. But they haven't yet figured out how to hitch this vast segment of the country to the tech-heavy economy that is flourishing in America's cities.</p><p>  There are 1,888 counties in America in which more than half the population is rural, according to the Census Bureau, and they stretch from coast to coast. In Comanche County, a land of cattle, farming, oil and gas on the plains of southwestern Kansas, 1,790 people live in an area of nearly 800 square miles. In Perry County -- home to some 26,500 people in Eastern Kentucky -- so far no other industry has replaced once-mighty coal. Essex County in New York's Adirondacks is three-quarters rural. So is Calaveras County in California.</p><p>  After World War II, small town prosperity relied on its contribution to the industrial economy. The census considers Price County, Wis., to be 100 percent rural. Still, over a third of the jobs there are in manufacturing, from building industrial machines to assembling trucks. Auto parts manufacturers in West Point, Georgia, draw workers from all over Troup County. Manufacturing employs about one in eight workers in the country's 704 entirely rural counties. That's more than agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining combined and second only to education, health care and social assistance, which includes teachers, doctors, nurses and social service counselors.</p><p>  But factory jobs can no longer keep small-town America afloat. Even after a robust eight-year growth spell, there are fewer than 13 million workers in manufacturing across the entire economy. Robots and workers in China put together most of the manufactured goods that Americans buy, and the high-tech industries powering the economy today mostly need highly educated workers. They find those most easily in big cities, not in small towns.</p><p>  Consider Lake County, in Tennessee. Some 7,500 people live there, about 500 less than in the mid-1990s. Lake County is betting on a new industrial park on Cates Landing on the Mississippi River. But it will be tough to reverse years of declining employment. Between 2013 and 2017, the county averaged fewer than 250 manufacturing jobs, half as many as it had in 2000.</p><p>  What to do? Since the presidential election in 2016, when small town voters enthusiastically endorsed the populist campaign of President Trump, policymakers and academics have thrown themselves at understanding the economic backdrop to their frustrations. They have come up with no shortage of proposals for how to turn rural America around, from offering a tax credit for employers that hire workers in distressed communities to designing investment funds to draw venture capital into rural areas.</p><p>  In a report published in November, Mark Muro, William Galston and Clara Hendrickson of the Brookings Institution identify critical shortages bedeviling declining communities, and they have plans to address them: I.T. training and education initiatives, regulatory changes to boost lending to small businesses, incentives to invest in broadband.</p><p>  Wisely, they suggest that any federal government effort must choose its targets carefully. Better to focus on middle-sized places that are near big tech hubs and have some critical infrastructure, rather than scatter assistance all over.</p><p>  Sound as these ideas may be, even the authors concede that they may not be up to the task. ''I don't know if these ideas are going to work,'' Mr. Galston acknowledged when I pressed him on the issue. ''But it is worth making the effort.''</p><p>  This is the inescapable reality of agglomeration, one of the most powerful forces shaping the American economy over the last three decades. Innovative companies choose to locate where other successful, innovative companies are. That's where they can find lots of highly skilled workers. The more densely packed these pools of talent are, the more workers can learn from each other and the more productive they become. This dynamic feeds on itself, drawing more high-tech firms and highly skilled workers to where they already are.</p><p>  ''We have a spatial reorganization of the economy,'' said Mr. Muro. ''We have an archipelago of superstars in an ocean of low-productivity sectors.''</p><p>  In hindsight, no amount of tax incentives would have convinced Amazon to expand in a medium-sized city such as Columbus, Ohio, rather than Northern Virginia and Queens, which sit in some of the largest pools of talent in the country. If even medium-sized cities find it difficult to compete, what are the odds that, say, a small town like Amory, Miss., where 14 percent of adults have a bachelor's degree and a quarter of its 2,500 workers work in small-scale manufacturing, have a chance to attract well-paid tech jobs?</p><p>  Consider a recent Brookings Institution study by Benjamin Austin, Edward Glaeser and Lawrence Summers. They focus on the alarming rate of joblessness in the region roughly between the Mississippi River and the states on the Atlantic coast, where rural communities are doing particularly poorly.</p><p>  They conclude that a targeted employment subsidy, such as the earned-income tax credit, is probably the most powerful tool available to revive employment. But they, too, are not sure it will work. ''Our call for a wage subsidy is us saying, 'We can't figure this out, and we hope the private sector will,' '' Mr. Glaeser told me.</p><p>  There are, to be sure, some rural communities with productivity as high as some big cities. But they rely on heavily mechanized and automated industries that support few jobs: oil extraction or large-scale agriculture, in which tractors talk to satellites and no drivers are involved. The livestock business on the vast pastures of Sioux County, Neb., for example, supports an economy worth $306,000 per worker, according to data from Mr. Muro and Jacob Whiton of Brookings. But only 1,200 people live there.</p><p>  Excluding these places, the United States is still left with 50 to 55 million people living in rural communities that no longer have much to offer them economically.</p><p>  What if nothing really works? Is there really no option but to do nothing and, as some have suggested, return depopulated parts of rural America to the bison?</p><p>  Instead of so-called place-based policies to revitalize small towns, why not help their residents take advantage of opportunities where the opportunities are? Geographic mobility hit a historical low in 2017, when only 11 percent of Americans picked up shop and moved -- half the rate of 1951. One of the key reasons is that housing in the prosperous cities that offer the most opportunities has become too expensive.</p><p>  The most helpful policy for people in small towns could be to relax zoning rules in dense cities like New York and San Francisco, so that more affordable housing could be built to receive newcomers, and they wouldn't need the income of an investment banker or a computer scientist to afford to live there.</p><p>  Policymakers might not want to push too hard against agglomeration. It adds to American prosperity. As Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, points out, a successful strategy to draw innovative firms away from mega-clusters to small-town America would reduce overall innovation. ''If you put a tech company in a place like rural Indiana, it will be vastly less productive than if you put it in a tech cluster,'' Mr. Moretti said. ''The effect is quite large.''</p><p>  Still, there are compelling reasons to try to help rural economies rebound. Many people -- especially older people and the family members who care for them -- choose to remain in rural areas. What's more, the costs of rural poverty are looming over American society. Think of opioid addiction, of the spike in crime, of the wasted human resources in places where only a third of adults hold a job.</p><p>  And if today's polarized politics are noxious, what might they look like in a country perpetually divided between diverse, prosperous liberal cities and a largely white rural America in decline? As Mr. Galston warned: ''Think through the political consequences of saying to a substantial portion of Americans, which is even more substantial in political terms, 'We think you're toast.' ''</p><p>  The distress of 50 million Americans should concern everyone. Powerful economic forces are arrayed against rural America and, so far, efforts to turn it around have failed. Not every small town can be a tech hub, nor should it be. But that can't be the only answer.</p><p>  Eduardo Porter, an economics writer for The Times, is the author of a forthcoming book about race and the American social contract.</p><p>  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram,</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Lake County, Tenn. is trying to reverse years of declining employment.

This was the moment which opened the way for the emergence of the likes of Motorola and Texas Instruments as some of the biggest names in technology.</p><p>Lawmakers could give the titans of Silicon Valley an ultimatum: You have an effective monopoly, if you don't want that to end you should share key algorithms and licence patents so companies old and new can have the best chance of thriving in the new economy.</p><p>Such a showdown would be a grand test for governments in an age when companies can move headquarters and cash around the world. It could require unprecedented cooperation.</p><p>This is why President Emmanuel Macron argues that membership of the EU enhances rather diminishes France's sovereignty.</p><p>He told the journalist \u00c9ric Fottorino: \"France cannot win against Google and Facebook, but Europe can [at] least regulate them.\"</p><p>US President Donald Trump has an aversion to international trade deals, so it is hard to imagine him working with the EU (and perhaps a post-Brexit UK) to regulate American companies but politicians on both the left and the right may decide too much power and wealth is now concentrated in the hands of a few internet moguls.</p><p>Today's lawmakers are haunted by the 2008 financial crisis which demonstrated the calamities that can result when the global financial system is tied to the fortunes of a cluster of banks that are too big to fail. Politicians who make the argument that monopolies are bad for the economy and workers can cast themselves as reformers.</p><p>Support for a shake-up could also come from figures on the right who cheered when Margaret Thatcher and her colleagues privatised giant public utilities companies on the grounds that competition and choice drive up quality for the consumer.</p><p>Whether there would be public excitement is another matter entirely. Tens of thousands of people may wake up each morning fuming about Russian election meddling on social media but hundreds of millions enjoy checking out the latest antics of nieces and nephews and grandchildren and classmates on Facebookand Instagram.</p><p>It is maddening when your home wifi goes down. But there might be outcry if word got around that politicians wanted to make it harder for you to watch a dancing cat on You-Tube or buy slippers that look like some variant of furry animal on Amazon.</p><p>A great debate, and possibly a struggle, is starting about how the power and wealth of companies that have subtly but significantly recast our lives as both consumers and citizens. This is not just a dilemma about wealth distribution and privacy in the online age; it is a question about what sort of world we want our children to inherit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>&lt;B Facebookfounder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is under pressure to respond to a request by MPs to appear before them to give evidence about the tech giant's links to political analysis consultancy Cambridge Analytica</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WESTML-135929874</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WESTML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYN-YH91-DY9P-N4FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244366</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Western Mail and Echo Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Western Mail</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0008OT5</classCode><className>BELL LABORATORIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I never studied science past the most elementary level. I certainly don't pretend to know anything about the effects on human brain cells of electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I do have a lifetime's experience of long-form television journalism, as a producer, reporter and editor. And, in my opinion, Dr Maryanne Demasi, of the ABC's Catalyst program, just doesn't understand the difference between journalism and advocacy.</p><p>Demasi's modus operandi is becoming all too familiar. Find a scary thesis that is bound to resonate with many ordinary Australians: people who take statins to lower the chances of cardiovascular disease; parents of young people who are being prescribed antidepressants; people who use mobile telephones a lot, and - a far bigger cohort - the parents of children who use Wi-Fi devices.</p><p>Find advocates in the scientific world who have plausible credentials - plausible, at least to the layperson - and who challenge the prevailing scientific orthodoxy: advocates who claim statins are not decreasing, and might even be increasing, the risk of mortality in many of those who are taking them; that antidepressants are inducing psychosis or suicidal tendencies in young people; that prolonged mobile telephone use is probably increasing the risk of brain tumours, and that all Wi-Fi devices might yet prove to be dangerous, especially to children.</p><p>Give those advocates the lion's share of the space on the ABC's most popular television science program, with the absolute minimum of sceptical challenge. Include token appearances by representatives of the scientific orthodoxy, while implying that various vested interests - big pharma, big telecom, big tech - have undue influence over the regulators.</p><p>Then, when defenders of the scientific orthodoxy cry \"foul\", claim they are attempting to muzzle legitimate debate.</p><p>\"As an investigative journalist, I am used to taking some heat from critics. It's part of the job,\" Demasi wrote in The Huffington Post last week, in the wake of the familiar outcry that followed her latest Catalyst report, on the alleged risks of radio waves.</p><p>But Demasi's critics aren't powerful corporations or aggrieved politicians. All too often, they are scientists and doctors of unimpeachable reputation. Her program on statins was found, after an exhaustive inquiry by its audience and consumer affairs department, to be in breach of the ABC's own editorial policies. Her investigation into the use and alleged misuse of antidepressants never made it to air at all. And last week's program made on the dangers of radio-frequency waves made claims that even some of its participants disavow.</p><p>I spoke on Monday to Professor Bruce Armstrong, of Sydney University, the country's most respected cancer epidemiologist. By taking part in Demasi's program, he gave it some much-needed scientific credibility - especially when he confirmed that recent studies \"do suggest ... there is an association between heavy mobile phone use and brain tumours\".</p><p>But the Catalyst program suggested much more than that. It's title, after all, was \"Wi-Fried?\" Demasi's first line of narration was alarming: \"Wi-Fi blankets our homes, our cities and our schools.\"</p><p>That line led straight to this grab from the program's most-favoured interviewee, American epidemiologist Dr Devra Davis: \"Children today are growing up in a sea of radio-frequency microwave radiation that did not exist five years ago.\"</p><p>Armstrong told me unequivocally: we can \"draw no conclusions whatsoever\" about the health effects of Wi-Fi from studies into the effects of mobile phone use.</p><p>What solid evidence we were offered in \"Wi-Fried\" almost all related to mobile phone use. Yet Davis and Demasi's other favoured interviewees all talked menacingly about the threat to our children from Wi-Fi devices in general: in Demasi's words, from \"mobile phones, tablets, phone towers, smart meters, baby monitors and Wi-Fi routers\".</p><p>\"We always knew Dr Davis was a dissenting voice in this debate. But that's never a reason not to interview someone,\" Demasi writes in The Huffington Post.</p><p>Perhaps not. But it might be a good reason not to give her massively more time than anyone else in a program that purports to be an objective investigation. Davis is an advocate. By weighting the program so heavily in her favour, Demasi and Catalyst become advocates, too.</p><p>\"Catalyst was accused of scaremongering,\" Demasi continues. \"It's an overused term ... Reporting on terrorist threats, the Zika virus and crime sprees could also be argued to cause anxiety among the general population.\"</p><p>Indeed. And when terrorist threats, and health scares, and crime statistics are exaggerated, by politicians looking for votes or by newspapers looking for readers, \"scaremongering\" is just what it is.</p><p>\"Wi-Fried\", in my view, was scaremongering. It is inconceivable it would have passed the rigorous self-policing that goes on at a program like Four Corners.</p><p>The ABC now has an editorial director who is supposed to be ensuring the same editorial standards are applied to all ABC content. Alan Sunderland tells me that, although it was not referred to him personally, \"the program sought, received and acted on editorial advice in the normal way\".</p><p>Well, Alan, it seems to me it is Maryanne Demasi who has been proceeding in her normal way. In the process, she's doing the reputation of ABC science reporting incalculable harm.</p><p>I'd say your normal processes need toughening up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Catalyst host Maryanne Demasi.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6ok48wkdgz4l03udisa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J52-GDW1-F0J6-J3H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 24, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Labour/Occupations/Journalists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Company/Australian Broadcasting Corporation/ABC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media/Television/Programs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001113</classCode><className>MENTAL ILLNESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

In line with this vision, QNB Group will continue to invest strategically while ensuring adequate due diligence in markets to expand its geographic footprint, primarily in MEASEA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new markets have been identified using the following criteria: the macroeconomic outlook; banking sector penetration and growth potential, that is, competitive attractiveness); the ability to follow QNB's existing customers; balancing QNB's risk appetite; and regulatory requirements for market entry. Banks with strong operations in more than one country will definitely be favoured. In 2019 QNB obtained regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to open a branch in Hong Kong, one of the world's global financial centres. The branch will provide a full range of banking products and services, and is another vital step in QNB Group's international expansion plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In light of the recent merger between Barwa Bank and the International Bank of Qatar, how can the sector benefit from further consolidation?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AL KHALIFA:</emphasis> The banking sector is undergoing a fundamental transition worldwide. With more and more financial services being offered outside the scope of the traditional banking sector, through the development of financial technology, shadow banks and big tech players, there is a strong pressure on the banking sector to consolidate. By doing so, banks can create economies of scale and drive down their cost-to-income ratios.</p><p>Consolidation also allows banks to invest more in their products and capabilities, allowing them to maintain relevance and competitiveness in line with changing customer requirements. As a result, consolidation tends to lower individual firm risk and increase the overall stability of the financial system as a whole.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you evaluate the Qatar Central Bank's second strategic plan, especially in terms of its aims to develop financial literacy and human capital?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AL KHALIFA:</emphasis> The central themes of the second strategic plan are: regulatory cooperation; market development and financial innovation; maintaining integrity and confidence in the financial ecosystem; financial inclusion and literacy; and strengthening human capital.</p><p>QNB has undertaken various initiatives to educate customers about financial planning and management both in Qatar and across our network. For example, the QNB Prepaid Card enables greater financial inclusion by allowing previously unbanked populations to access credit facilities. In 2018 the monetary value in terms of net sales for prepaid cards was QR225m ($61.7m), a volume increase of 81% compared to 2017. Internationally, we collaborated with Prestasi Junior School in Indonesia to help achieve financial literacy in Jakarta. We have also participated in the Central Bank of Egypt's recent financial inclusion initiative.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does QNB's positive credit rating mean for the economy and, more specifically, the banking sector?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AL KHALIFA:</emphasis> Fitch Ratings affirmed QNB's credit rating at \"A+\" with a stable outlook, while several other agencies have maintained positive ratings for Qatar. The banking sector in Qatar remains healthy, reflecting high asset quality, strong capitalisation and high profitability. Non-performing loans were low at 1.9% of total loans in 2018 and returns to equity were high at 15.3%. Banks comply fully with Basel III capital adequacy standards, with a capital adequacy ratio of 18.0% at end-2018. The strong ratings reflect the capital strength, governance, prudent risk management and financial success of the banking sector. This provides local banks with a competitive advantage in accessing global capital markets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-956483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-NS21-DXYV-71PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It's something that should have been  taken care of, years ago, decades ago.  It's at a point now where we don't  really have a choice.  This must be taken care of one way or the other.  </p><p>I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un and hopefully, that will be a  success, and maybe it will be, and maybe it won't be, we don't know, but we  will see what happens.  But I can say this, they do respect this.  We are  respectful of them and we are going to see what happens.  We will bring up  the abduct case.  We will bring up many different things.  I think it's a  time to talk and it's a time for solving problems.  </p><p>I know that's been a very big factor to you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).  </p><p>TRUMP:  South Korea's meetings with North Korea are very much in  coordination with us, and in consultation with them constantly.  Our  relationship with South Korea is a very good one.  In fact, we are in the  midst of negotiating a new and better, perhaps for both sides, straight  deal.  Right now, it's an unfair deal frankly to the United States, but  what else is new?  All of them are.  </p><p>But we are going to finalize a new deal fairly soon.  We probably could  have them already.  I want to have it done, but we are in very close  communication and coordination with South Korea with their upcoming  meetings and even encouraged talks with North Korea and as I said before,  the war has never ended.  If we could do something even before the meeting,  these big plans of meeting, that would be fine, but we are dealing very  closely with South Korea.  </p><p>They are the ones that came and told us about the original meeting that  they want to meet with me.  They want to meet with the United States  specifically.  We have not picked the site yet, but we picked five sites  where it's potentially going to be.  We'll let you know fairly soon and we  will see what happens.  </p><p>We'll either have a very good meeting or we won't have a good meeting and  maybe we won't even have a meeting at all depending on what's going in, but  I think that there is a great chance to solve a world problem.  This is not  a problem for the United States...  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>TRUMP:  ... it's not a problem for Japan or any other country, it's a  problem for the world.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Donald Trump there where  President Trump with the Japanese Prime Minister with some very interesting  comments about North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un.  No rocket man  references, instead called him by name, said we respect them, they respect  us.  Talked about the potential for the meeting with Kim in which he said  he thought it would be successful.  He hopes it will be, but it might not  be.  </p><p>But he said that they would hold a meeting if that was to take place, he  was looking forward to it.  And on the question of South Korea, again,  talking about the trade deal that he hopes, and now, just on the deals in  terms of North Korea and the various bilateral talks taking place.  </p><p>While we monitor, we will move on.  A very good evening to you and this is  \"Quest Means Business\" where tonight Starbucks has announced dramatic  action to address the discrimination scandal.  </p><p>Starbucks is to close its 8,000 US coffee stores in the afternoon on May  29th to educate its employees about racial bias.  And the reason of course,  following on from the uproar over this arrest of two black men at a  Starbucks in Philadelphia.  </p><p>The men were doing nothing, literally.  They were waiting for a friend  before ordering.  After they were refused permission to use the restroom,  the store managers called the police, the men were arrested for  trespassing.  </p><p>Protest and criticism followed.  The Chief Executive, Kevin Johnson has  promised the company will learn lessons.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS:  I want to apologize to the community in  Philadelphia and to all my Starbucks partners.  This is not who we are and  it is not who we are going to be.  </p><p>We are going to learn from this and we will be better forward.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, Starbucks is now actually putting its actions where its words  are, or where the CEO's words are.  Let's remind ourselves what Starbucks's  values, mission and statement actually says.  It says, \"Our values with our  priorities are...\" basically, so far, I can't even read it.  What does that  actually say.  </p><p>It says, \"Our values to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person,  one cup, one neighborhood at a time.  With our partners, we will fill these  values.  Creating a culture of warmth, belonging where everyone is  welcome.\"  And importantly at the end, \"Holding ourselves accountable to  results.\"  </p><p>Joining me now, Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia and a CNN  contributor, Rashad Robinson is the executive director at Color of Change,  also on the Board of Demos, one of the organizations Starbucks is  consulting with over its awareness.  They are both in Atlanta for us  tonight.  </p><p>Mr. Mayor, first with you, are you content now that Starbucks has done  sufficient?  </p><p>MICHAEL NUTTER, FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA:  Well, Richard, let me first  say, this is unprecedented.  It is bold.  It is certainly dynamic.  CEO,  Kevin Johnson, Chief Operating Officer, Rosalind Brewer and even Board  Chairman, Howard Schultz, all on the ground in Philadelphia demonstrating  an understanding and a sensitivity after the terrible tragedy and incident  in Philadelphia.  </p><p>But, taking as you pointed out, taking unprecedented action to try to  address some of the elements here.  They've put a lot of stuff out there.   They already have many activities going on in Philadelphia and across the  country, so you know, they are making steps.  </p><p>QUEST:  No, but that's not what I asked, sir.  I mean, they are making  steps, but is it sufficient?  I mean, at this stage in the process what  they have done?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Well, I think they've done a lot since, I guess this all happened  last Thursday and kind of blew up over the weekend.  I am not sure in two  or three days how much more you can do, again, Richard, I don't know of any  CEO, I don't know him, but I don't know of any CEO who has ever gone to a  city when some incident happened.  </p><p>QUEST:  Got it.  </p><p>NUTTER:  And literally looked somebody in the eye and apologized to him.  </p><p>QUEST:  Rashad, if this was a textbook, it would be a textbook case on how  to handle a crisis, any company is going to have miscreant behavior,  negligent behavior, malicious behavior, any company the size of Starbucks.   It's not what happens, it's what you do about it, surely.  </p><p>RASHAD ROBINSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COLOR OF CHANGE:  Absolutely, and  Starbucks a real opportunity to lead here.  The issue will be, it's not  just the input, but what actually comes out of it.  Do we see real results?   Across social media, across our membership at Color of Change, we are  hearing from people who have had their incidents...  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>ROBINSON:  ... at Starbucks.  I have been in touch with the leadership at  Starbucks and know that they are hearing and they are trying to move  forward.  But this is not a conversation about one bad store or one bad  apple or even one bad corporation that has had a challenge here in  Starbucks.  </p><p>Starbucks has an opportunity to really lead, but there is a whole community  and folks that are at play here.  </p><p>QUEST:  But, Rashad, you say it has an opportunity to lead.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  But why do you say it has an opportunity?  Surely, it is leading.   I mean, are you not giving -- I mean, the mayor gives some credit for what  they are doing in the short period of time.  Do you give them the same  credit for what they are doing?  </p><p>ROBINSON:  I absolutely give them credit for what they have done in the  short period of time, and what I have to say as someone who is -- like the  mayor, been in this work for a number of years is that we will look back on  this time a year from now, two years from now, three years from now and see  actually, did these actions lead to the type of results, the type of  changes, real world changes in to people's lives.  </p><p>QUEST:  Mr. Mayor, arguably, you know, corporations will follow because  where profits go, and then people boycott therefore, but the police in all  of this.  Now, there is a real role surely, Mr. Mayor to be answered about  why the police -- obviously, they asked the men to leave, and obviously,  you know, at some point they realized there was no other way to handle this  than to arrest them.  </p><p>Surely, the police needs to be looking at their own actions in this.  </p><p>NUTTER:  And I believe, Police Commissioner Ross will continue that kind of  work, but again, Richard, we go back to the beginning.  The police should  never have been called in the first place.  That was the first error.  </p><p>And I said last night, you know, police officers do have some amount of  discretion.  You know, if you go through a red light, every person does not  get a traffic ticket when that happens.  Officers take a lot of factors  into consideration.  </p><p>This one, it seems the officers went into a little bit of a rock and a hard  place.  They've got a store manager saying, \"These people are trespassing,  we don't want them in the store anymore.\"  They have been called, you know,  maybe different officers, maybe a different decision.  Supervisors et  cetera, et cetera.  But I believe that Police Commissioner Ross and the  folks over at the Philadelphia Police Department will also reexamine their  own actions in this particular (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Actually, actually, this is where I have to disagree with the  Mayor respectfully.  Absolutely, the first thing that the Police Chief came  out and said was that the police officers did nothing wrong, but he was  going to do an investigation.  </p><p>This -- over and over again, in cities around the country, in communities  around the country, police cannot police themselves.  We have  (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  Hang on, hang on, Rashad.  Hang on, hang on.  On the point that  you've just raised, all right, what in your view should the police have  done, faced with a Catch 22 that the Mayor talks about.  </p><p>Starbucks doesn't want them there.  The original error has been made the  police have been called, but now they are faced with a situation where  somebody is refusing a lawful police instruction to leave the property.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Yes, I mean, the question is why was there that police  instruction in the first place?  The conversation between the manager about  why they were supposed to leave, then the conversation with the other  patrons about whether or not they were causing a problem.  Whether or not  the police instruction was fair in the first place, whether or not that  police instruction would have happened if those folks were white, would  have happened.  </p><p>The fact of the matter is that there is a different type of standards and  laws if you are black in America versus if you are white and for a police  department which has a fraternal order of police, which not only endorsed  Donald Trump, but stands behind him even after Charlottesville, this police  department does not get the benefit of the doubt in black communities and  they need to be held accountable and political leaders cannot enable them.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, gentlemen, I do need to end it there, gentlemen...  </p><p>NUTTER:  We don't want to let the actions of a few tarnish the brave men  and women of the Philadelphia Police Department.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  This is not a conversation about bad apples.  This is a  conversation about structural policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  Gentlemen, gentlemen, there's a reason why I have a bell on this  desk and it is to say, gentlemen, thank you both very much for joining in  our discussion tonight.  </p><p>Now, to something that is really quite extraordinary.  Let me put it like  this.  If the current situation in Washington with the President was a  movie, with all of its various actors and participants, you would say, it's  too far-fetched.  If it was a book, you'd say it is not believable.  It  simply couldn't happen, and yet, we have a cast of characters at the summit  of America's government.  </p><p>Imagine it's a movie trailer.  No disrespect, but imagine you're watching a  movie trailer.  You have the President, a billionaire businessman and  former TV reality star who faces numerous allegations of sexual  misconducts, who is rejecting accusation...  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  ... of an affair with the porn actress, Stormy Daniels who is paid  with $130,000.00 to stay silent, by none other by the President's lawyer,  Michael Cohen, the fixer whose office is then searched by the FBI looking  for evidence of campaign collusions with Russians and in a courtroom drama  moment, discovers an undisclosed client who is revealed to be the star  presenter of Fox News, Sean Hannity, who happens to be a close friend of  the President and his most vocal supporter, the host.  </p><p>All the while as this maelstrom continues, a former, deep insider reveals  all.  James Comey, the Director of the FBI fired by the President who is  having the alleged affair with the porn actress who was with the lawyer who  was paid off at the same time.  </p><p>And now, takes revenge by describing the Commander-in-Chief as morally  unfit.  If you read this or saw it in a movie, you would not believe it.  </p><p>David Gergen, you would say this is incredulous, this couldn't happen.   Checks and balances.  You couldn't have this sort of behavior.  Somebody  would find out.  Which bit of this do you find the most distressing?  </p><p>DAVID GERGEN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, CNN:  Well, it certainly is going  to put a lot of novelists out of business -- that is never as should.  I  think what I find the most puzzling is the degree which there seems to be a  web or network of individuals now who are one reason or another under  investigation or in trouble with the law.  </p><p>And that we've never seen before.  I worked in the Nixon White House as a  young guy.  I can tell you in one case, we had a sort of a sole person in  the President himself who was pulling people towards him to commit criminal  acts, but there was no web.  </p><p>And so, I found it when James Comey and his book and his interviews have  been saying his first reaction upon encountering the Trump team was that,  it was like, the days when he was working against the mob and prosecuting  members of a mob.  And that there was a sort of sense of belonging to a  group, a filth he demanded of the leader if you would, and a real sense of  we're a brotherhood, we have our standards.  Nobody else in the country may  understand our standards or agree with him, but we're here and we're in  charge.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, all right, in that scenario and take for example today, the  President tweets that Comey should be in jail.  Comey, the former head of  the FBI tweets, \"We must never accept that this is normal.  It's not normal  for the President of the United States to say people should be locked up,\"  as he did once of course about Hillary Clinton.  What do you make of it?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Well, I think Comey is right.  I mean, this has become a mud fight  and Comey says some things that are I think, have given offense to others.   But I must say, this President for whatever reason seems to take lightly  the whole idea that when you are elected President of the United States,  you can punish your enemies by putting them in jail.  </p><p>You know, from the campaign on, he saying, remember, \"Lock her up.  Lock  her up.\" A chant in a lot of Trump rallies that Michael Flynn encouraged  that chant, and you know, right here now, the President saying Comey ought  to be put in jail.  That's what you see in a Banana Republic, you know,  that if you win the election, you put the other side in jail.  That's the  way you deal with it.  </p><p>Frankly, you see it in autocratic countries and the authoritarian countries  where you put your enemies in jail.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so yesterday you would have read the \"New York Times\" four- page editorial against the actions of say the President and of course the  Republican leadership, which leads me to ask with great respect, how  worried are you for the system?  How worried are you that real damage is  being done to the fabric of the Constitutional system which will take years  if it can't be repaired?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Well, I think it is doing damage not only internally in the United  States, but hurting our reputation overseas.  We pride ourselves of being a  model, if you would, with the rule of law and respect for the rule of law  and what I am worried about now is, here internally in the United States is  not so much about the checks and balances.  Those are still operating just  as they did down in Watergate and Watergate with the Congress and the press  and others, but especially the press and the court being very tough on the  administration.  </p><p>But what is very, I think distressing and dangerous here, Richard is not  the checks and balances.  It is whether we maintain the traditions, the  norms as they...  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>GERGEN:  ... are called, which helped to create a civilized nation so that  people have certain expectations that others will be truthful, that they  will be -- that there will be transparency, there will be accountability  and all of those things are being sort of kicked aside and I do worry that  this becomes a way of life, you know.  </p><p>You've got a President who lies or misleads you five times a day as some of  the data suggests, you know, what is that teaching our kids about how to  behave as adults?  </p><p>QUEST:  David, thank you, sir.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>QUEST:  Who knows what the next chapter or the next sequel in this story  will be?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Always spinning.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, good to see you, David Gergen joining me from  Washington.  We will take a break.  We'll have the markets afterwards, and  if you think it's all too far-fetched, just look at the chart and wonder  what comes next?  </p><p>By this time tomorrow, the curtain will have risen on Saudi Arabia's first  cinema in over three decades.  The AMC Complex will open in the capital,  Riyadh after a 35-year ban on movie theaters which lifted in December.   Adam Aaron is AMC's Chief Executive Officer, CEO and joins me now live.  </p><p>The cold question or the first question is, what will you be showing when  the movies begin tomorrow night?  </p><p>ADAM AARON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMC ENTERTAINMENT:  Well, there has  been a lot of press about that and we have not confirmed the story, but  since you broke the story way back in November, we're going to confirm it  here with you, we are showing \"Black Panther,\" the third most successful  movie of all time in the United States, and it will air about 19 hours from  now in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as you said, a historic day, the first time in  35 years that cinemas have functioned in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>QUEST:  You've gone for a winner there, Adam.  You've gone for an absolute  winner.  Nothing like getting them in for that one.  All right, so listen,  when this opens, what are the ground rules that you will be operating under  and I say ground rules, but you know what I mean.  What is your  understanding of what you will show and what you will not show?  </p><p>AARON:  Well, we are going to show typical Hollywood blockbusters that are  very popular in the United States and in Europe and elsewhere in the world.   You know, Hollywood has been showing movies in the Middle East for a long  time.  It has proven that it could be sensitive to the local cultures here  in the region and we are very confident that the big movies in the United  States are going to be big movies in Saudi too.  </p><p>QUEST:  How significant is the Saudi market going to be for you?  I mean,  you are well and truly a head of the pack here, and you know, you're  obviously starting to mount on your competitors?  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>AARON:  Well, we certainly are way out front in Saudi Arabia at AMC.  We  have been at this now for -- since September.  We have met with the highest  levels of government.  I had the great privilege to meet, His Royal  Highness, the Crown Prince and hear from him directly how important it was  to reopen cinemas four decades in and here we are, we have an agreement  with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Saudi Arabia who is our partner here.  We  could not possibly have a better partner.  </p><p>It's our goal to open about half of all the movie theaters that opened in  this country over the next decade and as you said, we've got the first  license to operate.  We got the first license to open a cinema and we open  tomorrow night.  April 18 is going to be a historic day for the movie  industry in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>QUEST:  Adam, great to see you.  Thank you for revealing \"Black Panther\"  and you and I -- we still have got to go to the movies at some point  together so I can actually see how the owner of the movie theater, what  sort of seat he actually gets.  It's probably near the back because it's --  good to see you, sir.  </p><p>AARON:  Well, the seats he gets are the seats everyone else gets which is  nice, luxury, reclining seats, very comfortable and your choice.  Your  choice, we will do it in New York, London or now, in Riyadh.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'll buy the popcorn, you buy the colas.  Thank you, good to see  you, Adam.  </p><p>Now, investors are cheering results from America's biggest companies.   Well, we're in the earning season and our spiral share case is starting to  fill in as we track the share prices in the 24 hours.  </p><p>This is Clare.  So, Clare you stay where you are.  We will be back with you  in just a moment to put some things -- this is the true barometer of what  Wall Street thinks about the quarter gone by.  How the share price moves in  the 24 hours after results.  </p><p>Never mind the first few moments.  We will have United and IBM, they are  reporting this hour -- United Airlines.  Bank shares have remained  stubbornly down, all of them would be down and indeed we saw that today.  </p><p>If we take Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs have results which were very good  at 27 percent despite a $2.8 billion profit.  The stock has closed down 1.6  percent about sustainability of their profit, all of the banks -- Citi,  Goldman, Wells Fargo, PNC -- they've all been down, Bank of America inching  it out.  </p><p>As for Netflix, well, I told you yesterday, we talked about their results,  but now, Netflix finished up 9 percent with another 9 percent, so it's  roughly about there, which is where it would be.  Strong subscriber growth  is what is moving Netflix.  </p><p>You are seeing this sort of, at the moment, the banks have weighed the  share case down towards the lower end, but now, I expect it will start to  move up towards the higher end.  </p><p>As for the FANGS -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google -- all gained  ground during the course of the day with Facebook up 2 percent, Amazon up 4  percent, Google was up 3 percent.  That's the way it looks.  </p><p>So, Clare Sebastian has been looking at the numbers first and joining us on  the FANGs.  Why are FANGs back in stock?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Netflix.  </p><p>QUEST:  Including Netflix?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Well, this is a kind of a media pent up, you know, buying  session based on the fact that Netflix was the first of the big tech  companies, the first of the FANG to be reporting.  They were really waiting  for this moment.  It is -- although, it is a bit smaller in terms of market  cap, and it has a different kind of business model, it is still kind of a  bell weather or barometer of how the rest are going to go.  </p><p>And I think that's what led everyone to pile in.  They were waiting for an  excuse, Richard to trade on the fundamentals rather than the kind of  regulatory noise, the Trump tweets around Amazon.  All of that we were  looking at last week.  </p><p>QUEST:  But, hang on, hang on.  They still have regulatory problems...  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  ... and issues.  Amazon still hasn't dealt with its issues.   They've got issues in terms of privacy and data, even Netflix in terms of  competition, but in terms of real serious problems, three of the FANGs are  still -potentially got big issues.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  And in particular, Facebook.  I think we can almost kind of put  Facebook to one side a little bit because even though it is unclear what  Congress is going to do to regulate them, they do have the European all  coming down that is absolutely going to happen on May 25th there, General  Data Protection Regulation and that is going to impact Facebook's business.  </p><p>But I think, you know, Netflix was at a record high today.  The rest of  them are pretty much just back where they were at the end of March when we  started to see those four, so all of it is going to start to get some  context.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare, good to see you.  Thank you.  We will talk more about this.   We will talk more about technology in a moment.  </p><p>After the break, with me, Brad Smith is the President of Microsoft and  there he is, waiting out on the West.  We are going to talk about the new  deal.  The new agreement between various tech companies, right after the  break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there of course, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  When the NTSB says one person has died after  Southwest Airlines jet suffered a catastrophic engine failure at 30,000  feet. </p><p>And I'll speak to the IMF's chief economist who sound the alarm on what  protectionist is in the global economy.  And you and I continue tonight,  this is Cnn, and here on this network we guarantee you the facts always  come first.</p><p>Right now, Japan's Prime Minister is talking about trade in North Korea,  but President Trump enjoyed it.  Shinzo Abe is also calling for complete  and verifiable nuclear denuclearization, and he commended Mr. Trump for  agreeing to hold talks with North Korea's leader.</p><p>The U.S. president says he expects something to happen by early June at one  of five possible sites.  There are conflicting reports about the chemical  weapons experts have entered the Syrian city of Duma.</p><p>Syrian state television and the white helmet volunteer rescue groups saying  they have, U.S. State Department says they haven't.  The team is to access  where the banned substances were used and expected clinical attack 10 days  ago.</p><p>Theresa May; the British Prime Minister has apologized to generations of  British-Caribbean immigrants who have been denied government service, jobs  and homes and even threatened with deportation.</p><p>She said it's the Windrush scandal at a meeting with Caribbean leaders on  Tuesday.  The prime minister vowed to give more support to the immigrants  and insisted they are still welcome in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Microsoft just built a coalition with some of the biggest names in tech to  make a stand against cyber warfare.  Companies like Facebook, Cisco and  Telefonika are all part of a new accord vowing not to help government carry  out cyber attacks.</p><p>And say they will come to their users aid when they're victims of an attack  or a hack.  Microsoft's President Brad Smith joins me from San Francisco.   Always good to have you on our program.  Brad, thank you for taking the  time.</p><p>Brad, the accord, the agreement and I -- I mean, how difficult was it to  get everyone to sign up, and bearing in mind Amazon and Google haven't.</p><p>BRADFORD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT:  Well, I think this is one very  important step forward.  We brought together 34 companies from around the  world and across the industry.  And I am confident that more companies  would join in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>[16:35:00] We need to take a stand, and the stand we're taking is that  we'll protect customers around the world, we'll work together to increase  the resilience and ability to defend customers.</p><p>Then we're also saying that we won't help governments launch cyber attacks  against innocent citizens or enterprises.  I think that's -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SMITH:  Exactly what the world needs.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so is the -- is this the albeit an official non-governmental  digital Geneva Convention or at least the start of it that you have been  seeking?</p><p>SMITH:  It is the start of precisely that, I believe.  We knew in my view  that we needed to have the tech sectors step forward first.  It's easier to  bring companies together from around the world and governments from around  the world.</p><p>But we now need to build on this and really continue to call on governments  to stop attacking -- </p><p>QUEST:  But -- </p><p>SMITH:  Citizens the way we've seen.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, it's all in the definitions here though.  You know, you say  attacking innocent citizens.  I mean, if the U.S. government as some  suspect is engaged in its own version of cyber warfare or the collection of  difficult privacy information, you are basically saying you will go against  the U.S. government or the British government or the Australian government  or whoever it is.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I actually think if you look at the world today, the biggest  attacks against probably even citizens are clearly coming from a set of  governments that we know well. </p><p>It was North Korea and a group associated with it that launched a one  attack last year.  It affected hospitals across the United Kingdom and  affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries.</p><p>We saw that now Turkey attack launched against the country of Ukraine,  those are the big problems that we need to solve.  We're principle vis-a- vis every government, but there's no doubt who the biggest culprits are  today. </p><p>QUEST:  And would have thought also -- I mean, when you say we will oppose  cyber attacks on the innocent citizens, we will protect against tampering  with exploitation of technology.</p><p>We will not help governments launch cyber attacks and we will protect  customers using -- I suppose someone would say, well, I thought you were  doing that anyway?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think that in many ways most of us have -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SMITH:  But we need to bring together the industry on a global basis.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so -- </p><p>SMITH:  Because -- yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, right.  How do you -- let me just be cynical or skeptical.   I'll let you decide after you've heard the question.  How do I not take the  decision -- just a very nice document with good sounding words, but  actually has no realties behind it and the companies we'll all ignore it  whether it suits their book anyway.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think it's a fair question, Richard, and I think that as  with all such things, one needs to start with words.  Because we use words  to define principles.  But ultimately, we all need to be judged by our  deeds.</p><p>Now that we put the words down on paper, we need to live up to them and we  need to take concrete steps to implement them, and that's what we're  bringing together, others to do, that's why we're partnering with other  companies to do.</p><p>But it's more than fair for you and others to judge us by what we do in the  months and years ahead.</p><p>QUEST:  Brad, I'm going to go out to the frolic of my own here and ask you  -- you would have seen today Starbucks has announced it's closing 8,000 of  its stores for one day for racial bias training.</p><p>And this is the sort of moral leadership that companies lead, isn't it? I  mean, you know, one could argue about the event that happened in  Philadelphia, but it's how companies respond to crisis that's important.   Would you agree?</p><p>SMITH:  I do agree with that, and you know, Kevin Johnson; the CEO of  Starbucks is somebody who worked at Microsoft with us closely for many  years, in the world today, we all have our difficult days.</p><p>And as you put it quite rightly, it's how we respond to those difficult  days that are the tests of our times.  I'm not an expert on Starbucks  issues, but I do believe that there are all days when we have to stand up  for principles. </p><p>And among those principles is the importance of respect for other people  and a world that honors diversity and inclusion.  And do you think that is  getting more difficult in an era where social media social discourse, even  presidential discourse has become so difficult, so toxic that maintaining  integrity has become much trickier? </p><p>SMITH:  I think it's a challenging time, I think you're right to frame it  as a difficult time.  I think it's a time that requires the leaders,  whether they'd be in business or anywhere else.</p><p>Really understand the principles for which they want to stand up and they  have the courage of their convictions.  And there are days when -- you  know, people will disagree they have the right to. </p><p>But I do think that people ultimately respect those who have the courage of  their convictions and are clear in taking principled stands.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  Well, you said you've taken a principled stand, so with  this document, I will be watching closely in the days, weeks, months and  years ahead to see as I suspect, you expect. </p><p>SMITH:  I would expect nothing less, thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Brad, as always, thank you for taking time to join  us -- </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight.  When we come back, pretty horrific, horrifying, cared  for(ph).  A Southwest plane has an engine failure that punches the  fabric  -- that punches the fuselage and the person is killed after being nearly  sucked out of the aircraft.  After the break, we'll tell you more about it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  For anybody who flies, it's a nightmare scenario.  A person is dead  after an accident on a Southwest flight from New York to Dallas, forcing an  emergency landing because of an explosive decompression after the result of  an engine exploding.</p><p>An NTSB team is currently on its way to Philadelphia.  So this is what we  know, all believe the facts are.  The left wing number one engine as you  see here appear to explode, and then part of its fractured or entered the  cabin, blowing out one of the windows here which is you can see. </p><p>Now since the plane was in altitude, they caused an explosive decompression  we believe a passenger was almost sucked out of the aircraft before being  pulled back in again.</p><p>Over the last hour, the NTSB chairman said incidents like this are  extremely unusual. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD:  Engine  failure.  How frequent does the NTSB see what we technically do qualify as  a non-contained engine failure.</p><p>I may ask that that is about three or four a year, and not all of those  involve U.S. carriers.  In last Fall, there was a A380 that had an  uncontained engine failure over Greenland and was not a U.S. carrier. </p><p>So we see about three or four of those a year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Peter Goelz is the former managing director of the NTSB, joins me  from Washington.  What's your understanding of what happened here  particularly in the face of a first someone who died.</p><p>PETER GOELZ, FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY  BOARD:  Well, I mean, the NTSB is going to treat this as a major  investigation.  We don't know what happened.</p><p>I mean, the obvious culprit is the internal workings of the engine.  The  reality is the CFM engine is a real work horse.  You know, it doesn't need  to be overhauled for 50,000 hours.  </p><p>But something let loose or something came off that caused that engine to  disintegrate and penetrate the cabin.  And it's -- we will find out  shortly.</p><p>QUEST:  Of course Southwest had a very similar incident just a couple of  years ago, where also number one engine penetrated the fuselage, on that  occasion nobody was injured.</p><p>But it's going to raise questions on the CFM snuck-around engines. </p><p>GOELZ:  Yes it will and it will raise questions about where they're  maintained, how they're maintained.  They will look at the manufacturing of  the individual blades, if it was a blade that failed. </p><p>[16:45:00] You know, there are microscopic fatigue crash that can sometimes  go unexamined and can, you know, develop into a catastrophe.</p><p>QUEST:  If we look at the major incidents of this, and let us do the recent  ones.  I mean, you've got the BA at Las Vegas -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Right -- </p><p>QUEST:  The 777, you've got the American 76, and you have Qantas, the 32.   They all have massive engine failures where the nacelle doesn't contain the  debris.  Is this something that needs to be examined.</p><p>GOELZ:  Well, I think it does, I mean, the old theory or the current  working knowledge is that the cowling and the nacelle has to be able to,  you know, contain an engine disintegration.</p><p>You know, there's got to a major -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Titanium, if they're not being able to do that because of the brake  efficiency and the high power nature of these engines, then they're going  to have to revisit that -- their requirement.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you see any urgent or immediate NTSB action in this regard?</p><p>GOELZ:  Well, I think they're going to look very carefully if they've got  at the fan blades and at the compressors.  If they see something, they will  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Great -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Not hesitate.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally, Peter, there's an inevitability that once -- you'll be  familiar with the phrase here, the liberated parts.  And once the liberated  part are ejected from the engine, there's almost an inevitability because  of the proximity that the fuselage and the passengers become a risk.</p><p>Certainly, you saw that even more so with the old days of the delta in 1996  where you had the engine nine which went -- which blew at the back.</p><p>GOELZ:  Right, I was on scene for that accident and it was just dreadful.   And you know, those engines are nacelle-up next to the fuselage and that is  a real challenge.</p><p>QUEST:  Peter, thank you, good to see you sir, come back and help us  understand it when we get some reports from the NTSB.  Which grade would  you --  </p><p>GOELZ:  I will, thank you. </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks with you.  We continue tonight, China is taking a twin-track  approach to its trade standoff with the United States.  We're really  looking at Beijing's strategy after the break.</p><p>And of course, the chief economist at the IMF who says protectionism could  strangle global growth. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  When it comes to responding to threats about trade, China is  deploying both the carat(ph) and the stick(ph).  Here's the carat(ph), it  is the restrictions imposed on non-Chinese car makers to be removed by --  not 2022, from 2022.</p><p>[16:50:00] Until now, they had to share factory ownership and profits with  Chinese companies.  The sort of JV arrangement.  And this is the  restrictions, easier access, bad tariffs to be originated.  Now, from  Wednesday, Beijing says it will apply 117 percent tariffs on U.S. sorghum  imports. </p><p>Washington this week banned U.S. suppliers from selling parts of software  to ZTE; a major Chinese tech company because of sanctions busting.  The  shares were suspended in Hong Kong.</p><p>And the Treasury Secretary on Monday tweeted by the president on currencies  saying that that tweet was a warning shot.  Donald Trump accuse China of  devaluing its currency.</p><p>In his new world economic -- out of the will, the IMF says protectionism is  a major risk to the global economy.  Earlier on, press expressed the firm's  chief economist said countries need to be cautious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAURICE OBSTFELD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, IMF:  Of course, and we should remember  that trade is to their mutual benefit, it's been a driver of growth through  the entire post-war period.</p><p>So you know, we do worry that there could be escalation with measures and  counter measures.  We hope that countries will instead collaborate in a  multilateral spirit and resolve their differences.</p><p>QUEST:  At the moment, the environment is pretty good as you say, U.S. is  growing faster now, employment, low unemployment, low inflation but rising  interest rates.</p><p>Are you worried about the speed at which these rates are going up in the  U.S.?</p><p>OBSTFELD:  You know, the U.S. is embarking on a historically large fiscal  expansion at a time when it's at full employment.  And our projections call  for U.S. unemployment rate to fall to levels that we haven't seen since the  late 1960s. </p><p>That could pose inflation risks and the Fed would meet those by raising  interest rates perhaps more times than it's currently foreseeing.  So yes,  we do worry that there could be a spike in the interest rates and that  would not only be a U.S. issue, it would affect dollar debts worldwide.</p><p>It affects capital flows to emerging markets.</p><p>QUEST:  The president of the United States criticized Russia and China  yesterday for what he says was currency devaluations.  But he's wrong,  isn't he? There should be no managed devaluation of those currencies if  anything in the case of China, quite the opposite.</p><p>OBSTFELD:  You know, well, China has spent about a trillion dollars in  reserves, not recently but certainly in 2015 and 2016, preventing its  currency from depreciating.</p><p>You know, we judge that, it might have to appreciate a bit in the future to  keep the current account in line, but it's not grossly undervalued.  Russia  has a floating exchange rate and it has depreciated a lot recently. </p><p>But part of the reason for that has been the new sanctions on Russia. </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk finally, Maurice, as you look across the world and you  see the various factors, whether it's Brexit, higher interest rates in the  U.S., sanctions on Russia, China trade.  What is the one thing at the  moment that you would urge I should keep my eye on? </p><p>OBSTFELD:  Well, I think we should look on debts worldwide and our fiscal  monitor which comes out tomorrow will talk about that.  Whether you look at  sovereign debts, corporate debts, household debts, they're historically  high. </p><p>And as interest rates go up, as Central Banks normalize monetary policies,  there's uncertainty about what the prospects will be.  That's why we  recommend that governments in particular reduce those debts so that they  have some ammunition when the next recession comes.</p><p>And as good as things are now, we know there will be another recession some  day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  That we can be sure, another recession someday.  A sober warning  from Maurice Obstfeld.  The Dow climbed more than 200 points on Tuesday  after a number of better-than-expected earnings.</p><p>Shares have -- putting up 11 percent, and the interesting thing about that  it was only after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendations on the stock  and said user growth was picking up, IBM shares are down 5 percent, down  for us, United Airlines is up 3 percent.</p><p>Both reported earnings in this hour.  I'll look at quickly the European  bosses, the Euro bosses, Dax at its best level since February.  To get an  idea of the markets, a strong day across the board with the Dax having --  up 1.5 percent and the New York markets up strongly as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] We will take a profitable moment after a short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, Starbucks have shown us exactly how a  crisis is supposed to be handled after two men were arrested for not buying  anything and then thrown out of the store, I call this year's crisis that  hit Starbucks. </p><p>But the way the company responded first of all immediately, the CEO  apologized.  Said it was reprehensible, should not have happened, it was  wrong.  Has held a meeting with the men who were arrested to apologize  again and started training on unconscious bias. </p><p>And now finally closing the whole Starbucks network of 8,000 stores in the  United States, a one day of training.  Now of course, a one day training  isn't going to be necessarily enough, but the fact Starbucks has shown such  leadership on such a tricky, difficult issue, it speaks volumes for the way  the company is actually following its own principles.</p><p>Compare that to United Airlines or to Facebook or to Equifax and how when  they had their crisis, they had to blame somebody else, disappeared off  into the distance, weren't seen and the apology came to you too little and  too late.</p><p>No, Starbucks has proven exactly why it is so successful because it does  what it says it will do.  When things go wrong, it puts them right.  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I'm Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Let's  meet tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It's something that should have been taken care of, years ago, decades ago. It's at a point now where we don't really have a choice. This must be taken care of one way or the other.</p><p>I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un and hopefully, that will be a success, and maybe it will be, and maybe it won't be, we don't know, but we will see what happens. But I can say this, they do respect this. We are respectful of them and we are going to see what happens. We will bring up the abduct case. We will bring up many different things. I think it's a time to talk and it's a time for solving problems.</p><p>I know that's been a very big factor to you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Foreign language).</p><p>TRUMP: South Korea's meetings with North Korea are very much in coordination with us, and in consultation with them constantly. Our relationship with South Korea is a very good one. In fact, we are in the midst of negotiating a new and better, perhaps for both sides, straight deal. Right now, it's an unfair deal frankly to the United States, but what else is new? All of them are.</p><p>But we are going to finalize a new deal fairly soon. We probably could have them already. I want to have it done, but we are in very close communication and coordination with South Korea with their upcoming meetings and even encouraged talks with North Korea and as I said before, the war has never ended. If we could do something even before the meeting, these big plans of meeting, that would be fine, but we are dealing very closely with South Korea.</p><p>They are the ones that came and told us about the original meeting that they want to meet with me. They want to meet with the United States specifically. We have not picked the site yet, but we picked five sites where it's potentially going to be. We'll let you know fairly soon and we will see what happens.</p><p>We'll either have a very good meeting or we won't have a good meeting and maybe we won't even have a meeting at all depending on what's going in, but I think that there is a great chance to solve a world problem. This is not a problem for the United States...</p><p>[16:05:16]</p><p>TRUMP: ... it's not a problem for Japan or any other country, it's a problem for the world.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Foreign language).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Donald Trump there where President Trump with the Japanese Prime Minister with some very interesting comments about North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un. No rocket man references, instead called him by name, said we respect them, they respect us. Talked about the potential for the meeting with Kim in which he said he thought it would be successful. He hopes it will be, but it might not be.</p><p>But he said that they would hold a meeting if that was to take place, he was looking forward to it. And on the question of South Korea, again, talking about the trade deal that he hopes, and now, just on the deals in terms of North Korea and the various bilateral talks taking place.</p><p>While we monitor, we will move on. A very good evening to you and this is \"Quest Means Business\" where tonight Starbucks has announced dramatic action to address the discrimination scandal.</p><p>Starbucks is to close its 8,000 US coffee stores in the afternoon on May 29th to educate its employees about racial bias. And the reason of course, following on from the uproar over this arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia.</p><p>The men were doing nothing, literally. They were waiting for a friend before ordering. After they were refused permission to use the restroom, the store managers called the police, the men were arrested for trespassing.</p><p>Protest and criticism followed. The Chief Executive, Kevin Johnson has promised the company will learn lessons.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS: I want to apologize to the community in Philadelphia and to all my Starbucks partners. This is not who we are and it is not who we are going to be.</p><p>We are going to learn from this and we will be better forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So, Starbucks is now actually putting its actions where its words are, or where the CEO's words are. Let's remind ourselves what Starbucks's values, mission and statement actually says. It says, \"Our values with our priorities are...\" basically, so far, I can't even read it. What does that actually say.</p><p>It says, \"Our values to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, one neighborhood at a time. With our partners, we will fill these values. Creating a culture of warmth, belonging where everyone is welcome.\" And importantly at the end, \"Holding ourselves accountable to results.\"</p><p>Joining me now, Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia and a CNN contributor, Rashad Robinson is the executive director at Color of Change, also on the Board of Demos, one of the organizations Starbucks is consulting with over its awareness. They are both in Atlanta for us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Mayor, first with you, are you content now that Starbucks has done sufficient?</p><p>MICHAEL NUTTER, FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA: Well, Richard, let me first say, this is unprecedented. It is bold. It is certainly dynamic. CEO, Kevin Johnson, Chief Operating Officer, Rosalind Brewer and even Board Chairman, Howard Schultz, all on the ground in Philadelphia demonstrating an understanding and a sensitivity after the terrible tragedy and incident in Philadelphia.</p><p>But, taking as you pointed out, taking unprecedented action to try to address some of the elements here. They've put a lot of stuff out there. They already have many activities going on in Philadelphia and across the country, so you know, they are making steps.</p><p>QUEST: No, but that's not what I asked, sir. I mean, they are making steps, but is it sufficient? I mean, at this stage in the process what they have done?</p><p>NUTTER: Well, I think they've done a lot since, I guess this all happened last Thursday and kind of blew up over the weekend. I am not sure in two or three days how much more you can do, again, Richard, I don't know of any CEO, I don't know him, but I don't know of any CEO who has ever gone to a city when some incident happened.</p><p>QUEST: Got it.</p><p>NUTTER: And literally looked somebody in the eye and apologized to him.</p><p>QUEST: Rashad, if this was a textbook, it would be a textbook case on how to handle a crisis, any company is going to have miscreant behavior, negligent behavior, malicious behavior, any company the size of Starbucks. It's not what happens, it's what you do about it, surely.</p><p>RASHAD ROBINSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COLOR OF CHANGE: Absolutely, and Starbucks a real opportunity to lead here. The issue will be, it's not just the input, but what actually comes out of it. Do we see real results? Across social media, across our membership at Color of Change, we are hearing from people who have had their incidents...</p><p>[16:10:16]</p><p>ROBINSON: ... at Starbucks. I have been in touch with the leadership at Starbucks and know that they are hearing and they are trying to move forward. But this is not a conversation about one bad store or one bad apple or even one bad corporation that has had a challenge here in Starbucks.</p><p>Starbucks has an opportunity to really lead, but there is a whole community and folks that are at play here.</p><p>QUEST: But, Rashad, you say it has an opportunity to lead.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: But why do you say it has an opportunity? Surely, it is leading. I mean, are you not giving -- I mean, the mayor gives some credit for what they are doing in the short period of time. Do you give them the same credit for what they are doing?</p><p>ROBINSON: I absolutely give them credit for what they have done in the short period of time, and what I have to say as someone who is -- like the mayor, been in this work for a number of years is that we will look back on this time a year from now, two years from now, three years from now and see actually, did these actions lead to the type of results, the type of changes, real world changes in to people's lives.</p><p>QUEST: Mr. Mayor, arguably, you know, corporations will follow because where profits go, and then people boycott therefore, but the police in all of this. Now, there is a real role surely, Mr. Mayor to be answered about why the police -- obviously, they asked the men to leave, and obviously, you know, at some point they realized there was no other way to handle this than to arrest them.</p><p>Surely, the police needs to be looking at their own actions in this.</p><p>NUTTER: And I believe, Police Commissioner Ross will continue that kind of work, but again, Richard, we go back to the beginning. The police should never have been called in the first place. That was the first error.</p><p>And I said last night, you know, police officers do have some amount of discretion. You know, if you go through a red light, every person does not get a traffic ticket when that happens. Officers take a lot of factors into consideration.</p><p>This one, it seems the officers went into a little bit of a rock and a hard place. They've got a store manager saying, \"These people are trespassing, we don't want them in the store anymore.\" They have been called, you know, maybe different officers, maybe a different decision. Supervisors et cetera, et cetera. But I believe that Police Commissioner Ross and the folks over at the Philadelphia Police Department will also reexamine their own actions in this particular (inaudible)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBINSON: Actually, actually, this is where I have to disagree with the Mayor respectfully. Absolutely, the first thing that the Police Chief came out and said was that the police officers did nothing wrong, but he was going to do an investigation.</p><p>This -- over and over again, in cities around the country, in communities around the country, police cannot police themselves. We have (inaudible)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Hang on, hang on, Rashad. Hang on, hang on. On the point that you've just raised, all right, what in your view should the police have done, faced with a Catch 22 that the Mayor talks about.</p><p>Starbucks doesn't want them there. The original error has been made the police have been called, but now they are faced with a situation where somebody is refusing a lawful police instruction to leave the property.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes, I mean, the question is why was there that police instruction in the first place? The conversation between the manager about why they were supposed to leave, then the conversation with the other patrons about whether or not they were causing a problem. Whether or not the police instruction was fair in the first place, whether or not that police instruction would have happened if those folks were white, would have happened.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that there is a different type of standards and laws if you are black in America versus if you are white and for a police department which has a fraternal order of police, which not only endorsed Donald Trump, but stands behind him even after Charlottesville, this police department does not get the benefit of the doubt in black communities and they need to be held accountable and political leaders cannot enable them.</p><p>QUEST: All right, gentlemen, I do need to end it there, gentlemen...</p><p>NUTTER: We don't want to let the actions of a few tarnish the brave men and women of the Philadelphia Police Department.</p><p>ROBINSON: This is not a conversation about bad apples. This is a conversation about structural policy.</p><p>QUEST: Gentlemen, gentlemen, there's a reason why I have a bell on this desk and it is to say, gentlemen, thank you both very much for joining in our discussion tonight.</p><p>Now, to something that is really quite extraordinary. Let me put it like this. If the current situation in Washington with the President was a movie, with all of its various actors and participants, you would say, it's too far-fetched. If it was a book, you'd say it is not believable. It simply couldn't happen, and yet, we have a cast of characters at the summit of America's government.</p><p>Imagine it's a movie trailer. No disrespect, but imagine you're watching a movie trailer. You have the President, a billionaire businessman and former TV reality star who faces numerous allegations of sexual misconducts, who is rejecting accusation...</p><p>[16:15:16]</p><p>QUEST: ... of an affair with the porn actress, Stormy Daniels who is paid with $130,000.00 to stay silent, by none other by the President's lawyer, Michael Cohen, the fixer whose office is then searched by the FBI looking for evidence of campaign collusions with Russians and in a courtroom drama moment, discovers an undisclosed client who is revealed to be the star presenter of Fox News, Sean Hannity, who happens to be a close friend of the President and his most vocal supporter, the host.</p><p>All the while as this maelstrom continues, a former, deep insider reveals all. James Comey, the Director of the FBI fired by the President who is having the alleged affair with the porn actress who was with the lawyer who was paid off at the same time.</p><p>And now, takes revenge by describing the Commander-in-Chief as morally unfit. If you read this or saw it in a movie, you would not believe it.</p><p>David Gergen, you would say this is incredulous, this couldn't happen. Checks and balances. You couldn't have this sort of behavior. Somebody would find out. Which bit of this do you find the most distressing?</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, CNN: Well, it certainly is going to put a lot of novelists out of business -- that is never as should. I think what I find the most puzzling is the degree which there seems to be a web or network of individuals now who are one reason or another under investigation or in trouble with the law.</p><p>And that we've never seen before. I worked in the Nixon White House as a young guy. I can tell you in one case, we had a sort of a sole person in the President himself who was pulling people towards him to commit criminal acts, but there was no web.</p><p>And so, I found it when James Comey and his book and his interviews have been saying his first reaction upon encountering the Trump team was that, it was like, the days when he was working against the mob and prosecuting members of a mob. And that there was a sort of sense of belonging to a group, a filth he demanded of the leader if you would, and a real sense of we're a brotherhood, we have our standards. Nobody else in the country may understand our standards or agree with him, but we're here and we're in charge.</p><p>QUEST: So, all right, in that scenario and take for example today, the President tweets that Comey should be in jail. Comey, the former head of the FBI tweets, \"We must never accept that this is normal. It's not normal for the President of the United States to say people should be locked up,\" as he did once of course about Hillary Clinton. What do you make of it?</p><p>GERGEN: Well, I think Comey is right. I mean, this has become a mud fight and Comey says some things that are I think, have given offense to others. But I must say, this President for whatever reason seems to take lightly the whole idea that when you are elected President of the United States, you can punish your enemies by putting them in jail.</p><p>You know, from the campaign on, he saying, remember, \"Lock her up. Lock her up.\" A chant in a lot of Trump rallies that Michael Flynn encouraged that chant, and you know, right here now, the President saying Comey ought to be put in jail. That's what you see in a Banana Republic, you know, that if you win the election, you put the other side in jail. That's the way you deal with it.</p><p>Frankly, you see it in autocratic countries and the authoritarian countries where you put your enemies in jail.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so yesterday you would have read the \"New York Times\" four- page editorial against the actions of say the President and of course the Republican leadership, which leads me to ask with great respect, how worried are you for the system? How worried are you that real damage is being done to the fabric of the Constitutional system which will take years if it can't be repaired?</p><p>GERGEN: Well, I think it is doing damage not only internally in the United States, but hurting our reputation overseas. We pride ourselves of being a model, if you would, with the rule of law and respect for the rule of law and what I am worried about now is, here internally in the United States is not so much about the checks and balances. Those are still operating just as they did down in Watergate and Watergate with the Congress and the press and others, but especially the press and the court being very tough on the administration.</p><p>But what is very, I think distressing and dangerous here, Richard is not the checks and balances. It is whether we maintain the traditions, the norms as they...</p><p>[16:20:16]</p><p>GERGEN: ... are called, which helped to create a civilized nation so that people have certain expectations that others will be truthful, that they will be -- that there will be transparency, there will be accountability and all of those things are being sort of kicked aside and I do worry that this becomes a way of life, you know.</p><p>You've got a President who lies or misleads you five times a day as some of the data suggests, you know, what is that teaching our kids about how to behave as adults?</p><p>QUEST: David, thank you, sir.</p><p>GERGEN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: Who knows what the next chapter or the next sequel in this story will be?</p><p>GERGEN: Always spinning.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, good to see you, David Gergen joining me from Washington. We will take a break. We'll have the markets afterwards, and if you think it's all too far-fetched, just look at the chart and wonder what comes next?</p><p>By this time tomorrow, the curtain will have risen on Saudi Arabia's first cinema in over three decades. The AMC Complex will open in the capital, Riyadh after a 35-year ban on movie theaters which lifted in December. Adam Aaron is AMC's Chief Executive Officer, CEO and joins me now live.</p><p>The cold question or the first question is, what will you be showing when the movies begin tomorrow night?</p><p>ADAM AARON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMC ENTERTAINMENT: Well, there has been a lot of press about that and we have not confirmed the story, but since you broke the story way back in November, we're going to confirm it here with you, we are showing \"Black Panther,\" the third most successful movie of all time in the United States, and it will air about 19 hours from now in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as you said, a historic day, the first time in 35 years that cinemas have functioned in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>QUEST: You've gone for a winner there, Adam. You've gone for an absolute winner. Nothing like getting them in for that one. All right, so listen, when this opens, what are the ground rules that you will be operating under and I say ground rules, but you know what I mean. What is your understanding of what you will show and what you will not show?</p><p>AARON: Well, we are going to show typical Hollywood blockbusters that are very popular in the United States and in Europe and elsewhere in the world. You know, Hollywood has been showing movies in the Middle East for a long time. It has proven that it could be sensitive to the local cultures here in the region and we are very confident that the big movies in the United States are going to be big movies in Saudi too.</p><p>QUEST: How significant is the Saudi market going to be for you? I mean, you are well and truly a head of the pack here, and you know, you're obviously starting to mount on your competitors?</p><p>[16:25:16]</p><p>AARON: Well, we certainly are way out front in Saudi Arabia at AMC. We have been at this now for -- since September. We have met with the highest levels of government. I had the great privilege to meet, His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince and hear from him directly how important it was to reopen cinemas four decades in and here we are, we have an agreement with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Saudi Arabia who is our partner here. We could not possibly have a better partner.</p><p>It's our goal to open about half of all the movie theaters that opened in this country over the next decade and as you said, we've got the first license to operate. We got the first license to open a cinema and we open tomorrow night. April 18 is going to be a historic day for the movie industry in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>QUEST: Adam, great to see you. Thank you for revealing \"Black Panther\" and you and I -- we still have got to go to the movies at some point together so I can actually see how the owner of the movie theater, what sort of seat he actually gets. It's probably near the back because it's -- good to see you, sir.</p><p>AARON: Well, the seats he gets are the seats everyone else gets which is nice, luxury, reclining seats, very comfortable and your choice. Your choice, we will do it in New York, London or now, in Riyadh.</p><p>QUEST: I'll buy the popcorn, you buy the colas. Thank you, good to see you, Adam.</p><p>Now, investors are cheering results from America's biggest companies. Well, we're in the earning season and our spiral share case is starting to fill in as we track the share prices in the 24 hours.</p><p>This is Clare. So, Clare you stay where you are. We will be back with you in just a moment to put some things -- this is the true barometer of what Wall Street thinks about the quarter gone by. How the share price moves in the 24 hours after results.</p><p>Never mind the first few moments. We will have United and IBM, they are reporting this hour -- United Airlines. Bank shares have remained stubbornly down, all of them would be down and indeed we saw that today.</p><p>If we take Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs have results which were very good at 27 percent despite a $2.8 billion profit. The stock has closed down 1.6 percent about sustainability of their profit, all of the banks -- Citi, Goldman, Wells Fargo, PNC -- they've all been down, Bank of America inching it out.</p><p>As for Netflix, well, I told you yesterday, we talked about their results, but now, Netflix finished up 9 percent with another 9 percent, so it's roughly about there, which is where it would be. Strong subscriber growth is what is moving Netflix.</p><p>You are seeing this sort of, at the moment, the banks have weighed the share case down towards the lower end, but now, I expect it will start to move up towards the higher end.</p><p>As for the FANGS -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google -- all gained ground during the course of the day with Facebook up 2 percent, Amazon up 4 percent, Google was up 3 percent. That's the way it looks.</p><p>So, Clare Sebastian has been looking at the numbers first and joining us on the FANGs. Why are FANGs back in stock?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Netflix.</p><p>QUEST: Including Netflix?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, this is a kind of a media pent up, you know, buying session based on the fact that Netflix was the first of the big tech companies, the first of the FANG to be reporting. They were really waiting for this moment. It is -- although, it is a bit smaller in terms of market cap, and it has a different kind of business model, it is still kind of a bell weather or barometer of how the rest are going to go.</p><p>And I think that's what led everyone to pile in. They were waiting for an excuse, Richard to trade on the fundamentals rather than the kind of regulatory noise, the Trump tweets around Amazon. All of that we were looking at last week.</p><p>QUEST: But, hang on, hang on. They still have regulatory problems...</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: ... and issues. Amazon still hasn't dealt with its issues. They've got issues in terms of privacy and data, even Netflix in terms of competition, but in terms of real serious problems, three of the FANGs are still -potentially got big issues.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And in particular, Facebook. I think we can almost kind of put Facebook to one side a little bit because even though it is unclear what Congress is going to do to regulate them, they do have the European all coming down that is absolutely going to happen on May 25th there, General Data Protection Regulation and that is going to impact Facebook's business.</p><p>But I think, you know, Netflix was at a record high today. The rest of them are pretty much just back where they were at the end of March when we started to see those four, so all of it is going to start to get some context.</p><p>QUEST: Clare, good to see you. Thank you. We will talk more about this. We will talk more about technology in a moment.</p><p>After the break, with me, Brad Smith is the President of Microsoft and there he is, waiting out on the West. We are going to talk about the new deal. The new agreement between various tech companies, right after the break.</p><p>QUEST: I'm Richard Quest, there of course, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. When the NTSB says one person has died after Southwest Airlines jet suffered a catastrophic engine failure at 30,000 feet.</p><p>And I'll speak to the IMF's chief economist who sound the alarm on what protectionist is in the global economy. And you and I continue tonight, this is Cnn, and here on this network we guarantee you the facts always come first.</p><p>Right now, Japan's Prime Minister is talking about trade in North Korea, but President Trump enjoyed it. Shinzo Abe is also calling for complete and verifiable nuclear denuclearization, and he commended Mr. Trump for agreeing to hold talks with North Korea's leader.</p><p>The U.S. president says he expects something to happen by early June at one of five possible sites. There are conflicting reports about the chemical weapons experts have entered the Syrian city of Duma.</p><p>Syrian state television and the white helmet volunteer rescue groups saying they have, U.S. State Department says they haven't. The team is to access where the banned substances were used and expected clinical attack 10 days ago.</p><p>Theresa May; the British Prime Minister has apologized to generations of British-Caribbean immigrants who have been denied government service, jobs and homes and even threatened with deportation.</p><p>She said it's the Windrush scandal at a meeting with Caribbean leaders on Tuesday. The prime minister vowed to give more support to the immigrants and insisted they are still welcome in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Microsoft just built a coalition with some of the biggest names in tech to make a stand against cyber warfare. Companies like Facebook, Cisco and Telefonika are all part of a new accord vowing not to help government carry out cyber attacks.</p><p>And say they will come to their users aid when they're victims of an attack or a hack. Microsoft's President Brad Smith joins me from San Francisco. Always good to have you on our program. Brad, thank you for taking the time.</p><p>Brad, the accord, the agreement and I -- I mean, how difficult was it to get everyone to sign up, and bearing in mind Amazon and Google haven't.</p><p>BRADFORD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT: Well, I think this is one very important step forward. We brought together 34 companies from around the world and across the industry. And I am confident that more companies would join in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>[16:35:00] We need to take a stand, and the stand we're taking is that we'll protect customers around the world, we'll work together to increase the resilience and ability to defend customers.</p><p>Then we're also saying that we won't help governments launch cyber attacks against innocent citizens or enterprises. I think that's --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SMITH: Exactly what the world needs.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so is the -- is this the albeit an official non-governmental digital Geneva Convention or at least the start of it that you have been seeking?</p><p>SMITH: It is the start of precisely that, I believe. We knew in my view that we needed to have the tech sectors step forward first. It's easier to bring companies together from around the world and governments from around the world.</p><p>But we now need to build on this and really continue to call on governments to stop attacking --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>SMITH: Citizens the way we've seen.</p><p>QUEST: OK, it's all in the definitions here though. You know, you say attacking innocent citizens. I mean, if the U.S. government as some suspect is engaged in its own version of cyber warfare or the collection of difficult privacy information, you are basically saying you will go against the U.S. government or the British government or the Australian government or whoever it is.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I actually think if you look at the world today, the biggest attacks against probably even citizens are clearly coming from a set of governments that we know well.</p><p>It was North Korea and a group associated with it that launched a one attack last year. It affected hospitals across the United Kingdom and affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries.</p><p>We saw that now Turkey attack launched against the country of Ukraine, those are the big problems that we need to solve. We're principle vis-a- vis every government, but there's no doubt who the biggest culprits are today.</p><p>QUEST: And would have thought also -- I mean, when you say we will oppose cyber attacks on the innocent citizens, we will protect against tampering with exploitation of technology.</p><p>We will not help governments launch cyber attacks and we will protect customers using -- I suppose someone would say, well, I thought you were doing that anyway?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think that in many ways most of us have --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SMITH: But we need to bring together the industry on a global basis.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so --</p><p>SMITH: Because -- yes --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, right. How do you -- let me just be cynical or skeptical. I'll let you decide after you've heard the question. How do I not take the decision -- just a very nice document with good sounding words, but actually has no realties behind it and the companies we'll all ignore it whether it suits their book anyway.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think it's a fair question, Richard, and I think that as with all such things, one needs to start with words. Because we use words to define principles. But ultimately, we all need to be judged by our deeds.</p><p>Now that we put the words down on paper, we need to live up to them and we need to take concrete steps to implement them, and that's what we're bringing together, others to do, that's why we're partnering with other companies to do.</p><p>But it's more than fair for you and others to judge us by what we do in the months and years ahead.</p><p>QUEST: Brad, I'm going to go out to the frolic of my own here and ask you -- you would have seen today Starbucks has announced it's closing 8,000 of its stores for one day for racial bias training.</p><p>And this is the sort of moral leadership that companies lead, isn't it? I mean, you know, one could argue about the event that happened in Philadelphia, but it's how companies respond to crisis that's important. Would you agree?</p><p>SMITH: I do agree with that, and you know, Kevin Johnson; the CEO of Starbucks is somebody who worked at Microsoft with us closely for many years, in the world today, we all have our difficult days.</p><p>And as you put it quite rightly, it's how we respond to those difficult days that are the tests of our times. I'm not an expert on Starbucks issues, but I do believe that there are all days when we have to stand up for principles.</p><p>And among those principles is the importance of respect for other people and a world that honors diversity and inclusion. And do you think that is getting more difficult in an era where social media social discourse, even presidential discourse has become so difficult, so toxic that maintaining integrity has become much trickier?</p><p>SMITH: I think it's a challenging time, I think you're right to frame it as a difficult time. I think it's a time that requires the leaders, whether they'd be in business or anywhere else.</p><p>Really understand the principles for which they want to stand up and they have the courage of their convictions. And there are days when -- you know, people will disagree they have the right to.</p><p>But I do think that people ultimately respect those who have the courage of their convictions and are clear in taking principled stands.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST: Well, you said you've taken a principled stand, so with this document, I will be watching closely in the days, weeks, months and years ahead to see as I suspect, you expect.</p><p>SMITH: I would expect nothing less, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Brad, as always, thank you for taking time to join us --</p><p>SMITH: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Tonight. When we come back, pretty horrific, horrifying, cared for(ph). A Southwest plane has an engine failure that punches the fabric -- that punches the fuselage and the person is killed after being nearly sucked out of the aircraft. After the break, we'll tell you more about it.</p><p>QUEST: For anybody who flies, it's a nightmare scenario. A person is dead after an accident on a Southwest flight from New York to Dallas, forcing an emergency landing because of an explosive decompression after the result of an engine exploding.</p><p>An NTSB team is currently on its way to Philadelphia. So this is what we know, all believe the facts are. The left wing number one engine as you see here appear to explode, and then part of its fractured or entered the cabin, blowing out one of the windows here which is you can see.</p><p>Now since the plane was in altitude, they caused an explosive decompression we believe a passenger was almost sucked out of the aircraft before being pulled back in again.</p><p>Over the last hour, the NTSB chairman said incidents like this are extremely unusual.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: Engine failure. How frequent does the NTSB see what we technically do qualify as a non-contained engine failure.</p><p>I may ask that that is about three or four a year, and not all of those involve U.S. carriers. In last Fall, there was a A380 that had an uncontained engine failure over Greenland and was not a U.S. carrier.</p><p>So we see about three or four of those a year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Peter Goelz is the former managing director of the NTSB, joins me from Washington. What's your understanding of what happened here particularly in the face of a first someone who died.</p><p>PETER GOELZ, FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: Well, I mean, the NTSB is going to treat this as a major investigation. We don't know what happened.</p><p>I mean, the obvious culprit is the internal workings of the engine. The reality is the CFM engine is a real work horse. You know, it doesn't need to be overhauled for 50,000 hours.</p><p>But something let loose or something came off that caused that engine to disintegrate and penetrate the cabin. And it's -- we will find out shortly.</p><p>QUEST: Of course Southwest had a very similar incident just a couple of years ago, where also number one engine penetrated the fuselage, on that occasion nobody was injured.</p><p>But it's going to raise questions on the CFM snuck-around engines.</p><p>GOELZ: Yes it will and it will raise questions about where they're maintained, how they're maintained. They will look at the manufacturing of the individual blades, if it was a blade that failed.</p><p>[16:45:00] You know, there are microscopic fatigue crash that can sometimes go unexamined and can, you know, develop into a catastrophe.</p><p>QUEST: If we look at the major incidents of this, and let us do the recent ones. I mean, you've got the BA at Las Vegas --</p><p>GOELZ: Right --</p><p>QUEST: The 777, you've got the American 76, and you have Qantas, the 32. They all have massive engine failures where the nacelle doesn't contain the debris. Is this something that needs to be examined.</p><p>GOELZ: Well, I think it does, I mean, the old theory or the current working knowledge is that the cowling and the nacelle has to be able to, you know, contain an engine disintegration.</p><p>You know, there's got to a major --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GOELZ: Titanium, if they're not being able to do that because of the brake efficiency and the high power nature of these engines, then they're going to have to revisit that -- their requirement.</p><p>QUEST: Do you see any urgent or immediate NTSB action in this regard?</p><p>GOELZ: Well, I think they're going to look very carefully if they've got at the fan blades and at the compressors. If they see something, they will --</p><p>QUEST: Great --</p><p>GOELZ: Not hesitate.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, Peter, there's an inevitability that once -- you'll be familiar with the phrase here, the liberated parts. And once the liberated part are ejected from the engine, there's almost an inevitability because of the proximity that the fuselage and the passengers become a risk.</p><p>Certainly, you saw that even more so with the old days of the delta in 1996 where you had the engine nine which went -- which blew at the back.</p><p>GOELZ: Right, I was on scene for that accident and it was just dreadful. And you know, those engines are nacelle-up next to the fuselage and that is a real challenge.</p><p>QUEST: Peter, thank you, good to see you sir, come back and help us understand it when we get some reports from the NTSB. Which grade would you --</p><p>GOELZ: I will, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thanks with you. We continue tonight, China is taking a twin-track approach to its trade standoff with the United States. We're really looking at Beijing's strategy after the break.</p><p>And of course, the chief economist at the IMF who says protectionism could strangle global growth.</p><p>QUEST: When it comes to responding to threats about trade, China is deploying both the carat(ph) and the stick(ph). Here's the carat(ph), it is the restrictions imposed on non-Chinese car makers to be removed by -- not 2022, from 2022.</p><p>[16:50:00] Until now, they had to share factory ownership and profits with Chinese companies. The sort of JV arrangement. And this is the restrictions, easier access, bad tariffs to be originated. Now, from Wednesday, Beijing says it will apply 117 percent tariffs on U.S. sorghum imports.</p><p>Washington this week banned U.S. suppliers from selling parts of software to ZTE; a major Chinese tech company because of sanctions busting. The shares were suspended in Hong Kong.</p><p>And the Treasury Secretary on Monday tweeted by the president on currencies saying that that tweet was a warning shot. Donald Trump accuse China of devaluing its currency.</p><p>In his new world economic -- out of the will, the IMF says protectionism is a major risk to the global economy. Earlier on, press expressed the firm's chief economist said countries need to be cautious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAURICE OBSTFELD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, IMF: Of course, and we should remember that trade is to their mutual benefit, it's been a driver of growth through the entire post-war period.</p><p>So you know, we do worry that there could be escalation with measures and counter measures. We hope that countries will instead collaborate in a multilateral spirit and resolve their differences.</p><p>QUEST: At the moment, the environment is pretty good as you say, U.S. is growing faster now, employment, low unemployment, low inflation but rising interest rates.</p><p>Are you worried about the speed at which these rates are going up in the U.S.?</p><p>OBSTFELD: You know, the U.S. is embarking on a historically large fiscal expansion at a time when it's at full employment. And our projections call for U.S. unemployment rate to fall to levels that we haven't seen since the late 1960s.</p><p>That could pose inflation risks and the Fed would meet those by raising interest rates perhaps more times than it's currently foreseeing. So yes, we do worry that there could be a spike in the interest rates and that would not only be a U.S. issue, it would affect dollar debts worldwide.</p><p>It affects capital flows to emerging markets.</p><p>QUEST: The president of the United States criticized Russia and China yesterday for what he says was currency devaluations. But he's wrong, isn't he? There should be no managed devaluation of those currencies if anything in the case of China, quite the opposite.</p><p>OBSTFELD: You know, well, China has spent about a trillion dollars in reserves, not recently but certainly in 2015 and 2016, preventing its currency from depreciating.</p><p>You know, we judge that, it might have to appreciate a bit in the future to keep the current account in line, but it's not grossly undervalued. Russia has a floating exchange rate and it has depreciated a lot recently.</p><p>But part of the reason for that has been the new sanctions on Russia.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk finally, Maurice, as you look across the world and you see the various factors, whether it's Brexit, higher interest rates in the U.S., sanctions on Russia, China trade. What is the one thing at the moment that you would urge I should keep my eye on?</p><p>OBSTFELD: Well, I think we should look on debts worldwide and our fiscal monitor which comes out tomorrow will talk about that. Whether you look at sovereign debts, corporate debts, household debts, they're historically high.</p><p>And as interest rates go up, as Central Banks normalize monetary policies, there's uncertainty about what the prospects will be. That's why we recommend that governments in particular reduce those debts so that they have some ammunition when the next recession comes.</p><p>And as good as things are now, we know there will be another recession some day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: That we can be sure, another recession someday. A sober warning from Maurice Obstfeld. The Dow climbed more than 200 points on Tuesday after a number of better-than-expected earnings.</p><p>Shares have -- putting up 11 percent, and the interesting thing about that it was only after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendations on the stock and said user growth was picking up, IBM shares are down 5 percent, down for us, United Airlines is up 3 percent.</p><p>Both reported earnings in this hour. I'll look at quickly the European bosses, the Euro bosses, Dax at its best level since February. To get an idea of the markets, a strong day across the board with the Dax having -- up 1.5 percent and the New York markets up strongly as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] We will take a profitable moment after a short break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, Starbucks have shown us exactly how a crisis is supposed to be handled after two men were arrested for not buying anything and then thrown out of the store, I call this year's crisis that hit Starbucks.</p><p>But the way the company responded first of all immediately, the CEO apologized. Said it was reprehensible, should not have happened, it was wrong. Has held a meeting with the men who were arrested to apologize again and started training on unconscious bias.</p><p>And now finally closing the whole Starbucks network of 8,000 stores in the United States, a one day of training. Now of course, a one day training isn't going to be necessarily enough, but the fact Starbucks has shown such leadership on such a tricky, difficult issue, it speaks volumes for the way the company is actually following its own principles.</p><p>Compare that to United Airlines or to Facebook or to Equifax and how when they had their crisis, they had to blame somebody else, disappeared off into the distance, weren't seen and the apology came to you too little and too late.</p><p>No, Starbucks has proven exactly why it is so successful because it does what it says it will do. When things go wrong, it puts them right. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.

It's something that should have been  taken care of, years ago, decades ago.  It's at a point now where we don't  really have a choice.  This must be taken care of one way or the other.  </p><p>I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un and hopefully, that will be a  success, and maybe it will be, and maybe it won't be, we don't know, but we  will see what happens.  But I can say this, they do respect this.  We are  respectful of them and we are going to see what happens.  We will bring up  the abduct case.  We will bring up many different things.  I think it's a  time to talk and it's a time for solving problems.  </p><p>I know that's been a very big factor to you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).  </p><p>TRUMP:  South Korea's meetings with North Korea are very much in  coordination with us, and in consultation with them constantly.  Our  relationship with South Korea is a very good one.  In fact, we are in the  midst of negotiating a new and better, perhaps for both sides, straight  deal.  Right now, it's an unfair deal frankly to the United States, but  what else is new?  All of them are.  </p><p>But we are going to finalize a new deal fairly soon.  We probably could  have them already.  I want to have it done, but we are in very close  communication and coordination with South Korea with their upcoming  meetings and even encouraged talks with North Korea and as I said before,  the war has never ended.  If we could do something even before the meeting,  these big plans of meeting, that would be fine, but we are dealing very  closely with South Korea.  </p><p>They are the ones that came and told us about the original meeting that  they want to meet with me.  They want to meet with the United States  specifically.  We have not picked the site yet, but we picked five sites  where it's potentially going to be.  We'll let you know fairly soon and we  will see what happens.  </p><p>We'll either have a very good meeting or we won't have a good meeting and  maybe we won't even have a meeting at all depending on what's going in, but  I think that there is a great chance to solve a world problem.  This is not  a problem for the United States...  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>TRUMP:  ... it's not a problem for Japan or any other country, it's a  problem for the world.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Foreign language).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Donald Trump there where  President Trump with the Japanese Prime Minister with some very interesting  comments about North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un.  No rocket man  references, instead called him by name, said we respect them, they respect  us.  Talked about the potential for the meeting with Kim in which he said  he thought it would be successful.  He hopes it will be, but it might not  be.  </p><p>But he said that they would hold a meeting if that was to take place, he  was looking forward to it.  And on the question of South Korea, again,  talking about the trade deal that he hopes, and now, just on the deals in  terms of North Korea and the various bilateral talks taking place.  </p><p>While we monitor, we will move on.  A very good evening to you and this is  \"Quest Means Business\" where tonight Starbucks has announced dramatic  action to address the discrimination scandal.  </p><p>Starbucks is to close its 8,000 US coffee stores in the afternoon on May  29th to educate its employees about racial bias.  And the reason of course,  following on from the uproar over this arrest of two black men at a  Starbucks in Philadelphia.  </p><p>The men were doing nothing, literally.  They were waiting for a friend  before ordering.  After they were refused permission to use the restroom,  the store managers called the police, the men were arrested for  trespassing.  </p><p>Protest and criticism followed.  The Chief Executive, Kevin Johnson has  promised the company will learn lessons.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS:  I want to apologize to the community in  Philadelphia and to all my Starbucks partners.  This is not who we are and  it is not who we are going to be.  </p><p>We are going to learn from this and we will be better forward.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, Starbucks is now actually putting its actions where its words  are, or where the CEO's words are.  Let's remind ourselves what Starbucks's  values, mission and statement actually says.  It says, \"Our values with our  priorities are...\" basically, so far, I can't even read it.  What does that  actually say.  </p><p>It says, \"Our values to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person,  one cup, one neighborhood at a time.  With our partners, we will fill these  values.  Creating a culture of warmth, belonging where everyone is  welcome.\"  And importantly at the end, \"Holding ourselves accountable to  results.\"  </p><p>Joining me now, Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia and a CNN  contributor, Rashad Robinson is the executive director at Color of Change,  also on the Board of Demos, one of the organizations Starbucks is  consulting with over its awareness.  They are both in Atlanta for us  tonight.  </p><p>Mr. Mayor, first with you, are you content now that Starbucks has done  sufficient?  </p><p>MICHAEL NUTTER, FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA:  Well, Richard, let me first  say, this is unprecedented.  It is bold.  It is certainly dynamic.  CEO,  Kevin Johnson, Chief Operating Officer, Rosalind Brewer and even Board  Chairman, Howard Schultz, all on the ground in Philadelphia demonstrating  an understanding and a sensitivity after the terrible tragedy and incident  in Philadelphia.  </p><p>But, taking as you pointed out, taking unprecedented action to try to  address some of the elements here.  They've put a lot of stuff out there.   They already have many activities going on in Philadelphia and across the  country, so you know, they are making steps.  </p><p>QUEST:  No, but that's not what I asked, sir.  I mean, they are making  steps, but is it sufficient?  I mean, at this stage in the process what  they have done?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Well, I think they've done a lot since, I guess this all happened  last Thursday and kind of blew up over the weekend.  I am not sure in two  or three days how much more you can do, again, Richard, I don't know of any  CEO, I don't know him, but I don't know of any CEO who has ever gone to a  city when some incident happened.  </p><p>QUEST:  Got it.  </p><p>NUTTER:  And literally looked somebody in the eye and apologized to him.  </p><p>QUEST:  Rashad, if this was a textbook, it would be a textbook case on how  to handle a crisis, any company is going to have miscreant behavior,  negligent behavior, malicious behavior, any company the size of Starbucks.   It's not what happens, it's what you do about it, surely.  </p><p>RASHAD ROBINSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COLOR OF CHANGE:  Absolutely, and  Starbucks a real opportunity to lead here.  The issue will be, it's not  just the input, but what actually comes out of it.  Do we see real results?   Across social media, across our membership at Color of Change, we are  hearing from people who have had their incidents...  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>ROBINSON:  ... at Starbucks.  I have been in touch with the leadership at  Starbucks and know that they are hearing and they are trying to move  forward.  But this is not a conversation about one bad store or one bad  apple or even one bad corporation that has had a challenge here in  Starbucks.  </p><p>Starbucks has an opportunity to really lead, but there is a whole community  and folks that are at play here.  </p><p>QUEST:  But, Rashad, you say it has an opportunity to lead.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  But why do you say it has an opportunity?  Surely, it is leading.   I mean, are you not giving -- I mean, the mayor gives some credit for what  they are doing in the short period of time.  Do you give them the same  credit for what they are doing?  </p><p>ROBINSON:  I absolutely give them credit for what they have done in the  short period of time, and what I have to say as someone who is -- like the  mayor, been in this work for a number of years is that we will look back on  this time a year from now, two years from now, three years from now and see  actually, did these actions lead to the type of results, the type of  changes, real world changes in to people's lives.  </p><p>QUEST:  Mr. Mayor, arguably, you know, corporations will follow because  where profits go, and then people boycott therefore, but the police in all  of this.  Now, there is a real role surely, Mr. Mayor to be answered about  why the police -- obviously, they asked the men to leave, and obviously,  you know, at some point they realized there was no other way to handle this  than to arrest them.  </p><p>Surely, the police needs to be looking at their own actions in this.  </p><p>NUTTER:  And I believe, Police Commissioner Ross will continue that kind of  work, but again, Richard, we go back to the beginning.  The police should  never have been called in the first place.  That was the first error.  </p><p>And I said last night, you know, police officers do have some amount of  discretion.  You know, if you go through a red light, every person does not  get a traffic ticket when that happens.  Officers take a lot of factors  into consideration.  </p><p>This one, it seems the officers went into a little bit of a rock and a hard  place.  They've got a store manager saying, \"These people are trespassing,  we don't want them in the store anymore.\"  They have been called, you know,  maybe different officers, maybe a different decision.  Supervisors et  cetera, et cetera.  But I believe that Police Commissioner Ross and the  folks over at the Philadelphia Police Department will also reexamine their  own actions in this particular (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Actually, actually, this is where I have to disagree with the  Mayor respectfully.  Absolutely, the first thing that the Police Chief came  out and said was that the police officers did nothing wrong, but he was  going to do an investigation.  </p><p>This -- over and over again, in cities around the country, in communities  around the country, police cannot police themselves.  We have  (inaudible)...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  Hang on, hang on, Rashad.  Hang on, hang on.  On the point that  you've just raised, all right, what in your view should the police have  done, faced with a Catch 22 that the Mayor talks about.  </p><p>Starbucks doesn't want them there.  The original error has been made the  police have been called, but now they are faced with a situation where  somebody is refusing a lawful police instruction to leave the property.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  Yes, I mean, the question is why was there that police  instruction in the first place?  The conversation between the manager about  why they were supposed to leave, then the conversation with the other  patrons about whether or not they were causing a problem.  Whether or not  the police instruction was fair in the first place, whether or not that  police instruction would have happened if those folks were white, would  have happened.  </p><p>The fact of the matter is that there is a different type of standards and  laws if you are black in America versus if you are white and for a police  department which has a fraternal order of police, which not only endorsed  Donald Trump, but stands behind him even after Charlottesville, this police  department does not get the benefit of the doubt in black communities and  they need to be held accountable and political leaders cannot enable them.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, gentlemen, I do need to end it there, gentlemen...  </p><p>NUTTER:  We don't want to let the actions of a few tarnish the brave men  and women of the Philadelphia Police Department.  </p><p>ROBINSON:  This is not a conversation about bad apples.  This is a  conversation about structural policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  Gentlemen, gentlemen, there's a reason why I have a bell on this  desk and it is to say, gentlemen, thank you both very much for joining in  our discussion tonight.  </p><p>Now, to something that is really quite extraordinary.  Let me put it like  this.  If the current situation in Washington with the President was a  movie, with all of its various actors and participants, you would say, it's  too far-fetched.  If it was a book, you'd say it is not believable.  It  simply couldn't happen, and yet, we have a cast of characters at the summit  of America's government.  </p><p>Imagine it's a movie trailer.  No disrespect, but imagine you're watching a  movie trailer.  You have the President, a billionaire businessman and  former TV reality star who faces numerous allegations of sexual  misconducts, who is rejecting accusation...  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  ... of an affair with the porn actress, Stormy Daniels who is paid  with $130,000.00 to stay silent, by none other by the President's lawyer,  Michael Cohen, the fixer whose office is then searched by the FBI looking  for evidence of campaign collusions with Russians and in a courtroom drama  moment, discovers an undisclosed client who is revealed to be the star  presenter of Fox News, Sean Hannity, who happens to be a close friend of  the President and his most vocal supporter, the host.  </p><p>All the while as this maelstrom continues, a former, deep insider reveals  all.  James Comey, the Director of the FBI fired by the President who is  having the alleged affair with the porn actress who was with the lawyer who  was paid off at the same time.  </p><p>And now, takes revenge by describing the Commander-in-Chief as morally  unfit.  If you read this or saw it in a movie, you would not believe it.  </p><p>David Gergen, you would say this is incredulous, this couldn't happen.   Checks and balances.  You couldn't have this sort of behavior.  Somebody  would find out.  Which bit of this do you find the most distressing?  </p><p>DAVID GERGEN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, CNN:  Well, it certainly is going  to put a lot of novelists out of business -- that is never as should.  I  think what I find the most puzzling is the degree which there seems to be a  web or network of individuals now who are one reason or another under  investigation or in trouble with the law.  </p><p>And that we've never seen before.  I worked in the Nixon White House as a  young guy.  I can tell you in one case, we had a sort of a sole person in  the President himself who was pulling people towards him to commit criminal  acts, but there was no web.  </p><p>And so, I found it when James Comey and his book and his interviews have  been saying his first reaction upon encountering the Trump team was that,  it was like, the days when he was working against the mob and prosecuting  members of a mob.  And that there was a sort of sense of belonging to a  group, a filth he demanded of the leader if you would, and a real sense of  we're a brotherhood, we have our standards.  Nobody else in the country may  understand our standards or agree with him, but we're here and we're in  charge.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, all right, in that scenario and take for example today, the  President tweets that Comey should be in jail.  Comey, the former head of  the FBI tweets, \"We must never accept that this is normal.  It's not normal  for the President of the United States to say people should be locked up,\"  as he did once of course about Hillary Clinton.  What do you make of it?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Well, I think Comey is right.  I mean, this has become a mud fight  and Comey says some things that are I think, have given offense to others.   But I must say, this President for whatever reason seems to take lightly  the whole idea that when you are elected President of the United States,  you can punish your enemies by putting them in jail.  </p><p>You know, from the campaign on, he saying, remember, \"Lock her up.  Lock  her up.\" A chant in a lot of Trump rallies that Michael Flynn encouraged  that chant, and you know, right here now, the President saying Comey ought  to be put in jail.  That's what you see in a Banana Republic, you know,  that if you win the election, you put the other side in jail.  That's the  way you deal with it.  </p><p>Frankly, you see it in autocratic countries and the authoritarian countries  where you put your enemies in jail.  </p><p>QUEST:  Okay, so yesterday you would have read the \"New York Times\" four- page editorial against the actions of say the President and of course the  Republican leadership, which leads me to ask with great respect, how  worried are you for the system?  How worried are you that real damage is  being done to the fabric of the Constitutional system which will take years  if it can't be repaired?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Well, I think it is doing damage not only internally in the United  States, but hurting our reputation overseas.  We pride ourselves of being a  model, if you would, with the rule of law and respect for the rule of law  and what I am worried about now is, here internally in the United States is  not so much about the checks and balances.  Those are still operating just  as they did down in Watergate and Watergate with the Congress and the press  and others, but especially the press and the court being very tough on the  administration.  </p><p>But what is very, I think distressing and dangerous here, Richard is not  the checks and balances.  It is whether we maintain the traditions, the  norms as they...  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>GERGEN:  ... are called, which helped to create a civilized nation so that  people have certain expectations that others will be truthful, that they  will be -- that there will be transparency, there will be accountability  and all of those things are being sort of kicked aside and I do worry that  this becomes a way of life, you know.  </p><p>You've got a President who lies or misleads you five times a day as some of  the data suggests, you know, what is that teaching our kids about how to  behave as adults?  </p><p>QUEST:  David, thank you, sir.  </p><p>GERGEN:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>QUEST:  Who knows what the next chapter or the next sequel in this story  will be?  </p><p>GERGEN:  Always spinning.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, good to see you, David Gergen joining me from  Washington.  We will take a break.  We'll have the markets afterwards, and  if you think it's all too far-fetched, just look at the chart and wonder  what comes next?  </p><p>By this time tomorrow, the curtain will have risen on Saudi Arabia's first  cinema in over three decades.  The AMC Complex will open in the capital,  Riyadh after a 35-year ban on movie theaters which lifted in December.   Adam Aaron is AMC's Chief Executive Officer, CEO and joins me now live.  </p><p>The cold question or the first question is, what will you be showing when  the movies begin tomorrow night?  </p><p>ADAM AARON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMC ENTERTAINMENT:  Well, there has  been a lot of press about that and we have not confirmed the story, but  since you broke the story way back in November, we're going to confirm it  here with you, we are showing \"Black Panther,\" the third most successful  movie of all time in the United States, and it will air about 19 hours from  now in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as you said, a historic day, the first time in  35 years that cinemas have functioned in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>QUEST:  You've gone for a winner there, Adam.  You've gone for an absolute  winner.  Nothing like getting them in for that one.  All right, so listen,  when this opens, what are the ground rules that you will be operating under  and I say ground rules, but you know what I mean.  What is your  understanding of what you will show and what you will not show?  </p><p>AARON:  Well, we are going to show typical Hollywood blockbusters that are  very popular in the United States and in Europe and elsewhere in the world.   You know, Hollywood has been showing movies in the Middle East for a long  time.  It has proven that it could be sensitive to the local cultures here  in the region and we are very confident that the big movies in the United  States are going to be big movies in Saudi too.  </p><p>QUEST:  How significant is the Saudi market going to be for you?  I mean,  you are well and truly a head of the pack here, and you know, you're  obviously starting to mount on your competitors?  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>AARON:  Well, we certainly are way out front in Saudi Arabia at AMC.  We  have been at this now for -- since September.  We have met with the highest  levels of government.  I had the great privilege to meet, His Royal  Highness, the Crown Prince and hear from him directly how important it was  to reopen cinemas four decades in and here we are, we have an agreement  with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Saudi Arabia who is our partner here.  We  could not possibly have a better partner.  </p><p>It's our goal to open about half of all the movie theaters that opened in  this country over the next decade and as you said, we've got the first  license to operate.  We got the first license to open a cinema and we open  tomorrow night.  April 18 is going to be a historic day for the movie  industry in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>QUEST:  Adam, great to see you.  Thank you for revealing \"Black Panther\"  and you and I -- we still have got to go to the movies at some point  together so I can actually see how the owner of the movie theater, what  sort of seat he actually gets.  It's probably near the back because it's --  good to see you, sir.  </p><p>AARON:  Well, the seats he gets are the seats everyone else gets which is  nice, luxury, reclining seats, very comfortable and your choice.  Your  choice, we will do it in New York, London or now, in Riyadh.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'll buy the popcorn, you buy the colas.  Thank you, good to see  you, Adam.  </p><p>Now, investors are cheering results from America's biggest companies.   Well, we're in the earning season and our spiral share case is starting to  fill in as we track the share prices in the 24 hours.  </p><p>This is Clare.  So, Clare you stay where you are.  We will be back with you  in just a moment to put some things -- this is the true barometer of what  Wall Street thinks about the quarter gone by.  How the share price moves in  the 24 hours after results.  </p><p>Never mind the first few moments.  We will have United and IBM, they are  reporting this hour -- United Airlines.  Bank shares have remained  stubbornly down, all of them would be down and indeed we saw that today.  </p><p>If we take Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs have results which were very good  at 27 percent despite a $2.8 billion profit.  The stock has closed down 1.6  percent about sustainability of their profit, all of the banks -- Citi,  Goldman, Wells Fargo, PNC -- they've all been down, Bank of America inching  it out.  </p><p>As for Netflix, well, I told you yesterday, we talked about their results,  but now, Netflix finished up 9 percent with another 9 percent, so it's  roughly about there, which is where it would be.  Strong subscriber growth  is what is moving Netflix.  </p><p>You are seeing this sort of, at the moment, the banks have weighed the  share case down towards the lower end, but now, I expect it will start to  move up towards the higher end.  </p><p>As for the FANGS -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google -- all gained  ground during the course of the day with Facebook up 2 percent, Amazon up 4  percent, Google was up 3 percent.  That's the way it looks.  </p><p>So, Clare Sebastian has been looking at the numbers first and joining us on  the FANGs.  Why are FANGs back in stock?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Netflix.  </p><p>QUEST:  Including Netflix?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Well, this is a kind of a media pent up, you know, buying  session based on the fact that Netflix was the first of the big tech  companies, the first of the FANG to be reporting.  They were really waiting  for this moment.  It is -- although, it is a bit smaller in terms of market  cap, and it has a different kind of business model, it is still kind of a  bell weather or barometer of how the rest are going to go.  </p><p>And I think that's what led everyone to pile in.  They were waiting for an  excuse, Richard to trade on the fundamentals rather than the kind of  regulatory noise, the Trump tweets around Amazon.  All of that we were  looking at last week.  </p><p>QUEST:  But, hang on, hang on.  They still have regulatory problems...  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  ... and issues.  Amazon still hasn't dealt with its issues.   They've got issues in terms of privacy and data, even Netflix in terms of  competition, but in terms of real serious problems, three of the FANGs are  still -potentially got big issues.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  And in particular, Facebook.  I think we can almost kind of put  Facebook to one side a little bit because even though it is unclear what  Congress is going to do to regulate them, they do have the European all  coming down that is absolutely going to happen on May 25th there, General  Data Protection Regulation and that is going to impact Facebook's business.  </p><p>But I think, you know, Netflix was at a record high today.  The rest of  them are pretty much just back where they were at the end of March when we  started to see those four, so all of it is going to start to get some  context.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare, good to see you.  Thank you.  We will talk more about this.   We will talk more about technology in a moment.  </p><p>After the break, with me, Brad Smith is the President of Microsoft and  there he is, waiting out on the West.  We are going to talk about the new  deal.  The new agreement between various tech companies, right after the  break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  I'm Richard Quest, there of course, there's a lot more QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS in just a moment.  When the NTSB says one person has died after  Southwest Airlines jet suffered a catastrophic engine failure at 30,000  feet. </p><p>And I'll speak to the IMF's chief economist who sound the alarm on what  protectionist is in the global economy.  And you and I continue tonight,  this is Cnn, and here on this network we guarantee you the facts always  come first.</p><p>Right now, Japan's Prime Minister is talking about trade in North Korea,  but President Trump enjoyed it.  Shinzo Abe is also calling for complete  and verifiable nuclear denuclearization, and he commended Mr. Trump for  agreeing to hold talks with North Korea's leader.</p><p>The U.S. president says he expects something to happen by early June at one  of five possible sites.  There are conflicting reports about the chemical  weapons experts have entered the Syrian city of Duma.</p><p>Syrian state television and the white helmet volunteer rescue groups saying  they have, U.S. State Department says they haven't.  The team is to access  where the banned substances were used and expected clinical attack 10 days  ago.</p><p>Theresa May; the British Prime Minister has apologized to generations of  British-Caribbean immigrants who have been denied government service, jobs  and homes and even threatened with deportation.</p><p>She said it's the Windrush scandal at a meeting with Caribbean leaders on  Tuesday.  The prime minister vowed to give more support to the immigrants  and insisted they are still welcome in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Microsoft just built a coalition with some of the biggest names in tech to  make a stand against cyber warfare.  Companies like Facebook, Cisco and  Telefonika are all part of a new accord vowing not to help government carry  out cyber attacks.</p><p>And say they will come to their users aid when they're victims of an attack  or a hack.  Microsoft's President Brad Smith joins me from San Francisco.   Always good to have you on our program.  Brad, thank you for taking the  time.</p><p>Brad, the accord, the agreement and I -- I mean, how difficult was it to  get everyone to sign up, and bearing in mind Amazon and Google haven't.</p><p>BRADFORD SMITH, PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT:  Well, I think this is one very  important step forward.  We brought together 34 companies from around the  world and across the industry.  And I am confident that more companies  would join in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>[16:35:00] We need to take a stand, and the stand we're taking is that  we'll protect customers around the world, we'll work together to increase  the resilience and ability to defend customers.</p><p>Then we're also saying that we won't help governments launch cyber attacks  against innocent citizens or enterprises.  I think that's -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SMITH:  Exactly what the world needs.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so is the -- is this the albeit an official non-governmental  digital Geneva Convention or at least the start of it that you have been  seeking?</p><p>SMITH:  It is the start of precisely that, I believe.  We knew in my view  that we needed to have the tech sectors step forward first.  It's easier to  bring companies together from around the world and governments from around  the world.</p><p>But we now need to build on this and really continue to call on governments  to stop attacking -- </p><p>QUEST:  But -- </p><p>SMITH:  Citizens the way we've seen.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, it's all in the definitions here though.  You know, you say  attacking innocent citizens.  I mean, if the U.S. government as some  suspect is engaged in its own version of cyber warfare or the collection of  difficult privacy information, you are basically saying you will go against  the U.S. government or the British government or the Australian government  or whoever it is.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I actually think if you look at the world today, the biggest  attacks against probably even citizens are clearly coming from a set of  governments that we know well. </p><p>It was North Korea and a group associated with it that launched a one  attack last year.  It affected hospitals across the United Kingdom and  affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries.</p><p>We saw that now Turkey attack launched against the country of Ukraine,  those are the big problems that we need to solve.  We're principle vis-a- vis every government, but there's no doubt who the biggest culprits are  today. </p><p>QUEST:  And would have thought also -- I mean, when you say we will oppose  cyber attacks on the innocent citizens, we will protect against tampering  with exploitation of technology.</p><p>We will not help governments launch cyber attacks and we will protect  customers using -- I suppose someone would say, well, I thought you were  doing that anyway?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think that in many ways most of us have -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>SMITH:  But we need to bring together the industry on a global basis.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so -- </p><p>SMITH:  Because -- yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, right.  How do you -- let me just be cynical or skeptical.   I'll let you decide after you've heard the question.  How do I not take the  decision -- just a very nice document with good sounding words, but  actually has no realties behind it and the companies we'll all ignore it  whether it suits their book anyway.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think it's a fair question, Richard, and I think that as  with all such things, one needs to start with words.  Because we use words  to define principles.  But ultimately, we all need to be judged by our  deeds.</p><p>Now that we put the words down on paper, we need to live up to them and we  need to take concrete steps to implement them, and that's what we're  bringing together, others to do, that's why we're partnering with other  companies to do.</p><p>But it's more than fair for you and others to judge us by what we do in the  months and years ahead.</p><p>QUEST:  Brad, I'm going to go out to the frolic of my own here and ask you  -- you would have seen today Starbucks has announced it's closing 8,000 of  its stores for one day for racial bias training.</p><p>And this is the sort of moral leadership that companies lead, isn't it? I  mean, you know, one could argue about the event that happened in  Philadelphia, but it's how companies respond to crisis that's important.   Would you agree?</p><p>SMITH:  I do agree with that, and you know, Kevin Johnson; the CEO of  Starbucks is somebody who worked at Microsoft with us closely for many  years, in the world today, we all have our difficult days.</p><p>And as you put it quite rightly, it's how we respond to those difficult  days that are the tests of our times.  I'm not an expert on Starbucks  issues, but I do believe that there are all days when we have to stand up  for principles. </p><p>And among those principles is the importance of respect for other people  and a world that honors diversity and inclusion.  And do you think that is  getting more difficult in an era where social media social discourse, even  presidential discourse has become so difficult, so toxic that maintaining  integrity has become much trickier? </p><p>SMITH:  I think it's a challenging time, I think you're right to frame it  as a difficult time.  I think it's a time that requires the leaders,  whether they'd be in business or anywhere else.</p><p>Really understand the principles for which they want to stand up and they  have the courage of their convictions.  And there are days when -- you  know, people will disagree they have the right to. </p><p>But I do think that people ultimately respect those who have the courage of  their convictions and are clear in taking principled stands.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  Well, you said you've taken a principled stand, so with  this document, I will be watching closely in the days, weeks, months and  years ahead to see as I suspect, you expect. </p><p>SMITH:  I would expect nothing less, thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Brad, as always, thank you for taking time to join  us -- </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight.  When we come back, pretty horrific, horrifying, cared  for(ph).  A Southwest plane has an engine failure that punches the  fabric  -- that punches the fuselage and the person is killed after being nearly  sucked out of the aircraft.  After the break, we'll tell you more about it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  For anybody who flies, it's a nightmare scenario.  A person is dead  after an accident on a Southwest flight from New York to Dallas, forcing an  emergency landing because of an explosive decompression after the result of  an engine exploding.</p><p>An NTSB team is currently on its way to Philadelphia.  So this is what we  know, all believe the facts are.  The left wing number one engine as you  see here appear to explode, and then part of its fractured or entered the  cabin, blowing out one of the windows here which is you can see. </p><p>Now since the plane was in altitude, they caused an explosive decompression  we believe a passenger was almost sucked out of the aircraft before being  pulled back in again.</p><p>Over the last hour, the NTSB chairman said incidents like this are  extremely unusual. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHRISTOPHER HART, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD:  Engine  failure.  How frequent does the NTSB see what we technically do qualify as  a non-contained engine failure.</p><p>I may ask that that is about three or four a year, and not all of those  involve U.S. carriers.  In last Fall, there was a A380 that had an  uncontained engine failure over Greenland and was not a U.S. carrier. </p><p>So we see about three or four of those a year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Peter Goelz is the former managing director of the NTSB, joins me  from Washington.  What's your understanding of what happened here  particularly in the face of a first someone who died.</p><p>PETER GOELZ, FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY  BOARD:  Well, I mean, the NTSB is going to treat this as a major  investigation.  We don't know what happened.</p><p>I mean, the obvious culprit is the internal workings of the engine.  The  reality is the CFM engine is a real work horse.  You know, it doesn't need  to be overhauled for 50,000 hours.  </p><p>But something let loose or something came off that caused that engine to  disintegrate and penetrate the cabin.  And it's -- we will find out  shortly.</p><p>QUEST:  Of course Southwest had a very similar incident just a couple of  years ago, where also number one engine penetrated the fuselage, on that  occasion nobody was injured.</p><p>But it's going to raise questions on the CFM snuck-around engines. </p><p>GOELZ:  Yes it will and it will raise questions about where they're  maintained, how they're maintained.  They will look at the manufacturing of  the individual blades, if it was a blade that failed. </p><p>[16:45:00] You know, there are microscopic fatigue crash that can sometimes  go unexamined and can, you know, develop into a catastrophe.</p><p>QUEST:  If we look at the major incidents of this, and let us do the recent  ones.  I mean, you've got the BA at Las Vegas -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Right -- </p><p>QUEST:  The 777, you've got the American 76, and you have Qantas, the 32.   They all have massive engine failures where the nacelle doesn't contain the  debris.  Is this something that needs to be examined.</p><p>GOELZ:  Well, I think it does, I mean, the old theory or the current  working knowledge is that the cowling and the nacelle has to be able to,  you know, contain an engine disintegration.</p><p>You know, there's got to a major -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Titanium, if they're not being able to do that because of the brake  efficiency and the high power nature of these engines, then they're going  to have to revisit that -- their requirement.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you see any urgent or immediate NTSB action in this regard?</p><p>GOELZ:  Well, I think they're going to look very carefully if they've got  at the fan blades and at the compressors.  If they see something, they will  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Great -- </p><p>GOELZ:  Not hesitate.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally, Peter, there's an inevitability that once -- you'll be  familiar with the phrase here, the liberated parts.  And once the liberated  part are ejected from the engine, there's almost an inevitability because  of the proximity that the fuselage and the passengers become a risk.</p><p>Certainly, you saw that even more so with the old days of the delta in 1996  where you had the engine nine which went -- which blew at the back.</p><p>GOELZ:  Right, I was on scene for that accident and it was just dreadful.   And you know, those engines are nacelle-up next to the fuselage and that is  a real challenge.</p><p>QUEST:  Peter, thank you, good to see you sir, come back and help us  understand it when we get some reports from the NTSB.  Which grade would  you --  </p><p>GOELZ:  I will, thank you. </p><p>QUEST:  Thanks with you.  We continue tonight, China is taking a twin-track  approach to its trade standoff with the United States.  We're really  looking at Beijing's strategy after the break.</p><p>And of course, the chief economist at the IMF who says protectionism could  strangle global growth. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  When it comes to responding to threats about trade, China is  deploying both the carat(ph) and the stick(ph).  Here's the carat(ph), it  is the restrictions imposed on non-Chinese car makers to be removed by --  not 2022, from 2022.</p><p>[16:50:00] Until now, they had to share factory ownership and profits with  Chinese companies.  The sort of JV arrangement.  And this is the  restrictions, easier access, bad tariffs to be originated.  Now, from  Wednesday, Beijing says it will apply 117 percent tariffs on U.S. sorghum  imports. </p><p>Washington this week banned U.S. suppliers from selling parts of software  to ZTE; a major Chinese tech company because of sanctions busting.  The  shares were suspended in Hong Kong.</p><p>And the Treasury Secretary on Monday tweeted by the president on currencies  saying that that tweet was a warning shot.  Donald Trump accuse China of  devaluing its currency.</p><p>In his new world economic -- out of the will, the IMF says protectionism is  a major risk to the global economy.  Earlier on, press expressed the firm's  chief economist said countries need to be cautious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAURICE OBSTFELD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, IMF:  Of course, and we should remember  that trade is to their mutual benefit, it's been a driver of growth through  the entire post-war period.</p><p>So you know, we do worry that there could be escalation with measures and  counter measures.  We hope that countries will instead collaborate in a  multilateral spirit and resolve their differences.</p><p>QUEST:  At the moment, the environment is pretty good as you say, U.S. is  growing faster now, employment, low unemployment, low inflation but rising  interest rates.</p><p>Are you worried about the speed at which these rates are going up in the  U.S.?</p><p>OBSTFELD:  You know, the U.S. is embarking on a historically large fiscal  expansion at a time when it's at full employment.  And our projections call  for U.S. unemployment rate to fall to levels that we haven't seen since the  late 1960s. </p><p>That could pose inflation risks and the Fed would meet those by raising  interest rates perhaps more times than it's currently foreseeing.  So yes,  we do worry that there could be a spike in the interest rates and that  would not only be a U.S. issue, it would affect dollar debts worldwide.</p><p>It affects capital flows to emerging markets.</p><p>QUEST:  The president of the United States criticized Russia and China  yesterday for what he says was currency devaluations.  But he's wrong,  isn't he? There should be no managed devaluation of those currencies if  anything in the case of China, quite the opposite.</p><p>OBSTFELD:  You know, well, China has spent about a trillion dollars in  reserves, not recently but certainly in 2015 and 2016, preventing its  currency from depreciating.</p><p>You know, we judge that, it might have to appreciate a bit in the future to  keep the current account in line, but it's not grossly undervalued.  Russia  has a floating exchange rate and it has depreciated a lot recently. </p><p>But part of the reason for that has been the new sanctions on Russia. </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk finally, Maurice, as you look across the world and you  see the various factors, whether it's Brexit, higher interest rates in the  U.S., sanctions on Russia, China trade.  What is the one thing at the  moment that you would urge I should keep my eye on? </p><p>OBSTFELD:  Well, I think we should look on debts worldwide and our fiscal  monitor which comes out tomorrow will talk about that.  Whether you look at  sovereign debts, corporate debts, household debts, they're historically  high. </p><p>And as interest rates go up, as Central Banks normalize monetary policies,  there's uncertainty about what the prospects will be.  That's why we  recommend that governments in particular reduce those debts so that they  have some ammunition when the next recession comes.</p><p>And as good as things are now, we know there will be another recession some  day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  That we can be sure, another recession someday.  A sober warning  from Maurice Obstfeld.  The Dow climbed more than 200 points on Tuesday  after a number of better-than-expected earnings.</p><p>Shares have -- putting up 11 percent, and the interesting thing about that  it was only after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendations on the stock  and said user growth was picking up, IBM shares are down 5 percent, down  for us, United Airlines is up 3 percent.</p><p>Both reported earnings in this hour.  I'll look at quickly the European  bosses, the Euro bosses, Dax at its best level since February.  To get an  idea of the markets, a strong day across the board with the Dax having --  up 1.5 percent and the New York markets up strongly as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] We will take a profitable moment after a short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, Starbucks have shown us exactly how a  crisis is supposed to be handled after two men were arrested for not buying  anything and then thrown out of the store, I call this year's crisis that  hit Starbucks. </p><p>But the way the company responded first of all immediately, the CEO  apologized.  Said it was reprehensible, should not have happened, it was  wrong.  Has held a meeting with the men who were arrested to apologize  again and started training on unconscious bias. </p><p>And now finally closing the whole Starbucks network of 8,000 stores in the  United States, a one day of training.  Now of course, a one day training  isn't going to be necessarily enough, but the fact Starbucks has shown such  leadership on such a tricky, difficult issue, it speaks volumes for the way  the company is actually following its own principles.</p><p>Compare that to United Airlines or to Facebook or to Equifax and how when  they had their crisis, they had to blame somebody else, disappeared off  into the distance, weren't seen and the apology came to you too little and  too late.</p><p>No, Starbucks has proven exactly why it is so successful because it does  what it says it will do.  When things go wrong, it puts them right.  And  that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I'm Richard Quest in New York.   Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  Let's  meet tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It has big global ambitions and an aggressive founder in Shintaro Yamada. What is more, its price popped 67%, Silicon Valley-style, when it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at Tuesday's opening, and closed the day up 77%. That sparked a level of buzz Tokyo had been missing for many years. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But one question faces Tokyo's tech community: Is Mercari an exciting omen of things to come or a mere aberration? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is easy to think the latter. Japan's pipeline of startup sensations is modest at best. Mercari is part of Japan's thriving thrift economy, a reminder of the deflationary matrix in which millennials were steeped. Graduates still opt for safe jobs at Sony or Toyota over risking failure in the startup game. </p><p>Japan's first big tech wave ended rather abruptly. Rakuten, Yahoo Japan and CyberAgent all got clobbered when the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s. Livedoor's comeuppance in 2006 and the global financial crisis two years later had entrepreneurs lowering their sights and taking jobs at corporate giants. </p><p>Mercari puts Tokyo back on the radar. That one of this year's most tantalizing tech payoffs came in aging Japan, not California or China, may reanimate a stunted startup scene. And it presents an ideal opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to reinvigorate his reform push. </p><p>Since returning to power in 2012, Abe has talked early and often about rekindling the innovative spirit that propelled Japan into the Group of Seven orbit. In September 2013, Abe visited the New York Stock Exchange and declared, \"I would like to turn Japan into an entrepreneurial powerhouse brimming with the entrepreneurial spirit, just like the United States.\" </p><p>In April 2015, Abe dropped by Stanford University and said: \"Improving the situation for existing companies is not enough. I want to soak up all that Silicon Valley has to offer and take the lessons to Japanese.\" Yet, as Abe also explained, American tech titans once learned from Japan Inc. In the 1980s, Sony, Toshiba and others set the global agenda -- and Japan can once again. </p><p>But Abe has been glacial in his approach to regaining that innovative mojo. To date, he has favored aggressive monetary easing and corporate governance tweaks. That sent stocks soaring and generated record corporate profits, but did little to inspire inventiveness. Abe made the very mistake he warned of at Stanford -- targeting existing companies, not scrappy, game-changing new ones. </p><p>The crux of the problem is too much messaging and not enough action. To Abe's credit, the government is looking to ride Mercari's coattails. Earlier this month, it detailed a strategy to nurture a fresh wave of unicorns to raise Japan's digital-economy footprint. By lifting regulations and tackling monopolies enjoyed by Google, Amazon and other U.S. giants, Tokyo hopes to cultivate 20 unicorns by 2023. Yet even this latest push lacks creativity and teeth. </p><p>How best to disrupt Japan Inc.? First, Abe must engineer the regulatory big bang he promised in 2012. That means slashing the notorious bureaucracy standing in the way of entrepreneurs creating jobs. In the World Bank's latest \"Ease of Doing Business\" rankings, Japan came in 34th. That puts Abe's economy eight rungs behind Thailand, 10 behind Malaysia, and fully 29 behind Hong Kong and 32 behind Singapore. </p><p>The gaps with Hong Kong and Singapore are particularly problematic, given Japan's weak English skills and rigid immigration laws. Equally notable: Japan's rankings have worsened on Abe's watch (it was 23rd in 2012). With majorities in both houses of parliament and a reform plan the public supports, Abe should bulldoze sweeping changes to reduce the time, difficulty and barriers that discourage local innovators and drive foreign ones elsewhere. </p><p>Tokyo should craft a tax-holiday scheme. Abe's team could say this to 20-somethings looking to follow Mercari's lead: If you start a new venture today, you pay no corporate taxes for a few years or, at most, a negligible rate of 5% to 10%. Forget tired, unworkable gimmicks like \"special-enterprise zones\" that have not worked for South Korea or China. Instead, morph the entire nation into one. The key is shifting incentives to encouraging job creation from the ground up, not protecting established giants. </p><p>Mercari's Yamada personifies Abe's hopes for a startup renaissance. Yamada's global ambitions are more in step with Masayoshi Son's strategy at SoftBank than one typically finds in Japan. But cultivating the next Yamada requires considerable heavy lifting on the reform front. Abe cannot conjure up an innovative revolution rhetorically. </p><p>The natural resources are there. Japanese caution, for example, has not stopped a wave of innovation in the cryptocurrency space. A steady flow of new exchanges is setting up Tokyo as a global hub for blockchain innovation. Any search for Japan's next unicorn includes bitcoin exchanges like bitFlyer and Coincheck -- that is, if change-averse bureaucrats do not wreck things by stifling the market's laissez-faire ethos. </p><p>To encourage greater risk-taking, Tokyo should broaden social safety nets to catch entrepreneurs that fail. It might consider greater tax incentives for venture capitalists to dole out financing, including providing public money. The ends of setting aside several billions of dollars of taxpayer money might justify the means. It might yield greater economic payoffs than a weaker yen or public-works spending. </p><p>Startup funding in Japan is rather pitiful given the potential -- about $1.3 billion a year compared with roughly $70 billion in the U.S. and $20 billion in China. </p><p>Abe also should call Son in for a chat. Over the last 18 months, no one has shaken up the venture capital world more than Japan's richest man. Single-handedly, Son shook up sectors, including chipmaker, robotics, satellite, renewable energy and indoor farm, and used his stakes in Uber, Didi Chuxing, Grab and Ola to commandeer the ride-sharing space. Yet Son has put virtually none of that largess to work in Japan. </p><p>Now, as Son works to double the size of his $100 billion Vision Fund, Abe should make his own pitch. Why not ask Son, Yamada, Hiroshi Mikitani of e-commerce juggernaut Rakuten and other tech moguls to help prioritize an immediate to-do list? Pick their brains on how to smash the groupthink that restrains risk-taking, and what tweaks could be made to education and training to inspire millennials. Ask, too, what it might take to get them to support the next wave of domestic unicorns. </p><p>Another topic for Son and his ilk: the mafia. Not the yakuza, but an ecosystem of innovators akin to the \"PayPal Mafia\" that changed the face of Silicon Valley. The name flowed from a 2007 Fortune magazine cover casting the PayPal billionaires as faux mobsters. Those riches and lessons helped create YouTube, LinkedIn, SpaceX, online review site Yelp and other disrupters. </p><p>\"I would not be surprised if a 'Mercari Mafia' of incredible founders rise after this IPO,\" James Riney, head of 500 Startups' $35 million Japanese fund, told the TechCrunch website last month. \"I can't wait to back them!\" </p><p>Abe's team should do the same to make Japan's Silicon Valley dream a reality -- and reboot Abenomics. It is high time to break through the political constraints standing in Japan's way. The buzz over Mercari is Abe's ticket to regaining the momentum. </p><p>William Pesek is an award-winning Tokyo-based journalist and author of \"Japanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan's

Last week, two people I know came up and asked: \"Should I buy some of this stuff?\" After about 30 seconds, it became clear that they didn't really know what Bitcoin was or how to actually buy it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guessing that these people aren't alone, I think it's worth a quick recap. So here are some of the questions you may have about Bitcoin but are too embarrassed to ask.</p><p>1. What is Bitcoin? The five-second version is that it's a digital currency that can't be copied and pasted and is based on relatively sound, secure technology (called Blockchain).</p><p>2. It really can't be hacked? The underlying Blockchain technology is considered very secure, so much so that institutions such as banks are now trying to adopt some of its parts in their own financial systems. That said, some of the repositories where Bitcoin is held have been hacked in the past, so it hasn't been completely flawless from a security perspective.</p><p>3. Why has it shot up so quickly in value? Three reasons. (i) A core group of people have deep confidence in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin or Ripple) as a genuinely long-term alternative to existing currency systems. Some of these individuals are key players in commerce and tech.</p><p>(ii) Despite the vagaries and difficulties involved in buying and selling it, it's cheaper and arguably more secure than cash transactions.</p><p>(iii) Because it's outside most regulatory oversight, cyber criminals have adopted it wholesale.</p><p>4. Will it continue rising in value? Honestly, I don't know. Neither does anyone else. However, a couple of recent developments have widened its investment appeal.</p><p>The biggest is probably the opening of a futures market in Bitcoin at Chicago's Futures Exchange.</p><p>This essentially puts Bitcoin in a similar investment bracket to any other asset, such as pork bellies or orange juice. It means that ordinary investors can now buy into Bitcoin without going near a 'digital wallet' of their own.</p><p>One of Germany's markets, the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse, is reportedly mulling a similar move.</p><p>5. With its value rising so fast, it sounds like a bubble...</p><p>Yes it does. And that's the conclusion that a great many financial commentators have come to. On the other hand, many of the same commentators have dismissed Bitcoin from its 2009 start.</p><p>6. Is it too late to invest in it? No - although it's probably too late to get rich quick by 'mining' it (the process where you throw computing power to 'unlock' Bitcoin) from your home PC. If that's something you were considering doing, bear in mind you'll be competing with industrial mining operations that have access to servers and electricity costs that are far, far cheaper than is available in Ireland.</p><p>7. Who owns it? The official answer is no-one. It was developed by a person (or persons) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. But the identity of this person (or persons) has never been authenticated. He/she/they may be dead. Or they may be a malicious organisation.</p><p>But one recent report claims that 40pc of all Bitcoin is owned by around 1,000 individuals, many of whom are Chinese 'miners' using cheap (or free) electricity. That suggests the Chinese government may have a significant influence on the currency.</p><p>8. If it's a currency, what can I buy with it? Very little. A few online stores, such as Overstock, Expedia and some parts of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Microsoft.com\">www.Microsoft.com</url>, take it when you're shopping. Almost no-one you regularly ship with in Ireland does. This is a basic problem with Bitcoin. It was set up as an alternative currency or trading unit. It has now being treated as something much closer to a standalone asset such as 'gold' - something to be invested on purely speculative terms.</p><p>9. Is this just a tech joke gone too far? No. The technology underpinning Bitcoin is being looked at as a model for all sorts of systems, both inside and outside finance and technology. While there are still many in the banking and financial regulatory community who deride Bitcoin as a \"scam\" and compare to tulip-mania, the fundamentals behind cryptocurrencies don't look to be in jeopardy of collapsing anytime soon.</p><p>? Finally, may I beg your indulgence for a selfish plug on our behalf? This weekend, we have launched a new podcast. The Big Tech Show With Adrian Weckler is what it sounds like - a new tech podcast that looks at some of the big issues crossing from the tech sector into broader society and business life. On the first episode, which is now live at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.independent.ie/podcasts\">www.independent.ie/podcasts</url> (or iTunes or Soundcloud), I'm joined by former RTE, Storyful and Twitter boss Mark Little to talk about the future of news and the control that social media firms currently hold over media.</p><p>Next week, the show has an exclusive interview with one of Ireland's most successful young tech entrepreneurs who, while not yet 35, has raised (EURO)100m for his online venture.</p><p>In the New Year, we have a number of special broadcasts lined up highlighting the best of Irish startups and ideas they have for changing things around us. Each episode will also review the most interesting new technology products and services that come our way.</p><p>We think that this is a way to share more with you, the reader, from what we gather every week.

In this series we'll examine some of the most popular doomsday scenarios prognosticated by modern AI experts. You can't have a discussion about killer robots without invoking the Terminator movies. The franchise's iconic T-800 robot has become the symbol for our existential fears concerning today's artificial intelligence breakthroughs. </p><p>What's often lost in the mix however, is why the Terminator robots are so hellbent on destroying humanity: because we accidentally told them to. This is a concept called misaligned objectives. The fictional people who made Skynet[1] (spoiler alert if you haven't seen this 35 year-old movie), the AI that powers the Terminator robots, programmed it to safeguard the world. When it becomes sentient and they try to shut it down, Skynet decides that humans are the biggest threat to the world and goes about destroying them for six films and a very underrated TV show. The point is: nobody ever intends for robots that look like Arnold Schwarznegger to murder everyone. It all starts off innocent enough - Google's AI can now schedule your appointments over the phone[2] - then, before you know it, we've accidentally created a superintelligent machine and humans are an endangered species.  Could this happen for real? There's a handful of world-renowned AI and computer experts who think so. Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom's Paperclip Maximizer[3] uses the arbitrary example of an AI whose purpose is to optimize the process of manufacturing paperclips. Eventually the AI turns the entire planet into a paperclip factory in its quest to optimize its processes.  Stephen King's 'Trucks[4]' imagines a world where a mysterious comet's passing not only gives every machine on Earth sentience, but also the ability to operate without a recognizable power source. And - spoiler alert if you haven't read this 46 year-old short story - it ends with the machines destroying all humans and paving the entire planet's surface. A recent NY Times op-ed[5] from AI expert Stuart Russel began with the following paragraph: The arrival of superhuman machine intelligence will be the biggest event in human history. The world's great powers are finally waking up to this fact, and the world's largest corporations have known it for some time. But what they may not fully understand is that how A.I. evolves will determine whether this event is also our last. Russel's article - and his book[6] - discuss the potential for catastrophe if we don't get ahead of the problem and ensure we develop AI with principles and motivations aligned with our human objectives. He believes we need to create AI that always remains uncertain about any ultimate goals so it will defer to humans. His fear, it seems, is that developers will continue to brute-force learning models until a Skynet situation happens where a system 'thinks' it knows better than its creators.  On the other side of this argument are experts who believe such a situation isn't possible, or that it's so unlikely that we may as well be discussing theoretical time-traveling robot assassins. Where Russel and Bostrom argue that right now is the time to craft policy and dictate research dogma surrounding AI, others think this is a bit of a waste of time. Computer science professor Melanie Mitchell, in a response[7] to Russel's New York Times op-ed, writes: It's fine to speculate about aligning an imagined superintelligent \u2014 yet strangely mechanical \u2014 A.I. with human objectives. But without more insight into the complex nature of intelligence, such speculations will remain in the realm of science fiction and cannot serve as a basis for A.I policy in the real world. Mitchell isn't alone, here's a TNW article[8] on why Facebook's AI guru, Yann LeCun, isn't afraid of AI with misaligned objectives.  The crux of the debate revolves around whether machines will ever have the kind of intelligence that makes it impossible for humans to shut them down. If we believe that some ill-fated researcher's eureka moment will somehow imbue a computer system with the spark of life, or a sort of master algorithm[9] will emerge that allows machine learning systems to exceed the intellectual abilities of biological intelligence, then we must admit that there's a chance we could accidentally create a machine 'god' with power over us.  For the time being it's important to remember that today's AI is dumb. Compared to the magic of consciousness, modern deep learning is mere prestidigitation. Computers don't have goals, ideals, and purposes to keep them going. Without some incredible breakthrough, this is unlikely to change. The bad news is that big tech research departments and government policy-makers don't appear to be taking the existential threats that AI could create seriously.The current goldrush may not last forever, but as long as funding an AI startup is essentially a license to print money we're unlikely to see politicians and CEOs push for regulation. This is scary because it's a perfect scenario for an accidental breakthrough. While it's true that AI technology has been around for a long time and researchers have promised human-level AI for decades, it's also true that there's never been more money or personnel working on the problem than there is now. For better or worse, it looks like our only protection against superhuman AI with misaligned objectives is the fact that creating such a powerful system is out of reach for current technology.

Sometimes in periods of volatility, private equity has actually performed better. There will be opportunities afforded by the trade tensions; we continue to watch it closely.<br/><br/>Wen Tan: While the trade war does come up in conversations, our house view is that things will probably get worse before they get better in terms of the geopolitical dynamics.<br/><br/>Does it affect sentiment? Yes, it has affected sentiment in the market. Will it affect underlying performance? I think it all very much depends. If you are a small, lower mid-market domestically focused services-oriented company in China compared with if you are a large exporter based in China that's part of a global supply chain into the US, the impact will be different for those two organisations.<br/><br/>The way that we invest in China has historically been with a bias towards domestically focused businesses. Globally whilst we invest across the full spectrum, we do think that the lower mid-market space offers greater opportunity for upside as well as protection against any market correction.<br/><br/>How has the firm's Asia team changed post-merger?<br/><br/>GM: Our team has remained consistent. Post-merger there was little or no overlap between Standard Life and Aberdeen in respect of Asia. We did have overlap in Europe which we dealt with.<br/><br/>WT: There has been a fundamental difference in how we work now as part of a very large organisation - we believe that's a big advantage. With co-investments, we work very closely now with the public equities teams. For example, when we look at a healthcare co-investment, we have the ability to tap healthcare-focused experts; if we are looking at an Indonesian opportunity, we can call up our Jakarta office and ask about local dynamics and regulation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://vimeo.com/289058451/12bd2aa356\">https://vimeo.com/289058451/12bd2aa356</url><br/>Watch McDonald's video on Asia's rising influence in private equity<br/><br/><br/><br/>What are some trends in private equity investing in Asia and globally that stand out? <br/><br/>GM: I think we have seen a real explosion in operational partners as opposed to purely financial partners. As a result, we spend a lot of time understanding how to potentially create value and trying to understand how various GPs differentiate themselves, as opposed to a more generalist-type model.<br/><br/>We are also seeing a proliferation of sector-specific funds. Sometimes these are teams that spin out from bigger managers, frustrated with succession issues or with the size and scale of the business. And you can argue in a way that these smaller teams, smaller fund sizes are better aligned with LPs because they are focused on better outperformance as opposed to being focused on fee generation.<br/><br/>Lastly, we live in the era of separately managed accounts. That plays to our strengths in that we have a fairly extensive menu, whether our clients want funds customised purely for geographical or sector reasons. LPs are also becoming more sophisticated in terms of exposure, whether they want technology, venture, growth, buyout, or a US or Asia-focus.<br/><br/>How about standout themes in China private equity?<br/><br/><br/><br/>WT:\u00a0If you look at the evolution of the [China] buyout market, you'll see the privatisation of state-owned enterprises and more importantly, this whole cohort of family businesses where the founders are reaching the age now where succession becomes an issue.<br/><br/>And if you think fundamentally about how capitalism has evolved in China over the past three decades this is really the first time that we are coming up to where you get these founders who are reaching retirement age. Opportunities in this space will grow.<br/><br/>From an LP perspective one of the big questions on emerging Asia private equity has been the fact that TVPIs [total value to paid-in capital] remain strong but the DPIs [distributions to paid-in] take time to catch up. And part of the reason is you've got minority investments where your only exit route is through the public markets. When you are in a majority, control buyout situation then your optionality of exit routes becomes a lot broader - you can sell on to a large-cap private equity house, a strategic or via the public market. All things being equal, there is often an LP preference for buyouts.<br/><br/>How are the big tech GPs in Asia disrupting the industry?<br/><br/>GM: We are seeing these funds having bigger influence in the market, which is a response to investor demand. Sometimes there is a fear in the investor community of missing out. And this [fear of missing out] is alive and well in certain aspects of that.<br/><br/>With the pace of disruption ever increasing, I don't see that in any way relenting and people in the industry are determined to capture that. We live in the era of the unicorn where companies are staying private longer. They are outliving the initial capital structures that were formed for them, so we do see that landscape changing in terms of how these companies are funded, certainly longer than typical 10-year fund life. That trend will continue as disruption is alive and well in every level of industry, whether it's driven purely by technology or changes in practice. As investors we have to be alert to that or we get left behind.<br/><br/>Graham McDonald is head of global private equity based in Edinburgh. He is responsible for the Aberdeen global private equity business and is chairman of the investment committee.<br/><br/>Wen Tan is co-head of Asia private equity based in Hong Kong. He focuses on sourcing, evaluating and executing primary investments in the Asia Pacific region with a particular focus on South-East Asia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEIONL-482543</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEIONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T81-6BR1-F0CX-9368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">342670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><timeReceived>7:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 PEI Media Ltd.

As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.</p><p>President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.</p><p>As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on - what some writers called \"reparations by any other name.\" He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.</p><p>The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.</p><p>The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the \"Accountability Clubs\" that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a \"problematic\" tweet.</p><p>The Accountability Clubs bore the motto \"Truth and Mercy.\" Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that \"moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.\" Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.</p><p>The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.</p><p>The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix - pro-LGBTQ, pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.</p><p>At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events - slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.</p><p>The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.</p><p>The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being - healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier - the YMCA, the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.</p><p>By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an AFL-CIO of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.</p><p>In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.</p><p>Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party - socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs - the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.</p><p>Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.</p><p>David Brooks has been a columnist with The Times since 2003. He is the author of \"The Road to Character\" and, most recently, \"The Second Mountain.\" @nytdavidbrooks</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0106983613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWY-3JG1-JBM5-R308-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 4, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

And those two genres, in terms of live viewership, are head and shoulders above any other genre.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ripley added: \"The current marketplace is getting flooded by big tech - Netflix and Amazon - on the general entertainment side. That's a problem for anyone who wants to make money. We didn't want to go up against 800-pound gorillas with unlimited cash.\"</p><p>Disney was forced to sell the RSNs, as they are known, by the Department of Justice because of antitrust concerns as part of its $71.3 billion acquisition of Fox's entertainment assets that closed earlier this year. (The slimmed-down new Fox is also built on news and live sports.) By acquiring the 21 RSNs, Sinclair will own the linear TV and streaming rights to the games of 42 pro teams: 14 Major League Baseball teams, 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL teams. The sale requires Department of Justice approval.</p><p>The purchase includes a tapestry of rights on channels across the country, from Phoenix to Detroit to St. Louis. These are often among the most-watched local stations, but much of the networks' financial success since many were formed in the 1990s has been tied to the cable bundle.</p><p>The channels, which pay teams for the rights to broadcast games and then sell those rights to cable distributors, have counted on wide distribution of cable packages. In addition to lost revenue for RSNs from cord-cutting, many of the rights deals include already-locked-in annual increases in payments to teams. And as some networks have asked for higher distribution fees, they have been met with pushback.</p><p>SportsNet LA, which shows Dodgers games in Los Angeles, is not available in many homes in Los Angeles. Comcast did not carry the YES Network, which airs New York Yankees games, in 2016.</p><p>Ripley said he expects to package the RSNs and broadcast channels to cable distributors, which pay fees to broadcast stations even though they are available over the air free. He suggested there would be some business operations streamlining involved in sales and back-end management as well.</p><p>\"We will package things up and incentivize distributors to take everything in one package,\" Ripley said. \"Already having good relationships with distributors will be a benefit. And we're not going to market with unreasonable asks. We don't expect this to be a fast-growing revenue business.\"</p><p>What the channels do have is exclusivity, which Ripley emphasized. If St. Louis Cardinals fans want to watch the Cardinals, or Detroit Tigers fans want to watch the Tigers, they will have to go to Sinclair.</p><p>\"I fundamentally believe that sports rights will be valuable for the foreseeable future and will continue to increase in value,\" Ripley said. \"There is no greater form of entertainment in terms of passion and willingness to spend. That's the passion we're tapping into and supplying, no matter what happens to the cable bundle, streaming, digital - these games will have a place in any ecosystem.\"</p><p>Ripley said Sinclair also sees opportunity in legalized sports betting and building out content on the RSNs. When they were owned by Fox before the Disney acquisition, most of the channels offered little beyond live games and pre-and postgame coverage. Sinclair, Ripley said, would also consider airing some RSN content on its broadcast stations in the future.</p><p>Sinclair's push into sports has been in the works for several years. The network is in the process of finalizing a $3.5 billion deal that would make it a part-owner of the YES Network, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations. YES was also part of the Disney-Fox deal. Other partners in that sale include the Yankees and Amazon. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Sinclair also owns the Tennis Channel and has a stake in Stadium, a sports network that is available on broadcast TV and digitally. Earlier this year, Sinclair announced a partnership with the Chicago Cubs to form a new channel to show its games exclusively.</p><p>Additionally, Ripley said, the price of the networks made them particularly attractive. Once valued at more than $20 billion, Sinclair paid roughly half that. Ripley said he believed that the price was lower because many of the usual media firms who would want the RSNs, and could afford them, were unable to bid. AT&amp;T and Comcast probably would have faced regulatory approval issues, while Disney was the current seller and Fox had already sold them.</p><p>Rich Greenfield, an analyst at research firm BTIG, suggested the lowered price tag was indicative of a suppressed market. While the networks might have seemed inexpensive, he said, cord cutting and distribution concerns plus the increased rights payments to teams means that \"most, if not all of the earnings could be wiped away over the next 4-5 years. It is no wonder that every major private equity firm pulled out of the process.\"</p><p>As it has acquired broadcast stations in recent years, Sinclair has come under fire for its conservative-leaning programming during news broadcasts on its local stations. Deadspin created a video that cut together clips of anchors on local stations reading scripted remarks excoriating \"fake news\" that seemed to echo some of President Trump's rhetoric. (Trump also supported Sinclair's effort to acquire Tribune Media, which was ultimately rejected by the FCC.) More recently, Sinclair was criticized for airing a commentary segment on its stations that defended using tear gas on migrants at the border.</p><p>Asked how such reporting about its news operation could affect the reaction to Sinclair's acquisition of the RSNs, Ripley said: \"First of all, I take umbrage that there's anything wrong with our news reporting. But setting that aside, is it a chance to rebrand the company? I think in many ways that is true. But you're not going to see any of these networks branded as Sinclair Sports. We're not a front-facing brand and never will be.\"</p><p>             Read more from The Post:           </p><p>MLB will air 13 games on YouTube this season          </p><p>ESPN has its new MNF booth, but it won't have Jason Witten or the Booger Mobile          </p><p>ESPN the Magazine is closing down          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-731eb982eada4619af4f82ae8c2d3ca2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W25-BBX1-DXKP-J0P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><timeReceived>12:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 6, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC0002G4M</classCode><className>SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Elizabeth Warren's ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The first is by offering their own products on services they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Warren, D-Mass., a presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other \u2014 sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace \u2014 but not both.</p><p> \"You can be an umpire or you can own teams,\" she said. \"But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game.\"</p><p> Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller startups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers and break up the conglomerates.</p><p> Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt., and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials.</p><p> But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague and could backfire if put into effect as written.</p><p> Warren's plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I'd offer a few edits:</p><p> Apply specific fixes to specific problems: One shortcoming in Warren's plan \u2014 and it's an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a finalized set of rules \u2014 is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.</p><p> Lawmakers don't typically craft regulations for individual companies. That's for good reason: A law that specifically applies to Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.</p><p> Instead, Warren's proposal would cover technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces \u2014 a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 and proposes rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)</p><p> The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anticompetitive risks. The stranglehold Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its app store to force burdensome terms on developers.</p><p> The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its service could also threaten Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from accessing their iTunes libraries.</p><p> Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.</p><p> Split off cloud businesses: Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google's ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.</p><p> Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that includes Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.</p><p> The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target.</p><p> It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn't giving young startups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?</p><p> Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies \u2014 each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own \u2014 gives those companies enormous power, and invites anticompetitive abuse.</p><p> For example, let's imagine that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing unit, to help his company's streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix's traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon's streaming-video team should copy.</p><p> To be clear, Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon's privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Warren is trying to address.</p><p> An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.</p><p> Get rid of the app tax: Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.</p><p> At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the \"Apple tax.\" It's the fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google's mobile app store charges similar fees.)</p><p> These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these services' strict developer policies amount to bullying. Last week, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple's app store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.</p><p>Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.</p><p> Don't get lured into a censorship debate: Something bizarre happened last week, when Facebook momentarily took down several of Warren's Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook's ability to \"shut down a debate\" over its power.</p><p> The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a long-standing policy that limits the use of Facebook's name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be \"Facebook's official quiz game\" or whatever.</p><p> But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including conservative lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.</p><p> \"She's right \u2014 Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\" Cruz wrote of Warren in a message on Twitter.</p><p> One problem with the debate over the tech companies' power is that it risks conflating real anticompetitive behavior (like Facebook shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Cruz's unsupported claims that social media services are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for \"neutral\" services.</p><p> The best advice I could possibly give Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid getting sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.</p><p> The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies' power, while leaving their fortresses intact.</p><p> Kevin Roose is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-b48db6872386802369846df81fa492c954e75ea0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNG-MFS1-DXVP-V1YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other \u2014 sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace \u2014 but not both.</p><p>\u201cYou can be an umpire or you can own teams,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.</p><p>Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/senator-orrin-hatch-facebook-biz-model-zuckerberg/\">most</url> elected officials.</p><p>But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.</p><p>Ms. Warren\u2019s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I\u2019d offer a few edits.</p><p>Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren\u2019s plan \u2014 and it\u2019s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules \u2014 is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.</p><p>Lawmakers don\u2019t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That\u2019s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.</p><p>Instead, Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces \u2014 a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)</p><p>The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst <url normalizedValue=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/\">Ben Thompson has written</url>, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.</p><p>The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.</p><p>Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.</p><p>Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google\u2019s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.</p><p>Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix\u2019s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon\u2019s streaming-video team should copy.</p><p>To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon\u2019s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer.

But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.</p><p>Don\u2019t get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren\u2019s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech.

The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook\u2019s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be \u201cFacebook\u2019s official quiz game\u201d or whatever.</p><p>But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right \u2014 Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\u201d Mr. Cruz <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1105523954087849984\">wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitte</url>r.</p><p>One problem with the debate over the tech companies\u2019 power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents\">shutting off</url> data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz\u2019s unsupported       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/us/politics/diamond-silk-facebook.html\">claims</url> that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for \u201cneutral platforms.\u201d</p><p>The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.</p><p>The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies\u2019 power, while leaving their fortresses intact.</p><p>Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

But it has shortcomings worth considering.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUSTIN, Tex. - Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation - besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters - was Senator Elizabeth Warren's ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other - sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace - but not both.</p><p>\"You can be an umpire or you can own teams,\" she said. \"But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game.\"</p><p>Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.</p><p>Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials.</p><p>But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.</p><p>Ms. Warren's plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I'd offer a few edits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apply specific fixes to specific problems. </emphasis>One shortcoming in Ms. Warren's plan - and it's an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules - is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.</p><p>Lawmakers don't typically craft regulations for individual companies. That's for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.</p><p>Instead, Ms. Warren's proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces - a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google - and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)</p><p>The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.</p><p>The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.</p><p>Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Split off cloud businesses. </emphasis>Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google's ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.</p><p>Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.</p><p>The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn't giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?</p><p>Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies - each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own - gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse.</p><p>For example, let's imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company's streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix's traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon's streaming-video team should copy.</p><p>To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon's privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address.</p><p>An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get rid of the \"app tax.\" </emphasis>Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.</p><p>At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the \"Apple tax\": a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google's mobile app store charges similar fees.)</p><p>These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms' strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple's App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.</p><p>Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't get lured into a censorship debate. </emphasis>Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren's Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook's ability to \"shut down a debate\" over its power.</p><p>The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook's name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be \"Facebook's official quiz game\" or whatever.</p><p>But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.</p><p>\"She's right - Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\" Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter.</p><p>One problem with the debate over the tech companies' power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook's shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz's unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for \"neutral platforms.\"</p><p>The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.</p><p>The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies' power, while leaving their fortresses intact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V5-DFH1-JD6R-T0MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VC-CN11-F0NT-H01H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VT-1001-JD6R-T37M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WN-7601-F0NT-H1C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
