Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG[1]) and its wholly owned biotech R...roup, Verily Life Sciences, are helping build a secure center where health records, genomic data, and other personal information from hundreds of thousands of people can be collected, analyzed, and shared with health researchers. The federal initiative is expected to generate a trove of health information, to be gathered from 'a rich diversity' of volunteers across the country, as National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins noted last month[2]. While many details remain vague, Google's deep involvement comes as other key participants in the national effort\u2014called the Precision Medicine Initiative\u2014are raising concerns about the growing reach of tech giants like Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL[3]) into healthcare. Those concerns are shared by the public. </p><p>In a survey published this summer[4] by digital health investment firm Rock Health, respondents were generally positive about sharing their health records and genetic data. But they did not view tech companies as trustworthy stewards. In fact, tech companies shared the lowest marks along with government, which underlines one of the national study's big question marks: how quickly will people sign up for an effort whose premise\u2014the more volunteers, the deeper the insights into ever-more tailored medical treatments and preventive health\u2014requires mass participation? Collins, whose organization is overseeing much of the initiative, raised the question last month, even as he announced a goal to start recruitment by November, only four months away. 'We're curious to know whether we'll be deluged or have to work harder to get the word out,' Collins said. PMI officials acknowledged the importance of gaining the public's trust. 'It's front and center in every decision we're making,' said Gwynne Jenkins, the chief of staff for the PMI cohort program, the team building the volunteer database. To be clear, health data that citizens contribute to the study will be open for research under the purview of the government\u2014not held privately by Google or the other two dozen entities that are building and running the four cornerstones of the PMI. Only a few of those entities are for-profit companies; Google, via Verily, is the highest-profile. Its participation was first publicly revealed in February, when the Obama administration unveiled a pilot project run by Vanderbilt University and Verily to test volunteer attitudes and potential recruitment strategies. The two organizations were going to build an online 'portal'\u2014a term from the old dot-com days that described the efforts of Yahoo, Microsoft, and others to attract Web surfers with search, news, and other information. Verily chief medical officer Jessica Mega said in June her group was well suited to help because of its experience with user interfaces and 'the right cadence of engaging people.' Verily's role has since shifted, however. When Collins announced in July the four multi-million-dollar cornerstone PMI projects, the Vanderbilt-Verily group was put in charge not of recruitment but of an entirely different piece: a coordinating center, headquartered at Vanderbilt's medical center in Nashville, TN, that will gather all the data generated by the nationwide study and make the information available to researchers. The first year of the grant for the Data and Research Support Center is worth $13.6 million, with potentially $72 million over five years. Vanderbilt is the lead contractor. It was 'always the plan' to apply for the coordinating center job, said Vanderbilt associate professor of biomedical informatics Joshua Denny, the school's PMI point man. Vanderbilt had a head start stumping for it. A top spot for health informatics research, the school already houses a national research center[5] for electronic medical records and genomics, funded by the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute. Joining Vanderbilt and Verily is the Broad Institute of Cambridge, MA. The Broad will contribute its expertise generating and working with vast genomic data sets, as well as sophisticated tools to help researchers make sense of the data the PMI aims to collect. So where does Verily fit in? Its parent company does data infrastructure and analytics like few other entities on Earth. Vanderbilt's Denny told Xconomy that the PMI data center would use the Google Cloud data storage platform. (Google has a division of its cloud business tailored to genomics data. It even has a price guide[6].) But Verily itself is best known as a kind of blue-sky lab for device-centered health projects, such as a 'smart' contact lens to monitor a diabetic's glucose level, or electro-implants[7] to rewire a patient's disease. It's the life science version of the Google X think tank that has produced Google Glass and the self-driving car initiative. Verily also aims to run its own long-term health study, called Baseline, which is not affiliated with the PMI. But why it, and not Google, needs to be a front-facing entity on the PMI data center project\u2014even one dedicated to healthcare data\u2014is less clear. Verily officials insist that their group, not Google, be identified as the PMI contractor. When asked what health expertise Verily would bring to the table beyond Google's data management systems, officials with Verily (and everyone else Xconomy interviewed for this article) were quick to caution that it's early days, and not all details have been worked out\u2014even though the launch is planned for November. Their answers describe existing Google infrastructure and expertise, with other layers added by Verily. For example, Mega said Verily would 'leverage' core technology at Alphabet but also would bring engineers 'dedicated to understanding' the range of health data types that the PMI eventually hopes to coordinate. When asked for an example, Verily spokeswoman Carolyn Wang noted that her group has built an experimental genomic analysis tool called dv42 'that uses deep learning on Google infrastructure to identify genetic variants.' (Verily chief technology officer Brian Otis, whose background is in wireless sensors and wearable devices[8], said he wasn't close enough to the PMI project to comment.) Xconomy asked Verily's partners if they had insights into Verily's potential contributions. Other than citing the use of Google Cloud, Vanderbilt's Denny preferred not to comment. Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist and Broad Institute geneticist who is working on the PMI center, said one example could be simpler versions of sophisticated data visualization tools that 'citizen scientists'\u2014not just researchers in academia and industry\u2014can use. 'For example, citizen scientists might want to look at all people who have heart attacks before the age of 45,' analyze their other health patterns, or compare them to other groups, said Kathiresan. 'We will enable that kind of query that's literally like checking boxes. If [Google] can do it for maps, I think they can work with us to do it with health data.' Meanwhile, two leaders of another part of the Precision Medicine Initiative recently published a paper[9] that raised concerns about the rapid move of Google and other tech companies into health care. In a Nature commentary titled 'Stop The Privatization of Health Data,' Scripps Research Institute professor of genomics Eric Topol and John Wilbanks, the chief commons officer of Sage Bionetworks, wrote that huge tech companies bring necessary skills to increasingly complex health data work. 'Yet there is a major downside to monoliths such as Google or smaller companies such as consumer-genetics firm 23andMe owning health data\u2014or indeed, controlling the tools and methods used to match people's digital health profiles to specific services,' they wrote. The concerns include biased profiling, unauthorized use of personal data for marketing (as Web advertising already does), and obstruction of broader research goals. (23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki replied online[10] that 23andMe customers own their own data.) Topol and Wilbanks are proponents of individuals owning their own health data, a view Xconomy described last year[11]. In that regard, their worries about big tech don't directly apply to Google's work on the PMI, whose leaders have insisted that volunteers have unfettered access to their own data and to the results that come from PMI-related research. But their concern is not just about data ownership. It's also about the 'tools and methods,' as Topol and Wilbanks wrote, to analyze the data. They noted the 'black box' problem: sophisticated algorithms that drive deep data analysis in many fields\u2014retail, advertising, law enforcement\u2014can reinforce human biases[12] in troubling ways. Even with the PMI health data open to all, if Google is contributing proprietary algorithms to the research toolkit, that could be a problem, Topol said. 'Tech companies have immense power with their algorithms,' he said. But he also noted that the 'Google-slash-Verily folks knew exactly what the mission is' when awarded the data research center contract. 'They knew the ground rules were, 'This is an open transparent journey'; they knew what they were getting into.' The NIH's James McClain, who is overseeing part of the PMI, said it's a goal of the program that the technology used to translate raw data into analysis should be 'documented and fully understood. We're moving in a direction where we expect that level of transparency,' McClain said. When asked about data-mining algorithms, Verily spokeswoman Wang said Verily wants to help build a data platform that lets researchers 'run their own analytics.' 'Over time, we will have a better sense about what Verily's additional contributions may be to PMI,' Wang said. Other questions about Google's involvement revolve around security and privacy, which the Broad's Kathiresan called a 'big, big challenge.' The project must conform to government cybersecurity standards[13]. Google has formidable security chops. But the PMI center must also be built with a feature no health study has tried before: a 'two-way' structure that permits data to flow back to volunteers. Vanderbilt's Denny called access to one's own data 'a complex and important question. The shortest thing to say is we highly value that ability. But we don't know all the answers. We have tiny amounts of data now. We'll have ridiculous amounts in the future.' Verily will build specialized security software on top of the Google Cloud infrastructure, Verily spokeswoman Wang said. Security experts will be watching closely. With PMI, the government has an opportunity to 'set a gold standard' for consumer expectations around the treatment of personal data, said Steve Weber, faculty director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley. 'That's one of the key stories to tell about this incredibly ambitious initiative.' The involvement of Google, which makes money from mining people's data, 'could make people nervous,' Weber said. When asked about these concerns, Wang provided this statement: 'We do not share personal health information with Google unless we are collaborating with Google on a Verily project or using Google's infrastructure or services, and then only as permitted by law, our contracts, and patient consent. Verily does not permit the use of the personal health information it collects for marketing or similar purposes.' As for the recruitment portal that Vanderbilt and Verily were working on in their pilot project, that job\u2014as well as building mobile apps and wearable sensors\u2014is now in the hands of a group that includes Topol and Wilbanks. That piece of the PMI is dubbed the Participant Technologies Center. In addition to Scripps and Sage, mobile health-app builder Vibrent is the third major contractor. The goal there is to recruit 350,000 Americans, said Topol. (Those recruits would, in effect, walk in off the street. The PMI also aims to bring in hundreds of thousands more people through health plans[14], such as those affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh and Columbia University in New York, and through community health centers.) November is three months away. The last time the Obama administration rushed a healthcare-related portal\u2014the launch of the Affordable Care Act sign-up site Healthcare.gov\u2014it was a disaster[15]. Topol said the only parallel in this case is the government oversight. 'We have exquisite plans for this to run smoothly' at launch, he said. From the get-go, infrastructure should be in place for all volunteers to get a baseline physical exam, a blood draw, and to fill out a survey. But genome sequencing and other high-tech tools, like wearable sensors, wouldn't be available immediately for everyone. 'It won't be launched at scale,' said Topol. Stitching in people's electronic health records could also take some time, especially if they join the PMI on their own instead of through their health plan. As details of Google/Verily's involvement in the PMI continue to emerge, it's also worth noting what the company is not contributing to the PMI. Verily scientists are working on an array of medical devices for their own projects, but for the PMI, wearables and sensors fall under the Participant Technologies Center. And despite months of work on the recruitment pilot, Vanderbilt and Verily aren't handing over technology to the Scripps-led team. 'It was more foundational [thinking] about how to start this program,' said Denny. (Topol characterized the pilot project as 'warm-up things.') A critical part of the PMI will be the consent form that lets volunteers know clearly what they're signing up for. That piece of the recruitment puzzle goes to Wilbanks's Sage Bionetworks. Sage did similar work for the Apple ResearchKit software, which lets citizens share health data through their iPhones with scientists. Vanderbilt and Verily did 'background work' on consent as part of their pilot, said Wilbanks. Notably, the consent form from Verily's own long-term health study called Baseline came under scrutiny just after the pilot project with Vanderbilt was announced. In April, a STAT report[16] questioned whether the consent form in an early version of Baseline, conducted at a health spa owned by Verily's CEO, was transparent about the potential use of volunteers' health data for profit\u2014licensing their data, for example, to drug companies eager for new insights into health and disease. When asked if the Baseline consent form has changed, Mega said, 'We have a responsibility to have consents that inform patients. It always has been and will be our intent to lean into these areas that are regulated and to provide full transparency to patients.' There has been talk that long-term studies such as Baseline or the Murdock study[17] at Duke University might eventually contribute data to the PMI[18], helping it reach its goal of one million people. Mega said there are no plans to funnel data into the PMI from Baseline, which has not begun recruitment beyond the controversial test run. When asked why, Mega implied that the data sets wouldn't line up. Baseline will try to capture 'a more comprehensive view of an individual,' she said, with 'clinical assessments that will require people coming into a facility, undergoing imaging tests or studies beyond genomics. I don't think one million people are going to contribute in that way.' Even if PMI volunteers commit varying levels of information, proponents hope the sheer scale will drive new discoveries. 'This gives us the opportunity to identify root causes of many diseases, the same way that the Framingham Heart Study'\u2014a intergenerational study in Massachusetts that began in 1948[19]\u2014'identified the root causes of heart attacks,' said Broad's Kathiresan. 'With Framingham, data came to the researcher. That's no longer feasible. We're moving to a world where the researcher goes to the data.'

Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, a suspected agent for the terror group Hezbollah is facing serious charges tonight that he scouted dozens of prominent buildings and facilities in New York City as possible targets for attack. Federal officials say the list includes the Empire State Building, Times Square and the United Nations headquarters one week ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting. Correspondent Bryan Llenas has our top story tonight. Good evening, Brian.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. 42-year-old Alexi Saab was arrested in July in New York City and now faces nine counts of federal charges including providing material support to a terrorist organization.</p><p>Federal prosecutors saying \"Saab served as an operative of Hezbollah and conducted surveillance of possible target locations, such convert activities conducted on U.S. soil are a clear threat to our national security.</p><p>Prosecutors say, Saab surveilled dozens of locations on behalf of Hezbollah in New York City including not only the United Nations headquarters of the Statue of Liberty and Times Square, but also the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal. The New York Stock Exchange, Brooklyn Bridge and local airports.</p><p>Saab also gathered intelligence on potential targets in cities like Washington D.C. focusing on the Capitol building, Lincoln Memorial and the White House. And in Boston locations like Fenway Park and the Prudential Center.</p><p>The FBI recovered these photographs from Saab's electronic devices. Investigators say Saab provided Hezbollah details on the structural weaknesses or soft spots of locations, noting details like how close an attacker could get to a target.</p><p>Now according to the indictment Saab joined Hezbollah in 1996 and trained to build explosives. In 2000, Saab first entered the U.S. That same year, prosecutors allege he joined Hezbollah's Islamic Jihad organization or IJO responsible for planning and coordinating terrorist activities.</p><p>He became an American citizen in 2008 and lived in New Jersey. Prosecutors adding \"even though Saab was a naturalized American citizen, his true allegiance was to Hezbollah. The terrorist organization responsible for decades of terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds. Investigators say Bret, Saab also conducted operations outside the United States including once attempting to murder a man he thought to be a suspected Israeli spy. Bret</p><p>BAIER: Bryan, thank you. Lawmakers, the intelligence community and the Trump administration are dealing with a new potentially explosive issue. A whistleblower complaint over an alleged promise made by President Trump to a foreign leader. The case is shrouded in mystery and was the subject of a closed door classified meeting today on Capitol Hill. The President is already pushing back, and the House Intel Chair is threatening to go to court. Chief Intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has the latest tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson brief Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. The Democratic Chairman said the session did not confirm media reporting that the whistleblower complaint involves a phone call where the President made a promise to a foreign leader.</p><p>Still Schiff said the threshold for congressional notification was met and the Intelligence Chief blocked it.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): It was an urgent matter. The Director of National Intelligence has made the unprecedented decision not to share the complaint with Congress.</p><p>HERRIDGE: On Twitter, President Trump called the claims quote another fake news story and referring to the fact that other officials were likely listening to his calls, \"is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader. Well on such a potentially heavily populated call.\"</p><p>American leaders are often measured by what they tell foreign leaders then President Obama famously told the outgoing Russian President, he'd have \"more flexibility to negotiate a defense issue after the election.\" Today, the House Minority leader was skeptical.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I know the media always wants to rush when they think something sensationalist and nine times out of 10, we find out a lot of that's not true. I think the New York Times has experienced that just in the last week.</p><p>HERRIDGE: The new whistleblower complaint may further stress the relationship between the intelligence community and the administration. There are remaining legal questions over whether acting D&amp;I Maguire can share intelligence from executive branch communications.</p><p>SCHIFF: We do know that the Department of Justice has been involved in the decision to withhold that information from Congress. We do not know because we cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: The Acting Director of National Intelligence is scheduled to publicly testify next week. Committee Democrats say they are willing to go to court over the issue while Republicans call that Schiff's statements as extreme adding they are taking a wait and see attitude on the complaint. Bret</p><p>BAIER: Catherine, thank you. Canada's leader is trying for the second day in a row to deal with an emerging scandal as he faces a tough re-election campaign. Pictures have surfaced of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outfitted in dark face makeup during social gatherings when he was younger. Trudeau is now on his second round of apologies. Correspondent Laura Ingle has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expanding his apology today for what is now at least three past incidents of him wearing black and brown face.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: This is something that I deeply, deeply regret.</p><p>INGLE: This barely a day after Trudeau, who is campaigning for re-election, initially confronted allegations on his campaign plane after Time magazine published a photo of him from the West Point Grey Academy 2000-2001 yearbook. It shows Trudeau, who was a teacher at the time, wearing a turban and robes with his face, neck and hands completely darkened as he posed during an Arabian Nights themed party.</p><p>TRUDEAU: I'm going to be asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did. I shouldn't have done that.</p><p>INGLE: Trudeau now admitting he has worn brown or black faced at least three times in his past but couldn't recall if there were more instances adding he has never talked about this publicly because he's embarrassed.</p><p>TRUDEAU: I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.</p><p>INGLE: All of this a shock to many who consider the Canadian Liberal Party leader a champion of minority groups during his nearly four years as prime minister. His political opponents calling Trudeau's past actions disheartening and hurtful.</p><p>ANDREW SCHEER, CANADIAN CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER: And we see with Justin Trudeau are one set of rules for himself and one set of rules for the rest of us.</p><p>JAGMEET SINGH, NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER: I am deeply troubled by what this means to Canada. Young kids are going to see not just one or two, but multiple images of the Prime Minister mocking their reality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGLE: The most recent polling in Canada done before the scandal broke showed Trudeau at the top of the list of who Canadians favor with the current federal political party leaders. The Canadian election takes place October 21st. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Laura, thank you. President Trump's approval numbers have ticked up, but he continues to be under water in the latest Fox News poll. 45 percent of those surveyed approve of the President's job performance, 54 percent do not. His approval, as you see, is up from 43 percent in August.</p><p>47 percent of those polled say the economy is an excellent or good condition. 51 percent think the economy is only fair or poor. This as the President's legal team is trying to stop the latest attempt to get a look at some other numbers, his tax returns.</p><p>Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts has the latest.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump's attorneys today fired back against the Manhattan district attorney, filing suit to block the release of the president's tax returns, claiming because the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting President, it is unconstitutional. This court should declare it invalid and adjoin its enforcement until the President is no longer in office.</p><p>On Monday, the Manhattan DA subpoenaed the President's accounting firm, Mazars USA, demanding eight years of the President's tax returns. In response to the lawsuit, Judge Victor Marrero state enforcement of the subpoenas and scheduled arguments for next Wednesday.</p><p>The only public response from the DA's office, we have received the plaintiff's complaint and will respond as appropriate in court.</p><p>Two other attempts to get President Trump's tax returns are currently tied up in the courts. A subpoena to Mazars from the House Oversight Committee may soon be decided at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. And subpoenas from the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees to Deutsche Bank and Capital One are being considered by the appeals court for the Second Circuit.</p><p>As the President's attorneys battle it out in court. Negotiators for the United States and China are wrestling over how to proceed on a trade deal. Talks at the deputy's levels resumed in Washington in preparation for another high level round next month.</p><p>A new Fox News poll finds 45 percent of registered voters believe tariffs are hurting the U.S. economy. 31 percent say they're helping. At a CNBC conference this morning, Vice President Pence insisting a new trade deal is critical to America's economic future.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The question now is whether or not China wants to do a deal. I think we have a sense. China wants to do a deal. We just don't know if they want to do it yet.</p><p>ROBERTS: And it will still be a while before we find out what President Trump will propose on guns. The President telling our Ed Henry yesterday he is not going to rush a plan.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We're not moving on anything. We're going very slowly in one way because we want to make sure it's right. And we want - we're doing very careful job. We're working with the Democrats. We're working with Republicans.</p><p>ROBERTS: Democrats are puzzled as to what's taking so long.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't know what's holding the President up on it. I know he's busy and we hope to hear from him soon.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump said it's the Democrats fault pointing to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's threat last week. Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR15.</p><p>TRUMP: A lot of Republicans and some Democrats now are afraid to do anything to go down that slippery slope.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: And a court victory for the president today in California, where a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the state of California and a new law that would require presidential candidates to disclose their income tax information in order to qualify for the state's primary ballot. The President's attorney, Jay Sekulow in a statement saying it remains our position that the law is unconstitutional because states are not permitted to add additional requirements for candidates for President. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts live at the North Lawn. John, thank you. Stocks were mixed today. The Dow lost 52. The S&amp;P 500 was up a fraction. The NASDAQ gained 5.5.

Rich Edson is at the State Department. Rich, thanks. There is still no firm plan in place tonight for getting a new government in Israel. Tuesday's election results have left neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his opponent with enough votes to claim power. And the prospect of a third election is being discussed now. Correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest from Jerusalem tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the deadlock over the Israeli elections drags on, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met his opponent, former army chief Benny Gantz, today for the first time in months at a ceremony marking the three year anniversary of former Prime Minister and President Shimon Peres' death.</p><p>The two shook hands as Netanyahu cracked a smile and Gantz stood stoic. In between them was Israeli President Reuben Rivlin, who will give one candidate the nod likely next week to start building a government.</p><p>Netanyahu, who is facing charges of corruption and bribery, could face jail time if he is not elected Prime Minister and able to pass an immunity law. The urgency was seen today as he called for a unity government with his main rival, something he campaigned against doing.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: In these elections, there is no clear winner. And I call on you Benny as the president ordered. Let us work together to bring the state of Israel, to safe shores.</p><p>YINGST: Netanyahu made an agreement with all of the Right-wing parties, having them sign a document saying they would support a joint government only if Netanyahu remained in his position.</p><p>If Gantz gets the support of former Defense Minister and Netanyahu rival Avigdor Lieberman, who will control at least eight seats in the Israeli Knesset, he will surpass the 61 seat majority and increase his chances of becoming Prime Minister.</p><p>BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER CANDIDATE: I want an intent to set a broad and liberal unity government headed by me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YINGST: The surprise offer by Prime Minister Netanyahu to team up with his opponent was quickly rejected by Benny Gantz.

Warren has been drawing big crowds and posting bigger poll numbers as she tries to catch front runner Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential race. Tonight, a look at some of the issues the various contenders are using to keep or get voter and donor support.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us Zuckerberg and other executives at the big tech firms are trying to get extremists off their platforms and Congress off their backs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pounding the pavement up on Capitol Hill today, meeting with a handful of key lawmakers as his company faces multiple antitrust probes and intense public pressure to reform nearly every aspect of its platform.

We don't know which one, but what we do know, what we don't know, and what's next with the panel after a short break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D-CA) CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The Director of National Intelligence has made the unprecedented decision not to share the complaint with Congress. We do not know whether the press reports are accurate or inaccurate about the contents of that complaint.</p><p>KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: I know the media always wants to rush when they think something sensationalist. This is not something I'd ever see the president doing, and I would, instead of jump to conclusions, actually get the facts first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Story came from \"Washington Post\" report about a whistleblower who allegedly told the inspector general the intelligence community about concerns -- urgent concerns -- he had about the president. According to the report, \"Trump's interaction with a foreign leader included a promise that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community. It was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump was speaking with or what he pledged to deliver. One former official says the communication was a phone call.\"</p><p>The president tweeting about the story. \"Another Fake News story out there -- It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \"heavily populated\" call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\"</p><p>So let's start there with our panel, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. OK, Ari, your thoughts on this story?</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Bret, mark me down as curious but highly skeptical. And here's why. When a president makes a phone call to a foreign leader, there's a team of people in the Situation Room of about four or five intelligence officers who are typing every word the president and his counterpart say. That's how a transcript gets created. And that transcript then is shared around the administration as widely or as narrowly as the call requires for people to know that the president talked about.</p><p>If there is something indeed that scandalous, that morally objectionable that the president said, it would have leaked. Somebody along that line would've said something before. And the fact that only one intelligence officer has seen this enough to file a whistleblower report and none of the others who have seen it filed a report, it just makes me highly, highly suspect, especially all the other false accusations against this president before. This sounds like another one.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, we saw some early reporting in President Trump's administration about phone calls he had with various leaders about the specifics of those phone calls from transcripts or actually hearing those calls. So this, I guess, falls into that line.</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes. So when the president talks about fake news, this is very different than some of the other fake news accusations he's made. There is a transcript. There are written assists to the conversation. We don't know how many certainly within his country. But the statute is very clear.</p><p>There obviously seems to be a disagreement between the acting director, Maguire, and the inspector general, who did find this of an urgent nature. And the statute is clear, if that is the case, then he, acting or otherwise, is supposed to provide that information to Congress. So in a sense, he has broken the law. And if there is nothing so damning here, then why isn't Congress being provided with this information right when they requested it? That would be the proper chain of command. It's unprecedented that this is happening, and it's perverting the process, not to follow the process as it has been laid out in the statute and been followed prior.</p><p>BAIER: To Leslie's point, here is Adam Schiff on privilege, again, trying to be used by the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D-CA) CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I don't know whether the White House is directly involved because we can't get an answer to that question. Given that it involves something that the I.G. has already found to be serious and credible and evidence of wrongdoing of one kind or another, there is no privilege that covers that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Jonah?</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, that's debatable. I believe both the Bush administration and the Obama administration also contested this idea of the statute actually compelling the disclosure of executive privilege stuff. There is, according to a lot of constitutional scholars, a solid argument that the president could have done something absolutely terrible or said something absolutely terrible, and he's still within its constitutional prerogatives to keep that secret. So the law is going to be disputed in all that.</p><p>And I take Ari's point, and I generally agree that we should be very skeptical about all of this. There are a lot of people who rushed to judgments or always want to win the race to be wrong first in all this, but there are in fact two people who think this allegation is significant enough. One is the actual whistleblower, and one is the I.G. That should be of concern.</p><p>First of all, the president's tweet is odd in that it actually confirms the story. There's nothing that he alludes to that says the story is fake. He actually confirms that this happened basically. The question is whether or not the actual substance of what he said was so terrible. And we just simply do not know. And the problem is that just as President Trump is not exactly a reliable defender of himself on this, he says inappropriate things all the time and has a long record of it. Adam Schiff isn't reliable either. He's gotten way ahead of the facts for the last two years on the Russia probe and lots of other things, and I think we do have to wait for the facts to come in.</p><p>BAIER: Ari, what about the concern that presidents should be able to have conversations with foreign leaders without getting out?</p><p>FLEISCHER: Absolutely. That's paramount. That's of vital importance for presidents, no matter what your party is, no matter what era you're the president. And presidents need latitude. They need the latitude in a conversation with a foreign leader to be able to say things that they think might move a foreign leader in America's interest, in their direction.</p><p>So take for example, as a hypothetical, Bret, let's say he was talking to the North Korean leader, and he said if you were able to make peace, you're going to be the richest guy in the world. We can make you rich because all that business is going to come in. Is that an inducement, is that a bribe, is that something a whistleblower would say you can't do that, or is that a legitimate use of presidential diplomacy to try to achieve a goal for our country? Presidents have an enormous latitude when it comes to intelligence-sharing and diplomacy, properly so.</p><p>BAIER: We'll see where this goes. We need more facts. We'll bring them to you here.</p><p>Next up, Canada's prime minister in brownface, Israel possibly facing another election. We'll bring you that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.</p><p>ANDREW SCHEER, CANADIAN CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER: Wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity, and someone who is not fit to govern this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: No, it's not the Commonwealth of Virginia and its governor. This is the Canadian prime minister dealing with his own brownface-blackface issue. The pictures, that one an Arabian Nights party, where he was Aladdin. And then we have him dressing up as Harry Belafonte. The prime minister on his second round of apologies. We are back with the panel, start there. Jonah, thoughts?</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know. Look, there's a reason why we get so many stand-up comedians from Canada. It's just a great net exporter of comedy. I know I'm supposed to be scandalized by the blackface, but once you get past the hypocrisy issues and all of that, it's just -- it's one of the most sanctimonious world leaders who is famously a poster boy for sort of woke social justice stuff being hoist on his own petard. I just have popcorn. I don't have anything profound to say about it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, to that point, Meghan McCain tweeted out today that at a town hall recently the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau chastised a woman for saying \"mankind\" instead of \"personkind.\" And yet here he is dealing with this today.</p><p>MARSHALL: I don't want to get on Jonah's bad side, just remind me of that in the future, OK, Bret? With the popcorn there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MARSHALL: Look, I included in this group, many of us have done very stupid things in college. But there's a difference between stupid and offensive. He admits what he did was wrong, it was offensive, it is for the Canadian people to decide. I think that the prime minister today -- I would hope -- is a very different person and he was then. I think that we all are. So I think when he says it's personhood, it's personkind, not mankind or womankind, he's speaking not only to the sensitivities of certain people in the community in Canada but throughout the world. And I believed his apology, and we'll see if the voters in Canada do.</p><p>BAIER: Election upcoming. Let's turn to something more substantive, Ari, and take a listen to Bibi Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, and they are tied essentially in Israel, and there may be another election. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER CANDIDATE (through translator): I want an intent to set abroad a liberal unity government headed by me, a government that will manifest the will of the people and our promises to the public.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Benny, it's up to us to form a broad unity government today. The people are expecting from both of us to show responsibility to work together. And therefore, I tell you, Benny, let's meet today and any time to move this forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So the challenge, Ari, is to form this government, and just talk to somebody about the importance of what this means, if this leadership changes, or what it means for the U.S.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Well, two points, Bret. Number one, in terms of Israeli politics and what comes next, it is now a game of maneuvers. In order to get 61 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, you start cutting deals with everybody left, right, center, up and down. And political ideology in Israel becomes real flexible. People start forming alliances with groups that they hate if it will get them there 61 votes, and that's what's happening behind the scenes now. Both parties are doing it, Blue and White among with Likud, Netanyahu's Likud, Benny's Blue and White.</p><p>In terms of what the implications are, especially in America, if anybody in America is thinking getting rid of Netanyahu is going to lead to a different Israeli defense policy or foreign policy or security policy or that they will renegotiate the deal with Iran or they will be a coming out for a two-state solution, forget it. There is little difference between Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu when it comes to security positions. Bibi is seen as tougher, he's been reviled by the press. But any American who expects a big difference on those foreign policy issues, this election is not about that.</p><p>BAIER: Netanyahu is not, Jonah, coming to the U.N. General Assembly, obviously trying to form this coalition government and stay the leader. Meantime, President Trump was asked about it and said the U.S. is friends with Israel, even after a very close friendship with Bibi Netanyahu.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I think his exact statement was our relationship is with Israel and not just Netanyahu, and I think that's the exact correct thing for Donald Trump to say. And one of the reasons why I agree with almost everything Ari says about this, one of the reasons why this is so hard, though, to form this coalition is that the Blue and White Party is actually basically just an anti-Netanyahu coalition. It is not really -- it is still -- it's got liberal members, but there's a broad consensus around a lot of these policies in Israel. There's just an enormous amount of Netanyahu fatigue. We don't see that in America because Bibi Netanyahu, particularly among Republicans, is very, very popular, but he's been around for an enormous amount of time in Israeli politics, longest-serving prime minister, and a lot of people are just sick of him. He's got some corruption issues. I think some of that is unfair. And so it just makes it very difficult for Benny Gantz to agree when his singular issue was getting Netanyahu out of their to serve under another Netanyahu prime ministership.</p><p>BAIER: Leslie, I owe some time next time.</p><p>MARSHALL: OK.</p><p>BAIER: Panel, thank you very much. When we come back, you are never too old to follow your dreams or relive the good old days.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, one jump at a time, you're never too old to jump out of a perfectly good airplane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you ready?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: World War II veteran Tom Rice is another step closer to his goal of leaping out of planes at the age of 100. The 98-year-old caused a sensation in June by parachuting into Normandy for the 75th anniversary of D-Day. This time his landing zone was in the Netherlands, and he described the jump as perfect.

The last three weeks have been humbling ones for tech companies, especially the big four (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet or FANG) which seemed unstoppable in their pursuit of revenues and ever-rising market capitalizations, and for tech investors, many of whom seem to have mistaken luck for skill. Not surprisingly, some of the cheerleaders who were just a short while ago telling us that nothing could go wrong with these companies are in the midst of a mood shift, where they are convinced that nothing can go right with them. As Mark Zuckerberg gets ready to testify to Congress, amidst calls for both regulating and perhaps even breaking up tech companies, it is time to take a sober look at where we stand with these companies, what the last three weeks have changed and the consequences for investment decisions.The Rise of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FANG) The outsized attention paid to the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stocks sometimes obscures how young these companies are in the public market place. </p><p>Amazon, a company that I valued as an online, book retailer in 1998, a year after its listing, is the granddaddy of the group. The Google IPO , remembered primarily because of its use of a Dutch auction, instead of a banker, to set its offering price was in 2004, but you probably completely missed the Netflix IPO two years earlier in 2002, and Facebook, the youngest of the four, went public in 2012. The growth in market capitalization at these companies is the stuff of investing legend and the table below shows how they have almost tripled their contribution to the overall market capitalization of the S...00 between 2012 and 2017 (with all numbers in billions of US $): <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WBuITzF4rCg/WsgTulqvQOI/AAAAAAAAE_U/HIcJZkX_nKgO3BYHWEO8f3U611wviHn4QCLcBGAs/s1600/riseofFANGtable.pngAt\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WBuITzF4rCg/WsgTulqvQOI/AAAAAAAAE_U/HIcJZkX_nKgO3BYHWEO8f3U611wviHn4QCLcBGAs/s1600/riseofFANGtable.pngAt</url> the end of the 2017, Amazon, Google and Facebook were three of the ten largest market capitalization companies in the world. The role that the FANG companies have played in driving US equities can be best seen with a different lens, by looking at the total change in the market capitalization of the S...00 and how much of that change can be attributed to the rising values of just these four companies:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8WRdXn8_Hao/WsVqiRK2ReI/AAAAAAAAE-U/X-VcMR8DTEISYMcUXrJaS819g-SZrwJ6gCEwYBhgL/s1600/FANGchmktcapchart.png\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8WRdXn8_Hao/WsVqiRK2ReI/AAAAAAAAE-U/X-VcMR8DTEISYMcUXrJaS819g-SZrwJ6gCEwYBhgL/s1600/FANGchmktcapchart.png</url> To add weightto these numbers, consider these facts. The four companies that comprise FANG added almost $1.7 trillion in market capitalization over these five years and accounted for one-sixth of the increase in value for the entire index. Put simply, if you were a large-cap US portfolio manager and you held none of these stocks between 2013-2017, it would have been very, very difficult, if not impossible, to beat the S...00 over this period.A Reversal in Fortunes for the FANG stocks It is the sustained success of these companies that has made the last few weeks so trying for investors in them and so unsettling for market watchers. While these stocks went through the same ups and downs that the rest of the market was going through in February, it was in the middle of March that they became the central story, with the revelations from Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics and consulting firm, that they had harvested data on about 50 million Facebook users (a number that has since been increased to 87 million) for use in political and commercial campaigns. The political firestorm that followed has not only hurt Facebook, but the other three companies as well, and the graph below chronicles the damage in the days since the news story, since the news story was released:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mXszeIWCFpY/WsatKxLoTZI/AAAAAAAAE-k/YmNw-uJXuyAkZo8GkkflV5iL-ua0C6MUwCLcBGAs/s1600/PullbackChart.pngThe\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mXszeIWCFpY/WsatKxLoTZI/AAAAAAAAE-k/YmNw-uJXuyAkZo8GkkflV5iL-ua0C6MUwCLcBGAs/s1600/PullbackChart.pngThe</url> numbers are staggering, at least in absolute terms. Collectively, the FANG stocks lost $282 billion in market capitalization between March 15 and April 2 and contributed significantly to the drop in US equity markets over that period. To put that in perspective, the market capitalization lost in just these four companies in about two weeks was greater than the total value all crypto currencies (Bitcoin and all its relatives) as of the start of April of 2018, perhaps suggesting that we have been letting ourselves get distracted by penny change, when dollars are at stake. It is also interesting that while much of the attention has been directed at Facebook, which lost 15% of its value in just over two weeks, the three other stocks each lost about 12% of their value.Speaking of perspective, though, investors in these four stocks should consider another fact before they complain too much about being punished by the market. Even with the losses through April 2 incorporated, the collective market value of these companies remains about $400 billion higher than it was a year ago, on April 3, 2017.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XK1BaTKwM1s/WsatXUfDUCI/AAAAAAAAE-o/aTaLn5Qa5SABbNVGqfHuDdOKTPTZrTrXgCLcBGAs/s1600/Perspective%2BChart.pngThe\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XK1BaTKwM1s/WsatXUfDUCI/AAAAAAAAE-o/aTaLn5Qa5SABbNVGqfHuDdOKTPTZrTrXgCLcBGAs/s1600/Perspective%2BChart.pngThe</url> bottom line is that two weeks of market pull backs cannot take away from the longer term success at these companies. If this is what failure looks like, I would love to see more of it in my portfolio.The Fang Story Line To understand both the rise and recent pullback, let's look at what these four companies have in common. As I see it, here are the salient features: Scaling Success: Each of these companies has been able to keep revenue growing rapidly, even as they scale up and acquire larger market share. In effect, they have been able to deliver small company growth rates, while becoming monoliths.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cJGrmZY0rJc/Wsfl5pCPzaI/AAAAAAAAE-8/XnR5pn1Hm54TL2Wr1lzi7r48o2SbfTUTwCLcBGAs/s1600/FANGScalingTable.pngThis\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cJGrmZY0rJc/Wsfl5pCPzaI/AAAAAAAAE-8/XnR5pn1Hm54TL2Wr1lzi7r48o2SbfTUTwCLcBGAs/s1600/FANGScalingTable.pngThis</url> success of these companies at delivering high growth, as they have become bigger, have some led some to rethink long-held beliefs about the limits of growth[1].Bigger Slice of a Bigger Pie: All four of these companies have also been able to change the businesses that they have entered, increasing the size of the total market by attracting new customers, while also changing the way business is run to their benefit. With Google and Facebook, that business is advertising, with Netflix, it is entertainment, and with Amazon, it is just about any business it enters, from retailing to entertainment to cloud services. In each of these businesses, they have not only made the pie bigger but also increased their slice of it, quite a feat! Promise of Profitability: Alphabet and Facebook are money-making machines, with very high profit margins; Facebook's margins are among the highest among large market capitalization companies and Google's are in the top decile.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p2QiO2GNvh8/WsfmForsrTI/AAAAAAAAE_A/IaHL9ikuHlUltzFtTbcSFpY1dfXGJL-tQCLcBGAs/s1600/Profitability.pngAmazon\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p2QiO2GNvh8/WsfmForsrTI/AAAAAAAAE_A/IaHL9ikuHlUltzFtTbcSFpY1dfXGJL-tQCLcBGAs/s1600/Profitability.pngAmazon</url> has lagged on profitability historically, but it seems to be showing progress in the last few years, and Netflix still struggles to generate decent profit margins. The low margins that these companies show are deceptively low because they are after expensing what would be business building or capital expenditures in most other companies - $22.6 billion in technology and content at Amazon and almost $8 billion in content costs at Netflix. If, in 2008, you had described the trajectories that these companies would go through, to get to where they are today, I would have given you long odds on it happening. To the question of how they pulled it off, I would point to three factors; Centralized Power: These companies are more corporate dictatorships, than corporate democracies. All four of these companies continue to be run by founder/CEOs, whose visions and narratives have focused these companies; Brin and Page, at Alphabet, Zuckerberg, at Facebook, Bezos at Amazon and Hastings at Netflix, have unchallenged power at these companies, and the only option that shareholders who disagree with them have is to sell and move on. Big Data: While big data is often a buzz word thrown into conversations where it does not belong, these four companies epitomize how data can be used to create value. In fact, you can argue that what Google learns from our search behavior, Facebook from our social media interactions, Netflix from our video watching choices and Amazon from our shopping carts (and Alexa) is central to these companies being able to scale up successfully and change the businesses they are in. Google and Facebook use what they learn about us to allow companies to target their advertising, Netflix develops content that reflects our watching preferences and Amazon uses our shopping history and Prime membership to run circles around its competitors. Intimidation Factor: There is one final intangible in the mix and that is the perception that these companies have created in regulators, customers and competitors that they are unstoppable. Advertisers facing off against Google and Facebook increasingly settle for crumbs off the table, convinced that they cannot take on either company frontally, the entertainment business which once viewed Netflix as a nuisance has learned not only to live with the company but has adapted itself to the streaming world and Amazon's entry into almost any business seems to lead to a negative reassessment of the status quo in that business[2]. In short, if you were an investor in any of these companies until three weeks ago, the story that you would have used to justify holding them would have been that they were juggernauts headed for global domination, and valued accordingly.Story Break, Recalibration or Tweak? If you have read my prior posts on valuation, you know that I am a great believer that stories hold together valuations, and that it is changes to stories that change valuation. It is still early, but the question that investors face is whether what has happened in the last three weeks has changed the story dynamics fundamentally at these companies. At the very minimum, we have at least noticed that the strengths that we noted in the last section come with accompanying weaknessesCEO heads cannot roll: Unlike traditional companies facing crises, where CEOs can be offered by a board of director as a sacrificial offering to calm investors, regulators or politicians, the FANG companies and their CEOs are so intertwined, with power entrenched in the current CEOs, this option is off the table. Even if Mark Zuckerberg performs like Valeant's Michael Pearson did[3] in front of a congressional committee next week, he will still be CEO for the foreseeable future, an advantage that having voting shares and controlling more than 50% of the voting rights gives him. The Dark Side of Sharing: I don't know what we, collectively as users of these companies' products and services, thought they were doing with all of the information that we were sharing so willingly with them, but until the last few weeks, we were able to look the other way and assume that it would be used benevolently. The Facebook fiasco with Cambridge Analytica has pushed some of us out of denial and perhaps into a reassessment of how we share data and how that data is used. It has also created a firestorm about data sharing and privacy that may result in restrictions in how the data gets used. No Friends: When other companies feel threatened by your success and growth, it should come as no surprise that many of them are cheering, as you stumble. From Elon Musk shutting down Tesla's Facebook presence[4]] to Tim Cook castigating Google and Facebook[5] for misusing data, there seems to be a desire to pile on. Musk has far bigger problems at Tesla than it's Facebook page, and Cook should be careful about throwing stones from a glass house, but watching the FANG companies squirm is evoking joy in the boardrooms of its competitors. So, what now? As I see it, there are three ways to read the tea leaves, with theeffects on value ranging from very negativeto non-existent.Second Thoughts on Sharing: It is possible that the news stories about how exposed we have left ourselves, as a consequence of our sharing, will lead us to all to reassess how much and how we interact online. That would have significant consequences for all of the FANG stocks, since their scaling success and business models depend upon continued user engagement. Tempest in a teapot: At the other end of the spectrum, there are some who argue that after the Zuckerberg testimony, the story will blow over and that not only will the companies revert back to their old ways, but that they will continue to accumulate users and grow revenues, while doing so. Data Protections: The third possibility lies somewhere between the first two. While the news stories may have little effect on how people use these companies' products and services, there may be new restrictions on how the data that is collected from their usage is utilized by the companies. That would include not only privacy restrictions, similar to those already in place in the EU, but also regulations on how the data is collected, stored and shared. In addition, the companies themselves may feel pressure to change current business practices, which while profitable, have left data vulnerabilities.I don't buy into either of the first two scenarios. I think that we are too far gone down the sharing road to reverse field, and that while we will have a few high profile individuals signal their displeasure by abandoning (or claiming to abandon) a platform, most of us are too attached to Google search, our Facebook friends, watching Black Mirror on Netflix and the convenience of Prime to throw them overboard, because our privacy has been breached. In fact, I would not be surprised if Facebook usage has gone up in the days since the crisis, rather than down.I also think that assuming that these stories will pass with no effect is a mistake, since there are changes coming to these firms, from within and without, that will have value consequences. To illustrate, Facebook has already announced that it will stop using data from third party aggregators to supplement its own data in customer targeting, because of data concerns, and I am sure that there are more changes coming, many of which will increase Facebook's costs and crimp revenue growth, and through those changes, the value that we attach to Facebook. I also believe that you will see more restrictions on the use of data and that these rules will also have an effect on costs, growth and value. Rather than extend this post further, by looking at the impact of these changes, I will be using my next post to update my stories and valuations of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. If you want a preview, suffice to say that I am back to being a Facebook shareholder, that I am close to becoming a Google shareholder for the first time and that Amazon and Netflix remain out of my reach.YouTube VideoPlay Video[6]Blog Posts on Tech Takedown Come easy, go easy: The Tech Takedown!

The new decade in this age of technology, without a doubt, would be something out of the futuristic movies we saw back in the '90s. We can proudly say that the future is finally here. So, without further ado, here are the several tech trend predictions that we have gathered for the year 2020. Cybersecurity is taking a new level Cybersecurity's narrative has always been led by the 'fear of breach' more than any other potential facets it has in store. This was largely due to multiple global incidents that we have seen on the news; one being the infamous case of misleading posts to be approved and circulated on Facebook as ads targeted to its billions of users. </p><p>But 2020 will be the beginning of a change in narrative for cybersecurity. We can expect to 'see an increased focus on cyber resilience and how the availability and integrity of systems and data underpin the digital organisations many institutions have become', as Richard Watson, EY Asia-Pacific Cybersecurity Risk Advisory Leader, shares. According to recently released EY's The Forrester Wave: Cybersecurity Consulting Services In Asia Pacific[1], organisations will keep a close eye on how regulators will respond to those big cyber incidents following the go-live of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Harsh punishments and penalties will prompt Asia Pacific companies to get an understanding of their GDPR readiness posture. Also Read: Welcoming 2020: How IoT will transform everything enterprises know today[2] With 5G is on the horizon for some Asian countries, multi-cloud and IoT adoption is expected to follow suit -and not without security risks. According to Sandeep Bhargava, Managing Director of Asia Pacific/Japan, Rackspace, besides providing a wider potential attack surface for hackers, multi-cloud can also cause organisations to be more vulnerable to insider threats. 'For instance, the increased complexity of the IT environment due to multi-cloud adoption might lead to poor configuration management. Having more business users using the cloud also poses a challenge as not everyone fully understands cloud security risks and knows how to mitigate them,' Bhargava adds. A recent report by Symantec found that some users may exhibit risky behaviours in the cloud such as oversharing cloud files or not storing sensitive data properly in the cloud - all of which may lead to data loss. Rackspace[3] added that to minimise cloud risks, organisations will need to have a multi-layered security strategy that can provide detection, response, and remediation when their IT environment is in jeopardy. Their Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) will also need to work across more departments in 2020 to ensure that security is not overlooked when innovative solutions and new business processes are introduced. More people will recognise the value of cryptocurrency On a related note, Facebook could eventually launch its digital currency Libra in 2020. Watson adds, 'I think this has a great historical significance and may even become a landmark of the blockchain industry. Libra has established a relatively positive image for the blockchain industry in the short term.' Libra has managed to reduce the regulatory pressure on the entire industry to some extent and has also improved the working environment of the blockchain industry. With Facebook's large user base in the internet industry, Libra has the potential to bring a large number of new users to the blockchain industry. Libra can also be regarded as a type of stablecoins. In addition to that, Central Bank digital currencies could eventually become a reality in the near future. Approaching this possibility with a positive mentality, Central Bank digital currencies in themselves are also types of stablecoins. Compared to traditional banks and fiat currencies, blockchain-based stablecoins can make payments faster, cheaper, and smoother, which is also one of the main applications of blockchain. 'It shows the recognition of blockchain at the national level, which is positive for the industry, and more people will realise the value of cryptocurrencies,' said Haipo Yang, CoinEx's CEO, in an interview[4] with LearnBonds. When it comes to Bitcoin, the concept remains working as before with a rising price. However, Bitcoin's higher portion of total crypto market capitalisation means that other currencies are lacking attention and their prices are falling, which is the signal of a bear market. In contrast, the lower the Bitcoin's portion, the hotter the overall cryptocurrency market. 'So in my point of view, the alt season will only come when Bitcoin's portion begins to drop,' said Yang. Decentralised peer-to-peer Exchange (DEX) to become more significant Decentralised peer-to-peer Exchange (DEX) is an exchange run by code that exists as a decentralised application (DApp). It is a place where people can trade cryptocurrencies directly without a middleman. According to Yang, at present, almost all blockchain exchanges are centralised, which is believed to be the biggest bug in this field. 'Blockchains are known for decentralisation, but the entire ecosystem is heavily dependent on centralised exchanges, which is ironic,' Yang added. Also Read: How China's Greater Bay Area initiative will create a testbed for AI and decentralised tech industry[5] DEX is clearly the evolutionary direction of the blockchain exchange, and DEX will reshape the exchange industry through decentralisation. In DEX, users are in charge of their own private keys. DEX can support the issuance and trading of thousands or even more tokens to meet the needs of future industry development. 'Through decentralised governance and operation, DEX has no single point of failure and takes on more vitality,' said Yang. 5G and its new tech implications The year 2020 will be the moment for 5G to play and stay. It is necessary to complement IoT advancements, as Watson points out. '5G itself is an attractive asset for telecom operators to offer with enterprises that have started to invest in the technology.' '5G will lead to a rapid increase in the number of connected devices and will lower latency, therefore augmenting the capabilities that IoT offers,' Watson adds. The presence of 5G, simultaneously, will also become solutions in the area of cybersecurity such as using AI for cyber strategy in monitoring regular management of newly introduced technology, as well as assess the cyber-physical risks they could bring. It can also create more resilient technology platforms that have the ability to predict attacks before they occur. To date, South Korea and China have rolled out 5G networks, while Australia, Japan, and Singapore plans to do so next year, in predictions shared by Rackspace. 5G rollout will be beneficial especially for the manufacturing, retail, transportation, and government sectors, as they adopt IoT to become more connected. 5G's low-latency, high bandwidth network will enable far-away sensors to instantly share updates about the connected devices, therefore enabling real-time processing. 'This will, in turn, drive the demand for edge computing as data can be immediately processed near where the data is generated, instead of in a centralised data-processing warehouse. Edge computing can also help reduce operational costs. It reduces the bandwidth needs as data is mostly processed locally, and only the relevant data gets transmitted to the central data repository,' says Bhargava. Also Read: Mobile is the US$120B future of tech business, report by App Annie[6] Another sector that may benefit from the arrival of 5G is video games. Watson also shares that cloud gaming and 5G technology represents an opportunity for the industry as companies can harness these new technologies to edge out competitors to prevent slowing growth. 'There has been an increase in expenditure on boosting cybersecurity compliance, as well as in the tech infrastructure needed to support blockchain is being utilised as a solution to encourage trust throughout the video gaming ecosystem,' says Watson based on the result of a survey conducted by EY. All-cloud data storage and its management More businesses will shift their operations to the cloud and deploy data-intensive workloads with higher supercomputing footprint. According to Pure Storage[7]'s predictions, to support these workloads, more renewable forms of data sustainability and emerging techniques will arise to make processing more energy efficient. However, as applications are developed or re-platformed for cloud-friendly architectures, Object Storage will become the natural choice for enabling applications to decouple and disaggregate applications and their computed resources from a pool of shared storage. Still from Pure Storage[8]'s predictions, subscription business models will see a spike in the new decade. In addition to that, fueling the growth for modern analytics will become more affordable infrastructure options such as more powerful CPUs, consumption-based infrastructure, available both on-prem and in the public cloud, and lower-priced flash memory. 'The unbridled growth of data sources including smart devices (smart home, wearables, connected cars, industrial internet, etc.) will drive the adoption of modern analytics in order to drive more insights,' said Matthew Oostveen, Chief Technology Officer, Asia Pacific ...pan, Pure Storage[9]. All in all, multi-cloud will become the preferred IT foundation for more organisations as they seek to become more agile to keep up with the digital disruption. 'For multi-cloud to deliver value, it needs to be integrated, support DevOps, and scale services to meet variable workload demands. Recognising this, some cloud giants have introduced solutions - such as AWS Outpost, Azure Arc, and Google Anthos - that can ensure consistent development and operations experience across on-premise, private and public clouds,' Bhargava adds. As the competition among cloud hyperscalers to become the provider of choice heats up, the team at Rackspace[10] believes that more of such unified, hybrid/multi-cloud tools will be rolled out next year. AI-driven everything Pure Storage[11] also added that AI will go from advisory roles to an automated action as customers want to take the backseat. 'Organisations will be more open to AI making decisions for them,' Oostveen added. Ronen Mense, President ...naging Director, APAC at AppsFlyer added: 'We are finally going to see some solid impact out of Artificial and Augmented Intelligence. It may possibly be first felt in the logistics and supply chain sector, paving the way for a new category called Logitech (not to be confused with the brand).' Singapore, for example, has geared up with its National AI Strategy[12], publicly announced during the Singapore Fintech Festival in November. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat shared that the new strategy details how Singapore is set to develop and use AI to transform the economy and improve peoples' lives. Also Read: Infographic: Why the future of consumer goods lies in the use of AI[13] 'The government has committed more than S$500 million (US$368 million) to fund AI activities under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan,' Heng said. The launch of the latest national AI strategy targeted at developing the AI ecosystem in Singapore is a part of the nation's ongoing Smart Nation initiative. Singapore will embark on the plan by kickstarting projects in key high-value sectors and building a holistic AI ecosystem. The National AI Strategy has three objectives that include Singapore becoming a global hub for developing, test-bedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions, as well as learning how to govern and manage the impact of AI. With Singapore as APAC's corridor pledged to be an 'AI-fied' nation, we can only imagine what would entail for the rest of the region in the next decade.Early-stage funding on the riseWe are going to see more early-stage funding round being announced in the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem, particularly seed funding news. At least, this is the direction that we began to see towards the end of this year. In the various interviews that e27 has done this year, we have seen investors expressing their interest in focussing on early-stage investments. The latest of such kind of conversation was this one we had[14] with Vertex Holdings on their new fund; CEO Chua Kee Lock stated that early-stage investing 'will remain a robust asset class for the foreseeable future.' The privacy-led customer journey for Gen Z There are also other digital spheres that we think may see growth, such as the use of hyper-personalisation technology and the rise of a new era of social media such as TikTok, driven by its vast users, Generation Z. We need to also factor that the next decade will see Generations Z as the dominant consumers that grow with technology and grown by technology, with them entering multiple stages of their lives, forcing products and services to adjust to their needs. 'With 2019 became a milestone year for data privacy and transparency, many big tech players introduced features that give consumers more control over how and when their data is collected and used. To capitalise on the positive impact this has on consumers, we can expect brands, marketers, and developers to increasingly look beyond their traditional marketing tech stack to inform their 2020 campaigns and business objectives with anonymised data throughout the customer journey,' Mense adds. Mobile gaming reaches a new height of quality Besides Gen Z leading the way, mobile gaming is another big disruptor this year that is predicted to continue to gain massive popularity for the coming years. In the State of Gaming App Marketing 2019[15] report released by AppsFlyer, it is stated that hyper-casual will make way for hybrid-casual mobile games, as players demand better quality and deeper gameplay, which means fewer ads and players are willing to pay for the experience. The report also shared the potential of India as the next big frontier. It already has the building blocks such as a massive young population; smartphone penetration expected to reach 32 per cent in 2020; cheapest, accessible mobile data; and with more than 200 homegrown world-class gaming studios making India their home.

'Traditional institutions will be scrambling if they aren't already. Those who don't keep up will be left behind in the new decade,' Mense adds. To close up the predictions, Mense says, 'There has been a consolidation of media sources in the past 24 months with inefficient players unable to be competitive with the big players. We have reached an inflex point where the industry will start to open up, kind of like an hourglass, and we will see the likes of Bytedance, Amazon and true programmatic step up and fill the dire need of the market to be more competitive and cost-efficient.' - Image Credit:Jon Tyson[17]onUnsplash[18] The post As we enter 2020, these are the tech trends that have been predicted to rule the next decade[19] appeared first on e27[20].

Tesla shares have more than quadrupled in value this year, making them one of the market's biggest success stories in 2020.</p><p>In overseas stocks, the Stoxx Europe 600 gauge edged up 0.3 per cent as an advance in shares of basic-resource companies balanced a decline in travel and banking stocks.</p><p>Shares in Asia were broadly higher. The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 2.3 per cent after the People's Bank of China injected 700 billion yuan ($US101 billion) into the banking system via its medium-term lending facility. The move could pave the way for lower benchmark lending rates.</p><p>But Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 per cent after data showed the Japanese economy endured its worst contraction on record in the second quarter. Gross domestic product fell 7.8 per cent in the three months through June compared with the previous quarter, the biggest decline since at least 1980.</p><p>Futures on Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, climbed 1.3 per cent to settle at $US45.37 a barrel. Later this week, ministers from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are set to review compliance with production cuts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dow Jones Newswires</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.00am:</emphasis>Citi sues, seeks return of 'mistaken' payment            </p><p>Citigroup has filed a lawsuit against Brigade Capital Management LP, seeking the return of the hedge-fund manager's share of nearly $US900 million payment that Citi said it paid by mistake to Revlon lenders.</p><p>Brigade \"has unlawfully attempted to capitalise on the mistaken payment, \" Citi said in the complaint, filed in New York federal court on Monday.

The fast-food giant said in the lawsuit last week that it has since concluded that Mr. Easterbrook lied to investigators and its board to cover up relationships with employees to secure a multimillion-dollar severance package.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dow Jones</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.40am:</emphasis>               Gold surges 2.5pc            </p><p>Gold prices rallied Monday, with the gain helping the precious commodity put in the best one-day gain in about four months on the back of a slide in government bond yields and the U.S. dollar, which were raising the appeal of the precious commodity. </p><p>The yellow metal also may have drawn additional interest after a public filing that offered a peek of holdings of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed that the conglomerate had taken a new stake last quarter in the world's second-largest gold miner, Barrick Gold Corp.</p><p>December gold rose $US48.90, or 2.5pc, to settle at $US1998.70 an ounce.</p><p>On a dollar and percentage basis that marks the best day for gold since April 22, FactSet data show. </p><p>Last week, gold came under pressure as US Treasurys climbed to an eight-week high, detracting from the appeal of bullion.

due to COVID restrictions in a number of EU countries,\" the no-frills carrier said in a statement.</p><p>Ryanair said the cuts to flights \"will be heavily focused on those countries such as Spain, France and Sweden, where rising recent COVID case rates have led to increased travel restrictions\".</p><p>The reduction will also hit Ireland, as the country has imposed 14-day quarantines on

Santos first submitted its environmental impact statement for the development in February 2017. </p><p>While the IPC may approve the project with conditions, according to Mr Kean, the bigger question is whether the energy producer will sanction the facility given his view that gas may prove a poor investment in the long term.</p><p>\"I just think it's a big gamble for them, particularly in this environment,\" Mr Kean told The Australian. </p><p>\"You only need to look at capital and investment cycles. Already we're seeing people getting out of fossil fuels and that will only increase. </p><p>\"There will still be a market for gas for a long time, but will it be as big a market?

temporary closure of all 60 locations and resulted in the retailer's second-largest loss in its history. </p><p>According to the 2020 annual report released Tuesday, CEO John King received total remuneration of $1,591,275 - a near 15 per cent decrease on the $1.864m he received in 2019. </p><p>The decrease was driven by a reduction in both Mr King's base salary and share-based payments. </p><p>Chairman Gary Hounsell saw his chairman's fee slashed from $300,000 to $250,000 and no executives were awarded under the FY2020 short term incentives scheme or vested their awards under the FY18 long term incentives plan. </p><p>In a joint report, Mr King and Mr Hounsell said that as part of a prudent cost management strategy, executive pay was frozen and for a period, executives worked without accessing their base salary. </p><p>\"For a period during April, when all stores were closed due to COVID-19, the Executive Management Team elected to either forego their base salaries, or accessing their existing leave entitlements, and the Chairman and other non-executive directors elected to forego their director's fees,\" they said. </p><p>\"Additionally, for a period in May and June, the Executive Management Team elected to work at reduced base salaries and the Non-Executive Directors elected to receive reduced Director fees.\" </p><p>The lockdown of all stores greatly impacted Myer's operations, resulting in total sales falling 15 per cent to $2.5bn and a net loss of $172.5m. </p><p>However, online sales increased by 61.1 per cent to $422.5 million as Australians flocked to online shopping during lockdown. </p><p>Mr King and Mr Hounsell said the stand out categories online were cosmetics, up 218 per cent and homewares, up 177 per cent. </p><p>The duo said that going forward Myer would continue to enhance its e-commerce offerings and online fulfillment and would continue to barter with landlords over lease commitments to further a $138.6m decline in the cost of doing business, a decline of 14 per cent. </p><p>However, the reduction in the cost of doing business was helped by the period when stores were shut and by Myer's qualification for JobKeeper and

Choice.</p><p>He notes that after the setbacks from the Royal Commission, the broking sector has resumed growth, amid an easing of responsible lending rules, a lift in borrowers' capital and record low rates.</p><p>Favourable demographics are expected to see 7pc per annum growth in finance commitments and mortgage brokers expected to win up to 60pc of total originations.</p><p>\"Over the next 10 years, we expect there will be a boom in households aged 35-54, the key demographic for 'house with a mortgage' demand,\" Mr Sproules says.</p><p>\"This demand will be met by the downsizing of the ageing 'Baby Boomer' population.\"</p><p>Moreover, mortgage brokers are expected to win market share as the lenders' branch-centric distribution is no longer aligned to consumer preferences.</p><p>And one of the major areas of cost reduction for a revenue constrained sector is the transformation of branch networks, to the benefit of independent mortgage brokers.</p><p>\"Mortgage brokers' growing strength is set to be better monetised and they increase revenue through the shift to increasingly fund own-branded mortgages through securitisation,\" Mr Sproules says.</p><p>Australian Finance Group

economic surprises and record earnings beats in the last few months was never going to maintain its heady pace forever.</p><p>The September sell-off may have eased some concerns surrounding overcrowded positioning in some sectors, but a recovery may take longer to eventuate given the pace of the rally this year, lingering concerns around market concentration and the US Presidential

Benchmark futures are up more than 11 per cent in 2017, after going into a bull market in September. West Texas Intermediate for February delivery was at $US60.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 31??. While gains were driven by glut-shrinking output cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, geopolitical tensions as well as pipeline disruptions from the North Sea to Canada and Libya have also helped. In 2018, investors will watch if US output undermines OPEC's curbs.</p><p>Stock watch: NextDC Limited</p><p>The data centre operator is recommended as a \"buy\" by Citi, which reaffirmed its confidence in NextDC's outlook upon the company reporting the fastest build rate to date at its S2 site in Sydney in an update last week. It has already received orders for more than 5MW of capacity, in what will be a 30MW facility once fully built. Shares of NextDC were trading at $6.09 on Friday. Citi observes that client demand is strong and expects a quick uptake of the new capacity, albeit with risks to client usage and biling. NextDC also holds a 29.2 per cent interest in Asia Pacific Data Centre Group.</p><p>With Reuters and Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1028447352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8Y-B6N1-DY19-C28J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><timeReceived>04:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

West Texas Intermediate for February delivery was at $US60.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 31??. While gains were driven by glut-shrinking output cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, geopolitical tensions as well as pipeline disruptions from the North Sea to Canada and Libya have also helped.

It has already received orders for more than 5MW of capacity, in what will be a 30MW facility once fully built. Shares of NextDC were trading at $6.09 on Friday. Citi observes that client demand is strong and expects a quick uptake of the new capacity, albeit with risks to client usage and billing. NextDC also holds a 29.2 per cent interest in Asia Pacific Data Centre Group.</p><p>With Reuters and Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1028447352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8Y-GPW1-JBJ7-N2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><timeReceived>04:55 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

This [will be] little ASX in Australia competing with the global behemoths that are IBM, Microsoft, and other big tech players who provide blockchain-as-a-service,\" ASX equity post trade executive general manager Cliff Richards said.</p><p>\"We're the underdog here.\"</p><p>However, such competition will not be enough to deter the ASX from allowing third parties to develop applications and host them on its blockchain-based platform when its built, according to Richards.</p><p>\"We're fancying ourselves as being able to deliver better value,\" he said, touting that the long-standing trust the market has in the organisation to not do \"anything dodgy\" will give it the competitive advantage.</p><p>\"Because we're trusted, we're recognised, brands are understood, and we're adults in the room. We're not hysterical. We've kept markets going for one and a half centuries,\" he continued.</p><p>Read more: Here's what to expect from ASX's blockchain-based CHESS replacement</p><p>While Richards admits some have accused the new offering as a sign of the ASX abusing its \"privileged monopoly position\", he contends there is nothing stopping others from competing with the organisation, \"they've just got to stump up the money and build a competing service\".</p><p>\"The monopoly we have here is because we just happen to be the only organisation providing clearing and settlement services to the stock market in Australia. Anyone can come and compete. If that's so lucrative, where are they?\" he said.</p><p>He speculated that no one has attempted to compete against the ASX because it's doesn't make economic sense.</p><p>\"I'd say why would you? It's not a lot of money -- AU$50 million from settlement. But what we've seen is when the market said, 'The cost structures in financial markets are killing us, can you do anything to assist?' We've gone, 'Yes, we believe we can',\" Richards said.</p><p>\"In replacing [CHESS], we can take this infrastructure and make it available to the rest of the market, and the rest of the market can bring innovation to the equation.\"</p><p>And if ASX's plan to become a blockchain service provider doesn't work out, Richards reckons there'll be no loss.</p><p>\"We've replaced CHESS with a system for the next 20-odd years that's operating on global standards, has functions that have been requested by the market  the market is way better off,\" he said.</p><p>When ZDNet asked whether the market would be ready for the launch of the blockchain-based platform, Richard said \"the market is highly engaged now\".</p><p>\"We have 31 participants in our development environment, so not the testing environment  The asset testing will kick off in the middle of next year when we open up phaseable industry-wide testing,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's where all the participants will need to start to connect and prove to us their dependent systems can perform functions that their licensing obligation requires them to.\"</p><p>See also: Blockchain: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic)</p><p>But the ASX is not alone when it comes to adopting blockchain for clearing and settlement. Richards said counterparts in Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States, and European Union are exploring the use of the technology as well.</p><p>\"Blockchain will get adoption in the same way any other technology gets adoption,\" he said.</p><p>ASX's speedy adoption of blockchain technology -- a process that started in June 2016 -- was sparked by what Richards referred to as \"symmetry alignment\".</p><p>\"Australia has a relatively unfragmented market, on a relative basis. It's easier to get the market here, it's easier to have conversations with 100 participants, rather than thousands, which is the case in the US,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our regulators, we can get them into the room at the same time and have the conversation once, rather than having in the US 13 different conversations with federal regulators and then the same conversations with state regulators.</p><p>\"We are blessed with certain circumstances in Australia that have allowed us to move faster than other jurisdictions.\" 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-164141765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-SKK1-JDJN-611W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000A3M3</classCode><className>ASX LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523210 SECURITIES &amp;

Thursday (Friday AEST).</p><p>However some sectors of the economy have begun bouncing back, with retail and new home sales recovering from the coronavirus hit and data from the Commerce Department

The ASX200 was close behind, finishing the week at 6793.4, just below the pre-GFC record of 6828 points record.</p><p>With further monetary easing expected in the US, Europe and domestically, the market is expected to continue its firm run in the short term.</p><p>\"I'm still bullish on Aussie shares,\" Stanford Brown chief investment officer Ashley Owen said. \"Seven thousand [points] is not far away. It's a hop, skip and a jump away so I can say that being reached quite easily.\"</p><p>The Australian market is inextricably linked to overseas events, Mr Owen explained, with the US economy particularly relevant to whether the local market rise will continue.</p><p>\"Every single move is basically driven by what happens overseas,\" he said. \"In the US you've got massive monetary stimulus. You've got very low rates and talks of cuts.\"</p><p>Reserve Bank of Australia governor <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/rba-s-lowe-flags-extended-period-of-low-rates-20190725-p52ari\">Dr Philip Lowe said on Thursday that Australians should \"expect an extended period of low interest rates\",</url> increasing expectations the bank would cut at least once more before the year was out.</p><p>\"The RBA is encouraging people, economic participants - companies, individually investors, what have you - they want people to be able to put money into risky assets, whether it be investing in plant and equipment, or investing in equity markets,\" said Plato Investment Management managing director Don Hamson.</p><p>The low rate environment has resulted in share price growth that was not necessarily being linked to company performance, according to Dr Hamson.</p><p>\"I don't see earnings being fantastic at the moment. That's why rates are where they are.\"</p><p>BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese expects the rise in Australian shares to continue but said growth would not be the driving force.</p><p>\"I think what we're seeing is a bit of a build-up of equity markets that can really be sustained for the moment, because central banks are basically still focused on trying to get inflation,\" Mr Bassanese said. \"But it's going to be more driven on the back of low interest rates than a solid rebound in growth.</p><p>\"What we're essentially seeing is a repricing of the equity markets around the world, because of central bank easing.\"</p><p>Year-to-date gains for the benchmark index are now above 20 per cent, but there are risks that remain that will determine if the growth is sustained.</p><p>\"I think the China thing is years and years away, trade is only part of the picture, it's more about strategy. It's more about power, it's more about military dominance,\" Stanford Brown's Mr Owen said.</p><p>He believed there was also a bigger risk on the horizon in the form of regulatory intervention.</p><p>\"It's more the anti-trust movement against the big tech stocks, it's more of a medium-term concern,\" he said. \"I think what will happen within five years is you'll see the big US tech stocks broken up.\"</p><p>The significance of the big tech companies to the US market means breaking them could have a broader destabilising impact.</p><p>Mr Owen was still optimistic despite those risks and with the 7000-point threshold now in sight, another key level is further away. Adjusted for inflation, the pre-GFC high for the S&amp;P/ASX 200 is closer to 8800 points.</p><p>\"The big target, which is the after-inflation target, it's another 27 per cent, which is a long way away,\" Mr Owen said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520160182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-XRH1-JBJ7-N2R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><timeReceived>05:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The ASX200 was close behind, finishing the week at 6793.4, just below the pre-GFC record of 6828 points.</p><p>With further monetary easing expected in the United States, Europe and domestically, the market is expected to continue its firm run in the short term.</p><p>\"I'm still bullish on Aussie shares,\" Stanford Brown chief investment officer Ashley Owen said. \"Seven thousand [points] is not far away. It's a hop, skip and a jump away so I can see that being reached quite easily.\"</p><p>The Australian market is inextricably linked to overseas events, Mr Owen explained, with the US economy particularly relevant to whether the local market rise will continue.</p><p>\"Every single move is basically driven by what happens overseas,\" he said. \"In the US you've got massive monetary stimulus. You've got very low rates and talks of cuts.\"</p><p>Reserve Bank of Australia governor Dr Philip Lowe said on Thursday that Australians should \"expect an extended period of low interest rates\", increasing expectations the bank would cut at least once more before the year was out.</p><p>\"The RBA is encouraging people, economic participants - companies, individually investors, what have you - they want people to be able to put money into risky assets, whether it be investing in plant and equipment, or investing in equity markets,\" said Plato Investment Management managing director Don Hamson.</p><p>The low-rate environment has resulted in share price growth that was not necessarily being linked to company performance, said Dr Hamson.</p><p>\"I don't see earnings being fantastic at the moment. That's why rates are where they are,\" he said.</p><p>BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese expects the rise in Australian shares to continue, but said growth would not be the driving force.</p><p>\"I think what we're seeing is a bit of a build-up of equity markets that can really be sustained for the moment, because central banks are basically still focused on trying to get inflation,\" Mr Bassanese said. \"But it's going to be more driven on the back of low interest rates than a solid rebound in growth.</p><p>\"What we're essentially seeing is a re-pricing of the equity markets around the world, because of central bank easing.\"</p><p>Year-to-date gains for the benchmark index are now above 20 per cent, but there are risks that remain that will determine if the growth is sustained.</p><p>\"I think the China thing is years and years away - trade is only part of the picture, it's more about strategy. It's more about power, it's more about military dominance,\" Stanford Brown's Mr Owen said.</p><p>He believed there was also a bigger risk on the horizon in the form of regulatory intervention.</p><p>\"It's more the anti-trust movement against the Big Tech stocks, it's more of a medium-term concern,\" he said. \"I think what will happen within five years is you'll see the big US tech stocks broken up.\"</p><p>The significance of the Big Tech companies to the US market means breaking them could have a broader destabilising impact.</p><p>Mr Owen was still optimistic despite those risks and with the 7000-point threshold now in sight, another key level is further away. Adjusted for inflation, the pre-GFC high for the S&amp;P/ASX 200 is closer to 8800 points.</p><p>\"The big target, which is the after-inflation target, it's another 27 per cent, which is a long way away,\" Mr Owen said.</p><p>Key pointsWith further monetary easing expected, the market is set to continue its firm run.</p><p>Analysts say there are risks that will determine if the growth is sustained.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76dwrg0k9w8zn0xnbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-33N1-JD34-V00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Meanwhile, its gap over similar-maturity risk-free rates, known as the Libor-OIS spread, has more than doubled since the end of January to 55 basis points, a level unseen since 2009.</p><p>Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues will end up raising interest rates four times this year, but are unlikely to signal that intention at this week's policy meeting, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.</p><p>In a poll of 41 economists conducted by Bloomberg March 13-16, the median forecast predicted a quarter-point hike this week, plus similar moves in June and September and December.

For the week, CSI300 declined 2.9 per cent, while SSEC shed 2.8 per cent, both logging their worst week since late March.</p><p>Caution prevailed as worries persisted over the trade stand-off between China and the United States.</p><p>China's ZTE said on Friday a ban on the sale of parts and software to the company was unfair and threatens its survival, and vowed to safeguard its interests through all legal means. ZTE stock is still suspended in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The ZTE ban has ratchetted up tensions between China and the United States at a time when they have already threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs.</p><p>Hong Kong stocks ended down on Friday, as energy shares slumped from a two-month high hit in the previous session, while technology stocks tracked the Asian tech sector lower. The Hang Seng index ended down 0.9 per cent at 30,418.33, while the China Enterprises Index closed 1.5 per cent down at 12,054.23 points.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei share average edged lower on Friday morning as worries about slower smartphone demand hit technology shares, while financial stocks rallied thanks to higher US yields.</p><p>The Nikkei gave up 0.1 per cent to 22,162.24. The index rose 1.8 per cent for the week, its fourth straight week of gains.</p><p>Semiconductor equipment companies and electronic component makers underperformed after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world's largest contract chipmaker, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its previous forecast due to softer demand for smartphones.</p><p>Tokyo Electron tumbled 2.1 per cent, Advantest Corp declined 2.2 per cent, while Murata Manufacturing shed 2.0 per cent, TDK Corp fell 1.4 per cent and Alps Electric dropped 1.8 per cent.</p><p>Rising U.S. yields, however, benefited financials which are exposed to high-yielding products such as foreign bonds.

This rise in the long-end yields should take some more pressure off the curve-flattening trend.\"</p><p>The spread between 2- and 10-year yields has risen for three straight sessions, rebounding from just 41 basis points on Wednesday, the smallest gap in more than a decade. The spread was just shy of 50 basis points Friday.</p><p>Speculators' net short dollar position surged to the highest since August 2011 in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net short dollar position was $US23.42 billion in the week ended April 17, compared with net shorts of $US22.77 billion the previous week. Short-term investors have been short the dollar since mid-July last year.</p><p>\"There was not one, but four main catalysts for the US dollar's recovery this past week,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy, at BK Asset Management in New York. She cited the rise in Treasury yields, softer global data, solid US retail sales and a more upbeat Beige Book report, including a generally quiet environment on the geopolitical front. Investors were overall relieved that President Donald Trump did not escalate tensions in Syria after striking specific targets in that country, instead abandoning plans for more sanctions.</p><p>\"If President Trump stays relatively quiet, US data beats (forecasts) and 10-year Treasury yields edge closer to 3 per cent, the US dollar can extend its gains,\" Lien added.</p><p> Commodities </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/metals/go-long-commodities-ahead-of-global-economic-peak-20180418-h0yynv\">Go long commodities ahead of global economic peak</url>: Investors can still profit from some well-timed commodity bets, strategists say, even though some prices have overshot near term.</p><p>Chinese iron ore prices fell on Friday after a nearly 7-per cent jump in the previous session, ending their strongest week since December on expectations of rising demand for restocking at steel mills.</p><p>The most-active iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange eased 1 percent to 461 yuan ($US73.37) a tonne after a sharp rally in the previous session, but still marked their strongest weekly gain in 17 weeks.</p><p>\"The market has been in a party mood since the central bank said it was cutting (bank reserve requirements). On a fundamental basis, the market expects some restocking demand for raw materials since mills have incentives to churn out output amid fat margins,\" said a Shanghai-based iron ore trader.</p><p>Average output profits at steel mills are currently around 681 yuan a tonne in top steelmaking city Tangshan, according to Mysteel consultancy.</p><p>Construction rebar contracts for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 1.1 per cent to 3454 yuan a tonne.

More details could be announced this week. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Mr Trump appeared to be leaning towards a global tariff with no exemptions for any country.</p><p>Mr Trump made clear in two tweets on Friday in the US that he was going to \"protect\" the country. The tweets triggered yet more volatility in New York, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging near 400 points before paring most of the losses. Both the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended higher, erasing earlier losses.

Notwithstanding, decomposing market expectations, we find that energy markets have already discounted easing supply-side support. And, we continue to expect significant deficits on the horizon nonetheless.</p><p>\"The future of energy prices will be driven by the shale patch. It is quite possible that shale production has peaked for the foreseeable future ??? the cost of capital for production has risen, potentially permanently so. Expected capital expenditures are still declining at a record clip. With budgets under pressure, the share of exploration spending in total investment may hit historic lows, while unconventional projects have less scope for further cost reductions.</p><p>\"This creates a set-up in which energy prices could potentially trade significantly higher. In a post-pandemic world, demand may well continue to recover while US supply growth could remain constrained. Nothing cures low prices like low prices.

Australia's share market closed 1pc higher with gains from heavyweights CSL, BHP and CBA coming before the FOMC meeting. Wall Street had been positive overnight. The Nasdaq closed up 1.2 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.

We need to keep diplomatic channels wide open, to speak frankly and to speak our mind in private with China's government about what we believe, what our standards are, what our values are.</p><p>At the same time, we need to keep the flow of trade moving between our two countries. Both of these things can and must be kept in balance.\"</p><p>As diplomatic relations plumb new lows, the trading relationship has reached new peaks, with more of Australia's exports than ever flowing to China.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/dont-confuse-china-trade-with-security-says-andrew-liveris/news-story/d0c276487168daf3827cb5194600dbf8\">Read more</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.50pm:</emphasis>               Market feels 'very fully valued': Tony James, Blackstone            </p><p>In an exclusive interview, CNBC's Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong interviewed Tony James, executive vice-chairman, Blackstone Group, who said: \"I think the consensus is we should have more stimulus. I think both parties want more stimulus, the White House certainly wants more stimulus, if nothing else for the election. But absent stimulus, I think the Fed's gonna feel more pressure to move. Now, short rates are already near zero, so the concern would be that eventually we get some inflation and that would affect long rates. So yes, in a nutshell, I think in the absence of stimulus, the Fed, keeping that yield curve at the long end down, is helpful.</p><p>\"The market feels very fully valued. In my opinion, it's a little ahead of itself, but I think it's supply and demand, as I say capital continues to run in there. There's also a little bit of a fear of missing out, a little FOMO in there, where everyone's made a lot of money in the market this year and people are piling in. And so I think in the short term, those, you'll continue to have that momentum. </p><p>\"Long term, though I think the market will feel very full over a sort of 10, five to 10-year horizon. I think this could be a lost decade in terms of equity appreciation, both because at some point we'll have interest rates normalizing somewhat, or at best stopping further decline on the one hand, and then there's plenty of headwinds for corporate earnings, there's higher taxes, their operating cost because of COVID are up, their supply chains are going to be less efficient, deglobalization will hurt productivity, state and local employment will be under pressure because of the deficits. </p><p>\"All of that will be economic headwinds for companies, so I think you can have disappointing long-term earnings growth with multiples coming in a little bit. And I could see anemic equity returns over the next five to 10 years.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.33pm:</emphasis>Rio Tinto called out on board diversity            </p><p>When asked if Rio Tinto was part of the Canada Pension Plan portfolio and whether it would be reviewing its holdings in an exclusive interview with CNBC's Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong, Mark Machin, CEO and president of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, replied: \"I'm sure it is. And I have to, I'd have to check. I would imagine we have some nominal holding in one of our passive indices. But it's not a very direct position, I know that for sure. But I can check in a few minutes and tell you exactly how much we own. But it'll be somewhere in one of the major global equity indices that we have in our passive portfolio. And I'm sure that soon we'll be engaging with them.</p><p>\"I say we actively engage, and we will, for example, I mean, I'll take up a related issue, which is gender diversity. So, we strongly believe that diversity on boards is correlated with long term investment returns. And we've done our own internal quantitative analysis on several thousand securities controlling all other factors. And we've shown that's the case. In addition, we've done analysis on 100 external studies and shown that's the case. So, it's quantitatively based. So, three years ago, we started voting against boards in Canada that didn't have women on the board.

Now Sydney and Melbourne prices are correcting and it's the turn of Brisbane and Adelaide to drive national home prices higher. While the jobless rate has risen, interest rates are at generational lows and banks continue to lend,\" James says.</p><p>The surprise packet is the used vehicle market. \"Most car owners expect to see the value of their vehicles eroding over time. But in the COVID-19 era, prices for second-hand vehicles are rising. Aussies are more cautious about using public transport. As a result, people are holding on to their vehicles and more people are looking to purchase an extra vehicle. So demand is up, supply is down and prices are up. Overlaid is the fact that global vehicle production has fallen in the past six months, supporting both new and used vehicle prices. Super-low interest rates are also keeping car financing costs down.</p><p>Data analytics firm, Datium Insights, provides a weekly report on the used vehicle market. In the week to September 14, used vehicle prices rose by 3.4pc after lifting 1.6pc in the previous week.</p><p>In August, used vehicle prices were up 25pc over the year according to the Datium Insights - Moody's Analytics Used Vehicle Price Index.</p><p>The authors of the report noted: \"Demand for wholesale used vehicles was robust last month.

stock markets higher, while momentum from Monday's vaccine optimism and big-name deal making kept Wall Street buoyant.</p><p>Lower-than-feared British unemployment, at 4.1 per cent in the second quarter, and German investor confidence at a level last seen in May 2000 both brightened investors' moods in Europe.</p><p>London's FTSE 100 closed up 1.3 per cent, the Frankfurt DAX 30 gained 0.2 per cent and France's CAC 40 added 0.3 per cent.</p><p>The upward moves in Europe were driven both by \"data and following yesterday's solid US advance,\" Charles Schwab analysts commented.</p><p>But \"the risk of a 'no-deal' Brexit and the potential economic harm that accompanies it increased\" after the British government's move to tear up parts of a hard-fought Brexit deal signed with Brussels early this year, in a re-run of past disagreements over Northern Ireland.</p><p>Legislation putting the move into effect passed its first reading in parliament Monday night.</p><p>Upbeat Chinese figures on retail sales and industrial output had earlier driven Asian stock markets higher.</p><p>The euro fell against both the dollar and sterling, which continued its recovery after diving last week on Brexit woes.</p><p>Meanwhile financial players can expect further support from the US central bank tomorrow.</p><p>\"The Fed will be unable to be optimistic about the recovery until they see how the economy performs when the second wave of the coronavirus hits,\" paving the way for policymakers to keep economic stimulus in place, Moya said.</p><p>Fed chief Jerome Powell \"will likely reiterate the need for Congress to do more\" to support the US economy, he added, with President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner saying any new fiscal package may have to wait until after the November 3 presidential election.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AFP</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.28am:</emphasis>               US sees lukewarm industrial production            </p><p>US industrial production continued to recover from the COVID-19 downturn in August but its pace was slowed by bad weather and a pullback in car manufacturing, the Federal Reserve said.</p><p>Production rose 0.4 per cent last month, well below the 3.5 per cent gain seen in July and 7.3 per cent below its level in February, before the pandemic, the Fed said.</p><p>Hurricane Laura and Tropical Storm Marco brought temporary shutdowns to oil and gas production in the southern United States, causing mining production to fall 2.5 per cent in the month.</p><p>Durable and non-durable manufacturing saw slowing growth compared to July, with motor vehicles and parts declining 3.7 per cent. All told, industrial production was 7.7 per cent lower than August 2019, while capacity rose 0.3 points to 71.4 per cent, slightly below expectations.</p><p>Manufacturing has been clawing back ground lost when business shutdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus began in mid-March, which saw industrial production sink by 12.9 per cent in April before returning to positive territory in the months since.</p><p>\"The rebound continues, but at a slowing pace,\" Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomic said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AFP</emphasis></p><p><emphasis

Trump administration on some $US250 billion worth of Chinese goods, sparking outrage in Washington.</p><p>A panel of experts set up by WTO's Dispute Settlement Body ruled the tariffs \"inconsistent\" with global trade rules, and recommended that the United States \"bring its measures into conformity with its obligations\".</p><p>US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer slammed the decision, saying it proved the WTO, which has long faced searing US criticism, \"is completely inadequate to stop China's harmful technology practices.\" </p><p/><p>\"The Trump Administration will not let China use the WTO to take advantage of American workers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Chinese state media Global Times meanwhile hailed the ruling and said in a tweet it hoped the US would respect it and \"take pragmatic actions to meet China and other WTO members halfway to enable a stable and healthy development of the global economy.\" </p><p>The panel was created in January last year to review US President Donald Trump's decision to hit China with tariffs on a quarter of a trillion dollars' worth of goods.</p><p>The tariffs imposed in 2018 marked the beginning of the trade war between the world's two largest economies.</p><p>Tuesday's announcement marks one of the first in a series of anticipated panel rulings over complaints filed by a long line of countries over Trump's decision to slap them with steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AFP</emphasis></p><p><emphasis

round, putting the estimated value of the company past $US10 billion for the first time.</p><p>Launched in 2005, Klarna now offers an app which provides consumers with an easy platform to shop with

It was the lowest daily close for the sharemarket in just over two months.</p><p>WiseTech dived 7.3 per cent, Appen tumbled 7.1 per cent, Next DC lost 6.8 per cent and Afterpay fell 6.7 per cent on Friday. The losses came after the Nasdaq 100 index fell 5.2 per cent - its biggest fall since June - with Apple down 8 per cent, Tesla down 9 per cent, Nvidia down 9.3 per cent and Microsoft down 6.2 per cent.</p><p>While technology was by far the weakest sector in the local market, the healthcare and consumer staples sectors also underperformed, with CSL down 4.1 per cent and Woolworths losing 3.9\u00a0per cent.</p><p>BHP dived 3.8 per cent and Wesfarmers fell 3.7 per cent, while three of the major banks and Macquarie lost about 3 per cent after the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3.5\u00a0per cent, in its biggest fall since June.</p><p>At the same time, the VIX volatility index jumped seven percentage points to a two-month high of 33.6 per cent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.57pm: </emphasis>Apple leads tech falls            </p><p>Global and local tech stocks slid across the board this week, with Apple alone losing nearly $US180bn ($247bn) in one day, and Australia's \"buy now, pay later\" market darlings facing a new challenge in the form of competition from payments giant PayPal.</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq - home to Australian software maker Atlassian - fell 5 per cent on Thursday, in its biggest one-day fall since June 11. Big Tech led the way, with Facebook falling 3.8 per cent, while Tesla fell 9 per cent, days after it completed a five-for-one stock split. Atlassian fell 5 per cent, and lost another 2 per cent after hours, wiping about $US2bn from its valuation.</p><p>That's nothing compared to Apple, which completed a four-for-one stock split last month. The iPhone maker lost $US179.92bn of its market capitalisation, marking the biggest single-day drop for a US-listed company on record.</p><p>The mass sell-off marked a pullback for technology stocks, which had largely buoyed the market since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March.</p><p>It was also a tough week for Australia's BNPL stocks, which bore the brunt of an announcement from California-based heavyweight PayPal that it, too, was entering the red-hot market.</p><p>PayPal announced a Pay-in-4 functionality in the US market, which will allow customers to split purchases of between $30 and $600 into four repayments over six weeks. Like Afterpay, customers won't be hit with interest charges, but may have to pay a late fee.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/apple-leads-slide-in-global-and-local-tech-stocks/news-story/0e62dcbe19d488fa8a16be2de4241ba5\">Read more</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.25pm: </emphasis>               We need compo, not more stimulus            </p><p>Naturally enough all the headlines after the June quarter national accounts went something like: \"Australia now in its first recession in 29 years!\"</p><p>I was even asked to go on BBC TV that night because they thought it must be really bad news for the world if even the Lucky Country is in recession.</p><p>I had to explain that we're talking about data from two months ago, Australian statisticians being the slowest/most painstaking in the world, so the word \"now\" may or may not apply, and anyway the idea that Australia has not had a recession since 1991 is just a quirk of definition: the only reason there haven't been two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP in 29 years is population growth.

Facebook fell more than 4 per cent and Apple lost nearly 7 per cent, a drop mitigated by its stock split in August. Amazon.com, meanwhile, lost 5.4 per cent.</p><p>Big technology firms have been among the leaders in the broad market rebound. Overall, stocks have soared since March despite the worst economic slump in decades and the novel coronavirus's continued hold even in some countries that had previously showed success in quashing it, confounding investors.</p><p>The decline on Thursday indicates the rally may not continue unabated, investors said.</p><p>Holly MacDonald, investment chief of New York-headquartered multi-family office Bessemer Trust, said the sell-off represented something of a return to more normal conditions and wasn't entirely unexpected given the August gains.

Unemployment claims have continued to edge lower but remain near historic highs, signalling lay-offs continue as the coronavirus hampers the economic recovery.</p><p>The uptick in market volatility could be due to a large number of call options, which confers the right to buy shares, on technology stocks such as Apple and Tesla, according to Saxo Bank. Market makers have been forced to take the other side of such trades, buying the underlying stocks to hedge their positions.</p><p>US stock options trading has been driven by Robinhood traders, said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. If shares in a stock fall enough, market makers will unwind their shares, causing a sharp sell-off.</p><p>\"Over the past few months we've had really quite a strong recovery, and that has started to stall,\" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Renewed tensions between Beijing and Washington also remain a risk for markets. The Trump administration signalled plans to impose new restrictions on Chinese diplomats in the U.S., citing Beijing's use of similar measures on American envoys. The Chinese embassy in Washington responded by accusing the U.S. of violating international conventions, characterising the fresh restrictions as unjustified and urging the country to reconsider.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 0.7 per cent.

The video service stands accused of breaking laws overseeing kids' web habits, placing a massive library of media and accompanying revenue in jeopardy. Neither YouTube nor the regulators have discussed the talks publicly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet despite the secrecy, a small British marketing firm started emailing some marquee YouTube advertisers about the developments. Reports indicated that the FTC would hit YouTube with a record fine and force its operations to change - something, the emails noted, that would \"be of interest to YouTube's sponsors. \"Regardless of what size the fine actually is, it represents a shift in the world for children's digital privacy, read the message. \"Look forward to seeing you soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emails were from SuperAwesome Ltd. Toy makers, animators and other brands pay the company to place online ads or access tools like the startup's \"safe, moderated system for internet comments. In July, SuperAwesome added another offering: a video service, called Rukkaz, that works much like YouTube. Amateur broadcasters upload videos, sponsors back them and kids watch. Only the startup pledged to work with only hand-picked broadcasters, and pitched the service as a way to abide by privacy laws and avoid the demented footage lurking on the open web.</p><p>\"This is something that Google and Facebook, and arguably Apple, should have been doing for the past five years, said Dylan Collins, SuperAwesome's chief executive officer. \"And they haven't.</p><p>Waves of new media darlings have tried to unseat YouTube, with no success. But Collins is one of several entrepreneurs trying to strike while YouTube is in turmoil. The video behemoth, owned by Alphabet Inc.'s Google, has earned a reputation as a Wild West of media, a place where young viewers have too readily stumbled on footage of crass humor or bloody violence.</p><p>Lawmakers have asked about this, part of the scrutiny of the privacy practices and dominance of big tech. The FTC is probing whether Google violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which prohibits tracking the personal information of minors under thirteen. YouTube's frequent tweaks to its all-powerful algorithms and ads policies have left video creators disgruntled.</p><p>A handful of upstarts are hoping this momentum will help their cause. They've roped in venture financing, licensing deals and customers with the promise of creating kid-safe internet real estate.</p><p>The FTC is inadvertently playing a role, too. Uncertainty over the case is producing panic in parts of the YouTube community, prompting some stars to hunt for alternatives. News reports surfaced that the FTC may force YouTube to move all children's videos to its Kids app or cut them off from ads. YouTube has offered no public statement on the issue and rumors have filled the vacuum.</p><p>\"No one really has a sense of what is going to happen, said Michael, who runs KidCity and two other YouTube family channels. He is one of more than 150 YouTubers jumping to Rukkaz. He isn't moving off YouTube, but will cross-post select YouTube clips with the startup, which will share ad revenue. He asked that his last name not be revealed to protect the privacy of his two children.</p><p>Kid's media online is booming as millions of children swap Saturday morning cartoons for streaming and smartphones. Most streaming services, like Netflix, run curated, slickly produced shows for kids, while YouTube relies on a mountain of unscripted, user-generated content. Multiple people who make these videos said that, in recent months, support representatives from YouTube have halted contact without explanation. A chief concern for many creators is that their videos will be restricted to YouTube Kids, a much less popular service, where Google runs fewer ads.</p><p>\"That would put everyone out of business. I mean, almost overnight, said Michael.</p><p>YouTube is unlikely to do that, or to cut off all its kids and family footage from ads. Instead, to comply with the FTC, YouTube is planning to end \"targeted ads on videos kids are likely to watch, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday. That solution would make it harder for the creators behind those clips to earn more from ads, although it's a less draconian move than some other rumored options.</p><p>A problem with this approach, though, is defining kids' videos. COPPA applies to any web service \"directed to children. While most clips on YouTube Kids, such as nursery rhyme cartoons, clearly are, other huge swaths of YouTube, like footage of video game streaming, arguably aren't. Yet it's an open secret that younger viewers love watching people play video games. Roughly a quarter of the YouTube ads one major toy company buys run on Minecraft videos, according to a media buyer with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private data.</p><p>\"The difficulty here is determining what is kid's directed,' said Ashkan Soltani, a privacy researcher who previously served as the Chief Technologist for the FTC. \"It's not a bright-line rule.</p><p>Once the line is drawn, YouTube creators do not want to fall on the wrong side. Many, like KidCity's Michael, now describe their productions as \"family-based play or \"co-play - videos that feature adults and, the hope is, that adults watch.</p><p>YouTube is not the only major player in an uncomfortable spot; other tech platforms are under similar pressure. The FTC fined Bytedance Inc., the owner of popular app TikTok, for violating federal guidelines on minors. Critics have complained that Facebook Inc. illegally tracks children's online behavior. Many in children's media don't expect a viable solution to come from the household names.</p><p>\"It doesn't make sense that big internet companies can take something they designed for grown-ups and make that for kids, said Kevin Donahue, an early YouTube executive who now runs Epic, an e-book startup. \"You have to create something new. (Donahue said has no interest in rivaling his old company, though. \"We're not at all doing that, he said.)</p><p>For most newcomers, that something looks like Netflix: A subscription service with a limited selection. The idea is that parents would pay for some parts of YouTube popular with kids: the toy unboxers and niche animators, without the pratfalls of an unlimited content library. Three years ago, Epic added video to its $7.99 a month e-books app. It offers a few thousand clips, all reviewed by staff members. Kidoodle.TV, a Canadian company, offers children's videos on set-top box services like Roku. Another, JuniorTube, had a slate of curated amateur videos available on a subscription-based app. Earlier this week, Roku added a new curated kids and family section.</p><p>Highbrow, a London-based startup, sells a $6.49 monthly service with a tagline \"trusted by schools and parents worldwide. Priyanka Raswant, a corporate lawyer, formed the company as she was preparing to have her first child. She found most videos available on YouTube Kids \"nonsensical and the app unhelpful for parents.</p><p>\"If you see something outrageous, you have to report it, Raswant said. \"They've put the onus on the parents. Most parents don't even have time to brush their teeth.</p><p>Highbrow has partnered with telecoms in Latin America and India for distribution, but doesn't share sales data. The service carries videos from Pinkfong, the studio behind mega-hit \"Baby Shark, as well as smaller shows like \"Travel With Kids from PBS.</p><p>SuperAwesome is one of the few borrowing YouTube's model of free, ad-supported programming. The startup is set to book $60 million in revenue this year. (YouTube doesn't share sales, but estimates place the yearly sales from its kids' content north of $700 million.) Collins said his company is profitable. Of course, the uncertainty surrounding kids' online video could also threaten those profits. His ad business is competing against those at the twin giants of Google and Facebook. The benefits of SuperAwesome's ad services might not be as apparent if YouTube passes through the FTC probe unscathed and grows its Kids' app.</p><p>That could mean that more is riding on Collins' video service. For Rukkaz, Collins is targeting YouTube's blind spots. Most of YouTube Kids caters to preschoolers, so Collins is recruiting creators aiming for an older audience. He's also approaching creators with between 500 thousand and a million subscribers on YouTube - enough to earn livings from the site, but not to be inculcated from its swings. \"This entire community is really being orphaned by YouTube, Collins said.</p><p>Michael, who runs the KidCity channel, is optimistic about Rukkaz. He's planning to use SuperAwesome's feature for hosting video comments, which he finds useful for getting audience feedback. YouTube shut off comments on videos with children earlier this year, but allowed a select group of channels to keep them with the condition they \"actively moderate the posts. Filtering those comments, though, requires using a manual system. \"You have to go in there and spell the dirty words, he said.</p><p>His attempts to find footing beyond YouTube haven't succeed in the past. On KidCity, the Texan father and his two children perform long skits dressed up as familiar cartoon characters - Marvel Comic's Wolverine or Disney's Queen Elsa. They tried to post one of these clips on Amazon's self-publishing service, Prime Video Direct, but the company rejected the videos citing intellectual property concerns. A KidCity clip of his son donning a Spiderman costume and testing a Spiderman toy has over 85 million views on YouTube. YouTube's laissez-faire approach to media has brought scathing critics, but it has also enabled countless careers online.</p><p>\"That's the creator platform for kids, said Michael. \"The only one, unfortunately.</p><p>At least one would-be YouTube rival has already bit the dust. JuniorTube, a company based in Indiana, made a paid app and recruited a few established YouTubers. Like the others, it managed the costs of hosting video and other back-end services, splitting sales with video producers. In May, these producers received an email that JuniorTube had shut down \"due to very poor business performance and audience interest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2019234593</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXN-V6M1-JCB7-11G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's had a long and controversial life, starting out as an upstart web browser that grew to global dominance, before winding up a punchline[1]. Its quarter-century anniversary comes at an interesting time, since it was once at the heart of Big Tech's first antitrust drama.On July 29th earlier this year, the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google were hauled in front of the House Judiciary Committee. Officials are now scrutinizing these companies looking for abuses of power, with sentiment turned against them on both sides of the aisle. The notable omission is, of course, Microsoft, which went through this process at the turn of the century and still has the scars to prove it. </p><p>In the early '90s, Netscape ruled the world with Navigator, an internet browser that was easy and accessible, empowering folks to get online. For $49 -- unless you had a free version provided by your ISP -- the nascent internet was at your fingertips. Microsoft had slept on the web and belatedly came to the conclusion that it was a threat to Windows' global dominance. So, far later than it should, the company decided that it needed to take ownership of what we did online.Microsoft drew, uh, inspiration from Netscape, licensing code from the browser Netscape was based on (Mosaic) and set to work. At the start, Internet Explorer wasn't as good as Navigator. It didn't play well with Java and was riddled with bugs. But it also had the virtue of being free, as Microsoft began giving it away with Windows updates and eventually baking it into the OS itself. This set an expectation that nobody need ever pay for a web browser ever again. Robert Sorbo via Getty Images In 1995, Netscape Navigator reportedly held 70 and 80 percent of the US web browser market. However, by 1998, Internet Explorer had supplanted Netscape on the back of this free giveaway. But it wasn't just the public who had noticed: So had Bill Clinton's Department of Justice, who had been lobbied by Netscape about what was going on.That same year, the Department of Justice launched an antitrust action, investigating whether Microsoft had violated antitrust laws. They contended that bundling Internet Explorer with the OS, and giving it away for free, violated the first two sections of the Sherman Act. It didn't go well for Microsoft. CEO Bill Gates was roasted in depositions by (future star lawyer) David Boies. The judge agreed, and declared in his judgment that Microsoft wasn't just behaving anti-competitively, it also needed to be broken up.In his decision[2], Judge Thomas P. Jackson said that Microsoft was attempting to hold onto a monopoly through 'anticompetitive means.' He added that the company should be split into two: One building the Windows operating system and another responsible for other software. But rather than motion for a hearing to further examine if a break-up was appropriate, he just demanded it.This immediately gave Microsoft a point of law on which to base an appeal, and Jackson's decision would be examined in great detail by The Ringer[3]. Department of Justice economist Daniel Rubinfeld said that his colleagues 'assumed that there would be a follow-on set of hearings,' to hash out the merits of breaking up Microsoft. Then acting attorney-general Doug Melamed added that Jackson's ruling implied that he was 'tired of the case' in a way that was 'irresponsible.'The EU opened its own investigation later in 2009, eventually insisting that when people launched Internet Explorer, they should have the option to download a rival product. They were presented with a list that included Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari as well as a number of other, less well-known platforms. But this 'Browser Ballot' started in 2010 and expired in 2014, when Internet Explorer was in decline.Microsoft would eventually settle with the Department of Justice, establishing a three-person independent committee would have the power to scrutinize Microsoft's business. The company also had to develop an internal antitrust compliance policy to ensure this didn't happen again. But it was a case of too little, too late for Netscape, which was bought by Aol (now owned by Verizon Media, Engadget's parent company) just as its market share began falling. By 2004, Internet Explorer had around 90 percent of the market, Navigator had faded to single digits[4]. Microsoft had won.And then, just as soon as it had, it began to lose. Firefox had been slowly eating small chunks of Microsoft's market share, and then in 2008, Google's Chrome turned up. The two browsers between them were breaths of fresh air compared to Internet Explorer, with its numerous flaws. Its lack of standards compliance, persistent faults and the ease at which it would crash meant power users hated it.There are a number of market share sources, each with slightly different statistics, but the trend is unmistakable. From owning the market in 2004, Microsoft's dominance was eroded pretty much constantly. By 2013, Internet Explorer had less than 30 percent of the market, with the spoils being shared by Chrome, Firefox and Apple's Safari, as iOS grew into the juggernaut it is today. Internet Explorer wound up a joke that even Microsoft had to laugh at.Microsoft would, eventually, replace Internet Explorer with Edge, a new browser that has since been redeveloped to use Google's Chromium engine. It fixes many of the problems that people ever had with its predecessor.The brush with the government was a chastening experience for Microsoft and one that may have dented its ambitions. Senator Richard Blumenthal and academic Tim Wu wrote in The New York Times[5] that the case forced Microsoft to be more cautious. 'Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business,' they wrote, 'Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web.'They argued that Microsoft, even with a more friendly Department of Justice under G.W. Bush, was far less aggressive. And in doing so, allowed a space into which Google, Facebook, Amazon and others could grow on their own terms. And yes, they added, while it was ironic that those companies were now in the line of fire, it was evidence of a healthy market.In fact, Microsoft has hardly suffered from its apparent indiscretion, becoming one of the wealthiest companies in the world. It's more profitable now than it was at the height of its notoriety, despite the fact that many of its rivals are now soaking up the attention.The makers of real-time messenger Slack say that its business is being ripped off by Microsoft Teams, which is now bundled as part of Office 365.'They created a weak, copycat product,' said Slack general counsel David Schellhase 'and tied it to their dominant Office product.' Schellhase added that it's the same play Microsoft adopted in their (admittedly successful) attempt to topple Netscape Navigator. Slack has now filed a complaint with the European Commission[6], asking for regulators to investigate the behavior.But that is for the future. We're at the very start of Big Tech's antitrust reckoning[7], but it'll be interesting to see how all of this shakes out. Maybe, we'll see a whole new wave of innovation and a whole new bunch of companies emerging from the conflicts. What will the next tech giant create in the wake of what happens in the next few years? We don't know, but perhaps it'll be just as interesting as what came after Internet Explorer.

From the tulip bubble of the 1630s, to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, to the big-tech mania we're seeing today, overvaluations happen \u2014 but not all bubbles pose the same risks or offer the same rewards. Every few years, it seems we're warned ofanother looming 'bubble'[1]about to burst. Most recently, pundits like Warren Buffett and George Soros have compared the rise of cryptocurrency to thedot-com bubble[2], wondering aloud if we're on the precipice of a big bust. </p><p>The similarities are fairly obvious. Cryptocurrency startups, much like the dot-coms, are experiencing an influx of capital that's boosting the valuations of solid, innovative companies along with their relatively worthless counterparts \u2014Dogecoin[3]comes to mind as a cautionary tale. But while the dot-com boom produced plenty of duds, let's not forget that it also gave birth to Amazon, Google, and eBay. Similarly, there are resilient, well-managed cryptocurrency companies that will be able to withstand drastic market fluctuations. Sure, the current state of cryptocurrency bears some resemblance to the '90s tech boom, but there are important differences to consider. Understanding the following factors can help you to mitigate long-term damage as the market naturally begins to self-correct. 1. Say hello to regulation:Cryptocurrencies, unlike the early dot-coms, are shaking up the U.S. monetary system and offering an alternative to worldwide fiat currency. Early internet technology was groundbreaking, but decentralized currency is truly revolutionary. Most governments don't quite understand what's going on, much less how to deal with it. Recent fluctuations in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were the direct result of new regulations announced by theSouth Korean government[4], and other regulatory agencies across the world are guaranteed to make similar moves. They will eventually make examples of nefarious players, helping to weed out more 'shadowy' companies from the industry. Be ready to work with government agencies and adapt tonew regulations[5]when they inevitably arrive. Private companies that behave like public companies are more likely to come out on top. In that same vein, be sure you're not taking a ton of money from unaccredited investors \u2014 or investing it in secretive ways. The industry may not yet be fully regulated, but you need to start running your company as if it were. 2. Just say noto casual investing:Yes, some venture capitalists in the dot-com era would throw money at any startup that showed signs of life, but the risks seem greater for those entering the crypto space with insufficient knowledge.More than 1,000 cryptocurrencies[6]are active right now, and quite a few are hoping to ride the wave without doing their homework first. Perceived bubbles are funny: They can propel even the worst companies to the top of the stock charts. You need to understand how to capitalize on the bubble \u2014 raising as much capital as you can (without destroying the structure of your company) and then managing that cash (knowing it won't always be there). Be able to effectively communicate your long-term value to shareholders. Theblockchain[7]is a brilliant invention, with applications we're just beginning to discover, ranging from the financial space to healthcare, cybersecurity, retail, and beyond. It will transform the world as we know it, making a handful of companies and their investors extremely wealthy in the process. To find investors who will stay with you for the long haul, showcase realistic,revenue-generatingapplications of this technology and prove it can outlive the hype. 3. Abandon geographical boundaries:While the dot-com bust had some ripple effects on the world economy, the rise and fall of Silicon Valley was far more localized. Cryptocurrency is traded across the world, and countries are taking vastly different approaches in their adoption and regulation of it. South Korea only recently started exploring regulation, for instance, while Sweden has been offering derivatives in Bitcoin since 2015. The international scope of this marketplace presents both unique challenges and an array of opportunities. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, argues thatblockchain offers particular value[8]in parts of the world where people can't yet trust their institutions \u2014 places such as Africa, India, and Eastern Europe. Blockchain, he argues, resolves the issue of market manipulation from the top-down. All that's to say: You must invest in a capable management team that can see the big picture. Nobody will predict every little twist and turn in the market, but the better your understanding of how your company could succeed on an international scale, the higher your chances of success. When looking for dynamic and adaptable management teams, focus on candidates with a track record of success \u2014 those who can navigate an ever-changing technology landscape while incorporating traditional financial market tactics. At Neptune Dash we did just that, incorporating a well-versed technology team with adept financial leaders with proven success on public markets. Finding footing on shaky ground The '90s tech boom was followed by a solid bust. In November 2000, an index of 280 internet stocks was down by$1.7 trillion[9]from its 52-week high. Contrast that with recent fluctuations in digital coins, and the difference is obvious. Its value may rise and fall, but anyone who bought Bitcoin a year ago has earned more than asixfold[10]return on investment, for example. The highs may be higher and the lows may be lower than in other industries, but the underlying technology is here to stay. Despite the common misconception, not all bubbles are created equal.

View original post here[2]. It was a tale of two markets on Thursday, with industrial and European stocks opening much higher on Thursday, pushing world stocks to new four-month highs after Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to negotiate on trade, putting fears of a transatlantic trade war on hold for the time being. At the same time, Nasdaq futures and tech stocks around the globe were hit after Facebook shocked investors yesterday, by not only missing on revenue (for the first time in 3 years), and number of users, but with its unexpectedly low guidance. S...00 futures also pointed lower, however the drop has been contained.  In what the EU chief called a 'major concession,' President Trump agreed on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers. </p><p>As a result, there were gains across the board for European stocks on Thursday morning, led by the continent's auto sector, which was up 2% at one point German's export-reliant and auto-heavy index rose 1.4%.  It wasn't just Europe: the global trade truce sent the MSCI world equity index to its highest level since March 16. 'The lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development. We've not seen a lot of actual measures implemented but it should lift the confidence of manufacturers,' said RBC European economist Cathal Kennedy. 'The feedthrough should come through in the manufacturing sector and confidence indicators in the coming months.' Meanwhile, some more dark clouds gathered over China: Asian stocks were held back by weakness in China, where the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.7% and blue-chip shares lost 1.1%, despite China announcing even more stimulus overnight.  Why? Because with Europe now siding with the US, and with transatlantic mood was improving, the collapse of the Qualcomm-NXP deal means that Trump will focus his attention on trade war with China even more. And then there was Facebook, which plunged as much as 24% after reporting Q2 earnings, but it was the conference call that shocked investors, and sent the stock into freefall. In fact, this was the single most costly conference call in history. At one point, the total market value lost by Facebook was $151 billion - representing the biggest one day stock wipeout in history [3]- and more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin.  Nasdaq 100 futures were pressured by Facebook's collapse; eslewhere NXP Semiconductors plunged -10.2% after it confirmed Qualcomm's (+5.5% pre-market) exit from the deal. Qualcomm will pay a USD 2bln termination fee. Adding insult to injury, Facebook is the most widely held stock among the hedge-fund community by a wide margin [4]according to Goldman, which means today there may be some serious margin calls.  If anything, Facebook's collapse showed just how complacent the momentum-chasing market has become, and how susceptible it is to sudden, sharp repricings. For now, however, FANG has been defangded to just AG, and A has yet to report. It wasn't just tech on the receiving end: automakers General Motors, Ford Motor and FiatChrysler Automobiles have cut profit forecasts, while Daimler blamed U.S.-China tariffs for a 30% drop in second-quarter profit. GM suffered its biggest daily drop in 3 years. Focus will now turn back to central bank policy: as Reuters notes, the softer U.S.-EU tone should help the European Central Bank stick with its plan to gradually withdraw stimulus when it meets later on Thursday. Few expect Draghi to make any notable announcement today, however, in what is expected to be a status quo call. The Euro weakened as Mario Draghi is expected to repeat a guidance that bond purchases will end in December and interest rates could start rising after the summer of 2019. The yen fell 0.3% against the dollar, reversing 6 consecutive days of gains, but traders will carefully watch the BOJ's policy announcement on July 30-31 after this week's brief jump in yields and the Japanese currency on reports authorities were debating paring back some stimulus. BoJ is reportedly reviewing the allocation of ETF purchases and is considering purchasing more ETFs linked to TOPIX and less associated with Nikkei indices, but is likely to maintain the total annual ETF buying at JPY 6tln. In separate reports, Twitter sources noted the BoJ may consider dropping JGB buying operation dates release and may allow slight JGB yield curve steepening, while there BoJ were also said to see higher super long yields having a favourable effect. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% after slump on Wednesday with dollar marginally stronger against most G-10 peers. Treasuries rose, in contrast to a drop in bonds across most of Europe. Japan's benchmark 10-year bond yield climbed 3.5bps to 0.1%, a level last seen in July 2017. Yield rose as much as 6bps on Monday, the most intraday since September 2016, following media reports of possible changes to the central bank's ultra-loose monetary policy at its meeting next week. There is a divergence in the performance of WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.8%) with the latter supported by reports that Saudi Arabia have temporarily halted shipments via the Red Sea shipping lane after 2 vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels. This was then followed by reports that Kuwait are debating whether to halt oil exports via the passage given recent events. In metals markets, spot gold (-0.2%) is slightly softer in European trade amid the modestly firmer USD after the PBoC bucked their recent trend by strengthening the CNY fix rate. Elsewhere, metals prices in London have broadly been supported by the aforementioned breakthrough in trade talks between the EU and US. Steel prices were seen higher during Asia-Pac trade with gains capped by fears over the Chinese crackdown on domestic pollution. Data include wholesale inventories and durable-goods orders.

The U.S. and European Union will 'hold off on other tariffs'' while negotiations proceed, as well as re-examine U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory duties imposed by the EU 'in due course,' Juncker said  British officials are considering allowing the EU to impose its market regulations on Northern Ireland, while the rest of the U.K. breaks away after Brexit, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named outlining proposals that aren't public  Cities outside London are more exposed to the effects of a bad deal for financial services after Brexit than the U.K. capital, according to a report published on Thursday  Some Chinese banks have received notice from regulators that a specific capital requirement will be eased in order to support lending, as the authorities try to mitigate increasing risks to the economy from the trade war  European carmakers surged after President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean- Claude Juncker agreed to declare a ceasefire in their trade spat while they negotiate lower barriers to transatlantic commerce  The major Asia-Pac equity markets traded subdued as a plethora of corporate updates dominated news flow and somewhat drowned out the US-EU trade talks where concessions were made to avoid a trade war, while Nasdaq 100 futures were also pressured overnight as Facebook's market cap dropped by around USD 140bln after revenue and active user numbers missed expectations. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) were subdued with M...ews the catalyst for the biggest movers in Australia as Fairfax surged from a takeover deal by Nine Entertainment which subsequently weighed on the latter, while the Japanese benchmark was dampened by a firmer currency and reports the BoJ could adjust its ETF purchases more towards those associated with the TOPIX and less at those associated with Nikkei indices. Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) were also lower alongside the broad lacklustre tone in the regional majors and following another consecutive liquidity drain by the PBoC. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower as yields continued to gain in which the 10yr yield rose to its highest level in a year of 0.1% amidst the speculation of a possible BoJ policy tweak next week, while today's 2yr JGB auction was also weaker than previous on nearly all metrics. BoJ is reportedly to review the allocation of ETF purchases and is considering purchasing more ETFs linked to TOPIX and less associated with Nikkei indices, but is likely to maintain the total annual ETF buying at JPY 6tln. In separate reports, Twitter sources noted the BoJ may consider dropping JGB buying operation dates release and may allow slight JGB yield curve steepening, while there BoJ were also said to see higher super long yields having a favourable effect. Top Asian News China Is Said to Ease Bank Capital Rule to Free Up Lending  China's Yuan, Stocks Lag Global Peers as Trade Concerns Persist  China Approves Essilor, Luxottica Merger Deal With Conditions  Old-School Media Unite in Australia to Confront Netflix Era  European bourses trade mostly higher across the board as markets digest the fallout of yesterday's EU-US trade talks and react to a slew of large cap earnings. Sentiment for the auto sector in particular has been boosted by news that the EU and US agreed to not raise tariffs on autos and parts during negotiations. This has boosted the likes of Volkswagen (+3.1 %), BMW (+3.0%) and Daimler (+2.3%) with the latter seeing gains capped by its pre-market earnings report; DAX outperforms its peers with gains of 1.4% (vs. Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%). Elsewhere, on a sector basis, energy names lag their peers amid losses in Shell (-2.1%) with the Co.'s USD 25bln buyback and 30% increase in profits not enough to satisfy investors with some flagging concerns surrounding cashflow; FTSE 100 (Unch) lags its peers given Shell's weighting in the index, with the FTSE also hampered by recent gains in the GBP and an overall lack of upside catalysts. Other notable movers post-earnings include: Airbus (+5.0%), British American Tobacco (+4.5%), Smith ...phew (+3.8%), KPN (+3.4%), Roche (+2.0%), Nestle (+1.7%), Nokia (-8.1%), Valeo (-6.7%), AB Inbev (-5.1%), Schneider Electric (-1.4%), Anglo American (-1.2%) and Diageo (-1.1%). Top European News Repsol Earnings Miss, Rising Costs Offset Higher Oil Output  Accor Drops Plan to Buy Minority Stake in Air France-KLM  Anglo Bucks Mining Trend by Pouring Profit Into Mega Project  Barclays, UBS Win Dismissal From Silver, Gold Price-Fixing Suits  Trump-Juncker LNG Pledge Is Just Hot Air for Europe's Gas Market  In FX, there was another DXY downturn and breach of near term support for the index in wake of a truce on tariffs struck between Trump and Juncker yesterday, pending more talks to resolve the trade barriers and import restrictions at issue. The DXY is trying to stabilise and pare some losses after hitting a new low for the week just above 94.000 vs 94.206 at worst on Monday. Chart-wise, 93.950 is now within striking distance if the index fails to sustain recovery momentum and loses more ground vs G10 peers. JPY - The biggest beneficiary of the latest Usd downturn, but also in its own right as hawkish BoJ reports continue to circulate ahead of next week's policy meeting. Consequently, the headline pair is back under 111.00 and looking at bearish/downside tech levels around 110.65 (50% Fib) before 110.51 (55 DMA). AUD - Back to the bottom of the pile and heavy again above 0.7400 vs its US counterpart as initial euphoria over the aforementioned US-EU 'agreement' wanes amidst ongoing US-China strains that have more bearing down under. YUAN - Intervention of sorts, with a marked drop in the PBoC's official Usd/Cny fix overnight (to 6.7662 vs 6.8040 on Wednesday) and widespread reports of 1 year forward selling down to flat points from 100+ against spot at 6.7800 and 6.7900 for the Cnh. In commodities, once again markets are seeing a divergence in the performance of WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (+0.8%) with the latter supported by reports that Saudi Arabia have temporarily halted shipments via the Red Sea shipping lane after 2 vessels were attacked by Houthi rebels. This was then followed by reports that Kuwait are debating whether to halt oil exports via the passage given recent events. In metals markets, spot gold (-0.2%) is slightly softer in European trade amid the modestly firmer USD after the PBoC bucked their recent trend by strengthening the CNY fix rate. Elsewhere, metals prices in London have broadly been supported by the aforementioned breakthrough in trade talks between the EU and US. Steel prices were seen higher during Asia-Pac trade with gains capped by fears over the Chinese crackdown on domestic pollution. Looking at the day ahead now, the main focus for markets will be the aforementioned ECB monetary policy meeting at 7:45am ET followed by Draghi's press conference after. Data-wise, we'll get the June advance goods trade balance, preliminary June wholesale inventories, June retail inventories, preliminary June durable goods and capital goods orders and the July Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity reading are all slated for release. Away from the data, the WTO will hold a General Council meeting to cover issues related to the US-China trade conflict, while notable earnings releases for the day include Intel and Amazon.

Activity, est. 25, prior 28  DB's Craig Nicol concludes the overnight wrap Needless to say, the meeting last night between President Trump and European Commission President Juncker has been the big news over the last 10 hours or so. Indeed after much second guessing throughout yesterday leading into the meeting, news broke just before 9pm BST that the two sides had reached a ceasefire in the trade war. Specifically, Trump and Juncker agreed to expand European imports of US LNG and soybeans, while both sides also agreed on lowering industrial tariffs. Trump also said that the US and EU were to work towards 'zero' tariffs and called it a 'new phase' of trade relations, while adding that the two sides would try to 'resolve' steel and aluminium tariffs imposed earlier this year by the US. It's worth noting that trade in vehicles and car parts was left out of the statement, which as we know was the main point of contention going into the meeting especially after a Washington Post article hit the wires in the afternoon stating that several of President Trump's senior economic advisors were of the view that the President planned to impose a 25% tariff on nearly $200bn in 'foreign-made automobiles' this year. However, the specific details of the statement last night between Trump and Juncker are less important right now and it's more likely that this marks the start of what could well be a long negotiation period. Signs of a compromise are clearly more significant for now in markets with the threat of an all-out trade war receding. That said DB's Alan Ruskin made the point last night that caution is still warranted, most obviously on what this might mean for US-China trade relations where problems are more deep-seated. So plenty still to ponder then. In terms of what markets did, well US equity markets spent most of yesterday gently climbing but the initial headlines about the EU offering concessions following the meeting saw stocks sharply rise into the close, and that continued as more positive headlines emerged. The S...00, Dow and Nasdaq finished +0.91%, +0.68% and +1.17% respectively. Tech led gains while telecoms was the only sector to finish in the red for the S...With much of the day spent focused on autos, the sub-sector closed down -1.46% however did pare losses of as big as -5.35% at one stage. More on it shortly. Meanwhile credit indices in the US were tighter with CDX IG finishing 1.7bps tighter while Treasury yields climbed into the close with 10y yields finishing +2.6bps higher at 2.975% and the 2s10s curve flattening 1.0bps to around 30bps. The EUR/USD rose +0.64% from the lows to finish +0.36% on the day. Metals and Oil were also stronger across the board. This morning in Asia the enthusiasm following the Trump-Juncker meeting has faded quickly with the focus quickly turning back to corporate earnings after Facebook shares plunged as much as 24% after missing consensus revenue forecasts for the first time since 2015. Depending on what happens today, we could be looking at one of the largest valuation declines for a big tech company ever. Nasdaq futures are down -0.88% as we type on the news while the Nikkei (-0.08%), Hang Seng (-0.74%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.63%) have all turned lower.Away from all that JGB yields are higher this morning (2y +0.9bps and 10y+2.3bps) along with the Yen (+0.22%) following more reports that the BoJ might be considering a review of its ETF allocation. The 10y JGB is close to 0.09% now so it'll be interesting to see if the BoJ steps in to offer to buy bonds again like it did on Monday. Back to yesterday, where prior to the Trump-Juncker meeting much of the day was spent digesting the moves in the auto sector, firstly following corporate results from General Motors and FiatChrysler, and then following the Washington Post tariff story. General Motors and FiatChrysler closed -4.64% and -15.50% respectively (the latter falling by the most since January 2017) following downgraded earnings guidance for the full year. The bad news kept coming after the US close too when Ford announced weaker than expected results and a projected $11bn in charges for a five-year restructuring plan. Much was made of the GM results in particular though after it became the latest company to cite headwinds from the trade war. Indeed higher raw material prices, including steel and aluminium as a result of the tariffs, are expected to be a $1bn headwind in 2018 which is almost double what the company had previously expected. This follows Harley Davidson and Whirlpool as other high profile US companies this week highlighting risks to profits from tariffs, forcing the companies to raise prices. While last night's developments between Trump and Juncker were positive, it's still very early days so it's unlikely that this is the last we hear of corporates warning about headwinds from tariffs. Indeed Daimler are due to report any second now so it's worth keeping an eye on that. Staying with autos, as a result of that fall for FiatChrysler, in Europe the Stoxx Auto and Parts sector collapsed -2.90% for the second worst day for the sector this year. Other notable auto names which retreated included Volkswagen (-2.72%), Renault (-2.14%) and BMW (-2.05%). The broader Stoxx 600 index finished -0.26% with these moves obviously coming before the evening developments post the Trump and Juncker meeting. Core bond markets in Europe were also largely 0.5bps to 1.0bp lower. So as the market continues to digest the developments from the Trump-Juncker meeting last night, there's also an ECB meeting to keep an eye on at lunchtime today. As a reminder, our European economists expect Mario Draghi to aim for a 'Goldilocks' tone - that is neither too hawkish nor too dovish. In their view the impression from recent press stories is that the ECB thinks the market has priced its new policy stance too dovishly. Using the team's modified Taylor Rule, they show that the market is fully pricing an escalation of trade war - a markedly worse economic scenario than the ECB's baseline or the consensus. Without a clear materialization of the risk scenarios, they believe the market should price a first hike by end 2019 with a reasonable probability. DB's baseline call is a 20bp deposit rate hike in September 2019 (25bp refi hike). In terms of the limited data that was out yesterday, in the US, June new home sales fell -5.3% mom to the lowest in eight months (631k vs. 668k expected). Meanwhile the median selling price fell just over 4% yoy for the second month. In Europe the Euro area's June M3 money supply reading rose to a five month high of 4.4% yoy (vs. 4.0% expected). Adjusting for sales and securitizations, growth in household loans was steady at 2.9% yoy but loans to non-financial corporates rose to a new high of 4.1% yoy. In Germany, the July IFO survey nudged +0.1pts higher mom to 105.2 (vs. 104.9 expected), while the expectations index eased 0.9pt mom to the lowest level since March 2016 (98.2 vs. 98.3 expected). Here in the UK, the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey reported that a net 20% of retailers are seeing positive annual growth in sales - with a net 20% expecting growth to continue next month. Finally, as for the latest on Brexit, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney has called on the EU to be more flexible in its Brexit negotiations with the UK. He believes the latest proposal by PM May could be accommodated by both sides, but there are 'challenges' to some parts of her proposal - including a customs system where British officials collect EU tariffs at the UK border on goods destined for other countries in the bloc. Elsewhere, the BoE's Sam Woods noted the central bank has contingency planning for Brexit, similar to its preparations for the Scottish independence referendum and Brexit vote earlier. He added that BoE's stress tests last year showed banks are strong enough to weather a disorderly Brexit based on its own capital and liquidity. Looking at the day ahead now, the main focus for markets will be the aforementioned ECB monetary policy meeting at 12.45pm BST followed by Draghi's press conference after. Data-wise, we'll get the August consumer confidence print for Germany and July consumer confidence data for France. In the US, the June advance goods trade balance, preliminary June wholesale inventories, June retail inventories, preliminary June durable goods and capital goods orders and the July Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity reading are all slated for release. Away from the data, the WTO will hold a General Council meeting to cover issues related to the US-China trade conflict, while notable earnings releases for the day include Intel and Amazon.

The unprecedented hearing will also feature chief executives Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.    The CEOs of four of the most powerful companies in the world will testify remotely at the hearing, which comes less than 100 days before the US election.    Zuckerberg is to say that the internet giant would not have succeeded without US laws fostering competition, but that the rules of the internet now need updating.    \u201cFacebook is a proudly American company,\u201d Zuckerberg said in prepared remarks ahead of what will be a closely watched House Judiciary Committee hearing.    \u201cOur story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation.\u201d    Bezos will paint the online giant as a vibrant American \u201csuccess\u201d story, while accepting a need for scrutiny.    \u201cI believe Amazon should be scrutinized,\u201d Bezos said in prepared remarks posted online ahead of the hearing.    But he struck a defiant note, too, saying that \u201cwhen you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you\u2019re doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.\u201d    It will be the first time Bezos has testified before Congress.    But Zuckerberg also acknowledged \u201cconcerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have.\u201d    \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    The showdown in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.    \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy, and election integrity on their own,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared remarks read.    Big vs bad    Questions at the hearing are expected to veer into issues ranging beyond whether the technology titans are abusing their power in marketplaces.    Current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing they cause harm to consumers or abuse their market power.    \u201cWe believe in values\u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression\u2014that the American economy was built on,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    \u201cMany other tech companies share these values, but there\u2019s no guarantee our values will win out.\u201d    He is to cite the example of China building and exporting a version of the internet focused on \u201cvery different ideas\u201d from the US model.    \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to maintain the core values of openness and fairness that have made America\u2019s digital economy a force for empowerment and opportunity here and around the world,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    Tech company chiefs are expected to stress how they benefit consumers, particularly during the pandemic, and face competition\u2014particularly from China.    Bezos will spotlight increasing competition among online retail platforms.    \u201cOur success may help explain the wide proliferation of marketplaces of all types and sizes around the world,\u201d Bezos said.    \u201cThis includes US companies like Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Target, as well as retailers based overseas but selling globally, such as Alibaba and Rakuten.\u201d    The antitrust debate is being muddled by a rising \u201ctechlash\u201d over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality to political bias.    \u201cFacebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    \u201cAs I understand our laws, companies aren\u2019t bad just because they are big. Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist.    Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle conservative views\u2014a claim made by President Donald Trump.    Facebook has been accused of failing to curb hateful content promoting violence, including from Trump.    Click on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews .

The fiscal cliff bill is full of tax credit extensions and other necessary sections that extend measures with expiration dates. </p><p><br/> While a number of extraneous measures[1] were tacked on to the Fiscal Cliff bill   NASCAR tax credits, asparagus farmer's assistance and algae biofuel legislation   this one actually matters.[2]<br/> A groundbreaking report from the [3]Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in September explained how dozens of firms   companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and HP\u00a0  exploit existing loopholes in Subpart F to reduce their domestic tax liability, saving billions annually.<br/><br/>Here's how this works. Subpart F of the tax code discusses the requirements companies have for paying U.S. taxes on profits held offshore.\u00a0<br/> Exceptions exist under the current tax regime that allow companies to finagle corporate structure to defer payment of taxes indefinitely.\u00a0<br/> The more exceptions there are to Subpart F, the easier it is for U.S. companies to avoid paying taxes.<br/> U.S. companies hold $1.7 trillion offshore through complex schemes that exploit the loopholes built into Subpart F[4] like the controlled foreign corporation look-through rule and check-the-box regulations.\u00a0<br/> Check-the-box is a Treasury Department policy that has been around since 1997, but the look-through rule was created in 2005.\u00a0<br/> As a result of the loopholes built into Subpart F, companies are able to keep huge portions of their profits and almost all of their cash offshore and away from the IRS by transferring intellectual property rights and patents overseas to low tax shelters.<br/> Often, most of the intellectual property was developed in the United States and the foreign corporations collecting the revenue have a skeleton crew or a P.O. Box[5].\u00a0<br/> Companies like HP[6], Microsoft, Johnson Johnson, Cisco[7] and Coca Cola[8] are able to keep all or almost all of their cash offshore[9] in this way.\u00a0<br/> Fifty pages into the bill[10]\u00a0are sections 322 and 323 which reinstate the tax policies that make this simple.\u00a0<br/> Thanks to Sections 323 and 322 of the Senate's fiscal cliff bill, another year was added to a number of exceptions to Subpart F, giving companies even more leeway to shelter cash offshore and reduce their tax burdens.<br/> So even though the NASCAR, asparagus and algae add ons are sort of funny, this goes to show that there are some pretty big substantive extensions.<br/>Read more about Subpart F loopholes here[11]<br/><br/>Please follow Politics[12] on Twitter[13] and

That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model - in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads - new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model.</p><p>The tax that I propose would be applied to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, which are the key to the operation of Facebook, Google and the like. At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents of the state.</p><p>There are several advantages to using tax legislation, rather than antitrust law or regulation, as a strategy. Senator Elizabeth Warren, for example, has called for breaking up big tech companies. But the antitrust remedies that Ms. Warren and other policy experts are suggesting ask prosecutors and judges to make policy decisions best left to legislatures.Existing antitrust law in the United States addresses mainly the harm from price gouging, not the other kinds of harm caused by these platforms, such as stifling innovation and undermining the institutions of democracy.</p><p>Our digital platforms may not be too big to fail. But they are too big to trust and - despite the call by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, for new legislation and regulation - may already be too big to regulate. Powerful companies can capture or undermine a regulator. The Interstate Commerce Commission, for example, established in the 19th century, ended up serving the interests of the rail and trucking industry instead of the public. And the recent crashes of two Boeing airplanes have raised serious concern that the Federal Aviation Administration, which has a long history as an effective regulator, has been neutered by the aviation industry.</p><p>Of course, companies are incredibly clever about avoiding taxes. But in this case, that's a good thing for all of us. This tax would spur their creativity. Ad-driven platform companies could avoid the tax entirely by switching to the business model that many digital companies already offer: an ad-free subscription. Under this model, consumers know what they give up, and the success of the business would not hinge on tracking customers with ever more sophisticated surveillance techniques. A company could succeed the old-fashioned way: by delivering a service that is worth more than it costs.</p><p>Some corporations will persist with the targeted ad model if it yields more profit, even after paying the tax. To limit the size of those businesses, the tax could be progressive, with higher rates for larger companies. This would have the added benefit of creating a corporate version of a marriage penalty. When two companies combine, their total tax bill would go up.</p><p>A progressive digital ad revenue tax would also make sure that dominant social media platforms bear the brunt of the tax. That's important: It makes it easier for new companies to enter the market, so consumers will have more choices. A new entrant would also be less likely to be acquired if there's a tax penalty. A large company might reduce its tax bill by breaking itself into several smaller companies. It would be up to Congress or state legislatures to decide where to place the thresholds at which higher tax rates kick in.</p><p>If these measures aren't enough, Congress has the power to create new laws that address specific problems. It could follow the Wall Street reforms of Dodd-Frank and define \"systemically important social media platforms\" that would be required to meet stringent transparency standards or be subject to a \"fairness doctrine\" for balanced reporting, similar to what broadcasters once faced.</p><p>From the very beginning, Americans have refused to tolerate unchecked power. We must now press our legislators to protect us from the unchecked power of dominant digital platforms. The bigger they get and the more they know, the greater the threat to our social and political way of life.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006489945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2K-8MB1-JC85-N00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model \u2014 in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads \u2014 new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model.</p><p>The tax that I propose would be applied to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, which are the key to the operation of Facebook, Google and the like. At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents of the state.</p><p>There are several advantages to using tax legislation, rather than antitrust law or regulation, as a strategy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Senator Elizabeth Warren,</url> for example,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">has called for breaking up big tech companies</url>.

But they are too big to trust and \u2014 despite the call by <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook\u2019s chief executive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-regulation-explained.html\">for new legislation and regulation</url> \u2014 may already be too big to regulate. Powerful companies can capture or undermine a regulator. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/us/interstate-commerce-commission-comes-under-siege-in-congress.html\">Interstate Commerce Commission</url>, for example, established in the 19th century, ended up serving the interests of the rail and trucking industry instead of the public. And the recent crashes of two Boeing airplanes have raised serious concern that the Federal Aviation Administration, which has a long history as an effective regulator,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/politics/boeing-faa.html\">has been neutered by the aviation industry</url>.</p><p>Of course, companies are incredibly clever about avoiding taxes. But in this case, that\u2019s a good thing for all of us. This tax would spur their creativity. Ad-driven platform companies could avoid the tax entirely by switching to the business model that many digital companies already offer: an ad-free subscription. Under this model, consumers know what they give up, and the success of the business would not hinge on tracking customers with ever more sophisticated surveillance techniques. A company could succeed the old-fashioned way: by delivering a service that is worth more than it costs.</p><p>Some corporations will persist with the targeted ad model if it yields more profit, even after paying the tax. To limit the size of those businesses, the tax could be progressive, with higher rates for larger companies. This would have the added benefit of creating a corporate version of a marriage penalty. When two companies combine, their total tax bill would go up.</p><p>A progressive digital ad revenue tax would also make sure that dominant social media platforms bear the brunt of the tax. That\u2019s important: It makes it easier for new companies to enter the market, so consumers will have more choices. A new entrant would also be less likely to be acquired if there\u2019s a tax penalty. A large company might reduce its tax bill by breaking itself into several smaller companies. It would be up to Congress or state legislatures to decide where to place the thresholds at which higher tax rates kick in.</p><p>If these measures aren\u2019t enough, Congress has the power to create new laws that address specific problems. It could follow the Wall Street reforms of Dodd-Frank and define \u201csystemically important social media platforms\u201d that would be required to meet stringent transparency standards or be subject to a \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d for balanced reporting, similar to what broadcasters once faced.</p><p>From the very beginning, Americans have refused to tolerate unchecked power. We must now press our legislators to protect us from the unchecked power of dominant digital platforms. The bigger they get and the more they know, the greater the threat to our social and political way of life.</p><p>Paul Romer, a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, advised the Department of Justice in its antitrust case against Microsoft.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model -- in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads -- new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model. </p><p>  The tax that I propose would be applied to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, which are the key to the operation of Facebook, Google and the like. At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents of the state.</p><p>  There are several advantages to using tax legislation, rather than antitrust law or regulation, as a strategy. Senator Elizabeth Warren, for example, has called for breaking up big tech companies. But the antitrust remedies that Ms. Warren and other policy experts are suggesting ask prosecutors and judges to make policy decisions best left to legislatures. Existing antitrust law in the United States addresses mainly the harm from price gouging, not the other kinds of harm caused by these platforms, such as stifling innovation and undermining the institutions of democracy.</p><p>  Our digital platforms may not be too big to fail. But they are too big to trust and -- despite the call by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, for new legislation and regulation -- may already be too big to regulate. Powerful companies can capture or undermine a regulator. The Interstate Commerce Commission, for example, established in the 19th century, ended up serving the interests of the rail and trucking industry instead of the public. And the recent crashes of two Boeing airplanes have raised serious concern that the Federal Aviation Administration, which has a long history as an effective regulator, has been neutered by the aviation industry.</p><p>  Of course, companies are incredibly clever about avoiding taxes. But in this case, that's a good thing for all of us. This tax would spur their creativity. Ad-driven platform companies could avoid the tax entirely by switching to the business model that many digital companies already offer: an ad-free subscription. Under this model, consumers know what they give up, and the success of the business would not hinge on tracking customers with ever more sophisticated surveillance techniques. A company could succeed the old-fashioned way: by delivering a service that is worth more than it costs.</p><p>  Some corporations will persist with the targeted ad model if it yields more profit, even after paying the tax. To limit the size of those businesses, the tax could be progressive, with higher rates for larger companies. This would have the added benefit of creating a corporate version of a marriage penalty. When two companies combine, their total tax bill would go up.</p><p>  A progressive digital ad revenue tax would also make sure that dominant social media platforms bear the brunt of the tax. That's important: It makes it easier for new companies to enter the market, so consumers will have more choices. A new entrant would also be less likely to be acquired if there's a tax penalty. A large company might reduce its tax bill by breaking itself into several smaller companies. It would be up to Congress or state legislatures to decide where to place the thresholds at which higher tax rates kick in.</p><p>  If these measures aren't enough, Congress has the power to create new laws that address specific problems. It could follow the Wall Street reforms of Dodd-Frank and define ''systemically important social media platforms'' that would be required to meet stringent transparency standards or be subject to a ''fairness doctrine'' for balanced reporting, similar to what broadcasters once faced.</p><p>  From the very beginning, Americans have refused to tolerate unchecked power. We must now press our legislators to protect us from the unchecked power of dominant digital platforms. The bigger they get and the more they know, the greater the threat to our social and political way of life.</p><p>  Paul Romer, a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, advised the Department of Justice in its antitrust case against Microsoft.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

China\u2019s tech industry is becoming more serious about grappling with its products\u2019 unintended consequences \u2014 and about helping the government.</p><p>Discussions of technology\u2019s promise were leavened with contemplation of its darker side effects, such as fraud and data breaches. A forum on protecting personal information featured representatives from China\u2019s highest prosecutor and its powerful internet regulator. And several tech companies pledged their support for Beijing\u2019s counterterrorism efforts, even as China faces international criticism for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html\">detaining and indoctrinating Muslims</url> in the name of fighting terrorism in the western region of Xinjiang.</p><p>\u201cTencent has been dedicated to dealing with terrorist information online and other internet crimes, in line with the government\u2019s crackdown,\u201d Chen Yong, an executive in Tencent\u2019s security management department, said at the event.</p><p>The conference, which ends Friday, also reflected some new challenges facing China. It was held at the same time as another big event: a six-day import expo in Shanghai aimed at showing China as a big buyer of foreign goods. With American tariffs threatening to slow a weakening Chinese economy, the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/business/china-xi-trade.html\">spoke at the expo on Monday</url> to proclaim that China could be a positive force in global trade.</p><p>At Wuzhen, by contrast, Mr. Xi appeared only by proxy. The head of the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, Huang Kunming, conveyed a message of thanks from Mr. Xi and then delivered an opening address that extolled the world-changing power of internet access.</p><p>Emissaries from Silicon Valley were also in short supply. Last year, the speakers at Wuzhen included <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/world/asia/china-internet-censorship-wang-huning.html\">Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive</url>, as well as Sundar Pichai of Google. This year, the sole Western tech executive to give a keynote address was Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm.</p><p>His appearance served as a reminder of American companies\u2019 continuing travails in China, which could deepen as the two powers wrestle over high-tech supremacy. Qualcomm<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/technology/qualcomm-nxp-china-deadline.html\">scrapped a $44 billion deal</url> to buy a Dutch chip manufacturer this year after China\u2019s antitrust authorities declined to approve it, a move widely viewed as retaliation in the trade war.</p><p>Among Chinese companies this week, private enterprises showed off the ways in which they increasingly support and work with the government, while state-backed companies demonstrated they were not doomed to be tech laggards.</p><p>The Tencent executive, Mr. Chen, described in an interview the company\u2019s relationship with law enforcement.</p><p>Political activists have reported being followed based on what they have said on WeChat. Chat records have turned up as evidence in court, fueling speculation about whether Tencent, the app\u2019s developer, may be the source.</p><p>Mr. Chen said Tencent reports illegal activity discovered on its platforms to the government, after which the authorities can request specific user information. Metadata describing when and where users logged into a Tencent app can be stored for up to six months, he said. But Mr. Chen denied that the company gave law enforcement officials a back door through which they could freely peruse chat records and user data.</p><p>\u201cWe only store the content that the law prescribes,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever long the law says to store it, that\u2019s how long we store it. Whatever the law says to store, that\u2019s what we store.\u201d</p><p>In the conference\u2019s exhibition halls, there were lighter touches to be found. A company called Utry let loose several eager, if herky-jerky, robots that followed people around on wheels, offering to carry their bags. Kuaishou, the maker of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/technology/china-censor-teen-moms.html\">popular video app</url>, demonstrated its facial-recognition prowess by scanning visitors\u2019 faces and then, within seconds, displaying who in its vast video library most resembled them. (The results varied.)</p><p>Facial recognition is a hot area in Chinese tech, providing the technology behind both funny video selfies and smart surveillance cameras. One company attending the conference is taking things a step further.</p><p>IrisKing, which is based in Beijing and has substantial state backing, started out by making iris-recognition software for coal mines. With their faces and fingertips covered in soot, miners needed another technology for clocking in and out of work.</p><p>Now, IrisKing\u2019s tools also help identify refugees in Syria and recover trafficked children in China, said Wang Xintao, a marketing manager for the company.</p><p>The company has also started working with the authorities in Xinjiang, Mr. Wang said. The goal? To have a database of the irises of all Xinjiang residents within two years, he said.</p><p>Carolyn Zhang contributed research. </p><p>PHOTO: Facial recognition is a hot area in Chinese tech, furthering the development of both funny video selfies and smart surveillance cameras.

Although by 2019 the general forecast is that the Mexican economy will grow just above zero, in Citi the prospect is that there will be a recovery from next year. According to a fortnightly survey of Banamex, the average estimates that this year Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be 0.4%.</p><p><br/>C\u00e9sar Rojas, global economist of the US financial group, stressed that, globally, the biggest risk is the u.S.-China trade war, which could impact different economies, even if it would be lower in Mexico and could even take advantage of that situation if it continued.<br/>\"We expect an uptick in growth for the next year,\" he said.<br/>At the 2019 Citi Media Summit in this city, the economist detailed that the expected growth for the United States is 2% by 2020, which would at the same time push the Mexican economy, given the high degree of relationship between the two.<br/>He acknowledged that there is uncertainty today given the public policies of the new government, but stressed that there is stability in public finances, as well as confidence from both consumers and a certain business sector.<br/>\"In Mexico what we have seen, and it is something that has been seen with other economies, is that uncertainty generates a potential delay in investment. While there are issues that need to be improved such as security, there is generally a positive outlook. We see higher growth next year,\" he said.<br/>He said, \"Growth at the start of an administration, we've seen it in past episodes, it's low since they start taking the reins of the economy and you start to see how to adjust the different variables. So we still see a positive outlook for next year.\"<br/>Citi's global economist highlighted the U.S.-China trade war as the main risk to the world economy, but he said Mexico would be undershocked and even, he said, could benefit from diversifying trade.<br/>What it did think the government should do is maintain measures such as sound public finances, so that the local economy starts to pick up.<br/>\"One important thing is that the administration in Mexico has been quite conservative in terms of public finance care. So, in that sense, maintaining that same approach to the next year will be a positive thing, especially given the risks (...) if somehow our scenario of a low likelihood of global recession occurs, Mexico would have to take the measures to strengthen domestic demand, continue strong public finances and be able to give certainty to investments,\" he said.<br/>It keeps the appeal<br/>For his part, Eduardo Cruz, director of citi's corporate investment banking for Latin America, agreed that Mexico remains attractive to international investors because of its proximity to the United States and the large economy it represents.<br/>\"I don't think anyone is expecting it to be composed overnight and therefore the direction of policy and decisions is more important to show the market that something is being done. There are certain steps that are starting to be done. Our expectation is that in the next 12 or 14 months, if things continue, there will be interesting things and member investments in Mexico.\"<br/>ComplementaryFintech, allies to improve financial services<br/>At the 2019 Citi Media Summit, executives of this bankAmerican emphasized the importance of fintech and other technology options to deliver better financial products and services and improve the customer experience. In fact, they agreed that fintech, and even big tech are complementary in a market where there are many opportunities to serve people with banking services.<br/>Driss Temsamani, head of Digital Channels and Data of Citi, emphasized that fintech are leading growth in Latin America, especially in markets such as Mexico and Brazil.<br/>He commented that by 2025 the total data on the Internet will be 175 zettabytes, and of these 30% will be consumed in real time, and 40% will be in the cloud. He also highlighted the growing number of cell phones in the region.<br/>All this, he said, represents great opportunities for banks, but also for fintech and even big tech. In fact, he mentioned the Citi Ventures fund that the bank has to support these types of startups.<br/>Citi's value proposition, he added, are technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biometrics, and others.<br/>Steve Donovan, Citi's head of treasury and trading solutions for Latin America, commented that one of the bank's guidelines is to invest in platforms that enhance the customer experience.<br/>He agreed that big tech is very significant, and that if you work together, there can be reciprocal benefits.<br/>Evolution<br/>Gabriel Kirestian, Citi's chief payments officer for Latin America, also stressed the importance of fintech, and stated that both are collaborating and co-creating.<br/>He noted that, as in other topics, customers are hoping for payments to be faster on a par with insurance, so he felt fintech will help transform the means of payment.<br/>He argued that regulation will consolidate the region's ecosystem. \"Partnering with fintech is key to transforming payment methods.\"<br/>At the 2019 Citi Media Summit, Andre Salgado, Citi Latin America's information security officer, put the issue of cybersecurity on the table, which, he said, is a growing risk in Latin America.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8914918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7J-YRC1-JBJN-M1HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002R8O</classCode><className>GRUPO FINANCIERO BANAMEX/ACCIVAL SA DE CV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

At this year's edition of this conference, it could also refer to the reputation of certain large technology companies crashing into a wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And no large technology company took more hits here than Facebook. Speaker after speaker took the social network to task for its vast influence and inability to address such persistent problems as fake users \u2013 whom Facebook itself said Wednesday make up an estimated 5% of monthly active accounts.</p><p> \"In a lot of ways, Facebook is too powerful,\" summed up former Facebook chief information security officer Alex Stamos in a talk Tuesday with tech pundit Kara Swisher. (Yes, that's a Facebook video link.)</p><p> Stamos urged governments to curb the ability of political actors to target individuals precisely using Facebook, citing not just Russian influence operations in the 2016 election but the Obama campaign's groundbreaking social-media marketing in 2012 \u2013 \"probably the first U.S. election that was quote-unquote thrown by Facebook.\"</p><p> Stamos further suggested that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg hand over his role as CEO to a more seasoned outsider and named one candidate: Microsoft president Brad Smith, who has become an outspoken advocate for regulation of such technologies as facial-recognition software.</p><p> Should we ban facial recognition?: From companies to cities, debate over privacy rages on</p><p> Car keys: Subaru Outback revamped for 2020, with facial recognition</p><p> Stamos, now a professor at Stanford University, also had a request for large tech companies in general: Stop compensating people with stock, which winds up letting Wall Street dictate employee incentives.</p><p> \"Eighty-something percent of my compensation at Facebook was set by Wall Street,\" he said of his time there.</p><p> But while Stamos allowed that breaking up Facebook \u2013 and forcing Google to divest YouTube \u2013 might be justified under antitrust grounds, that remedy wouldn't stop disinformation campaigns.</p><p> \"You can't solve climate change by breaking up ExxonMobil and making 10 ExxonMobils,\" he said.</p><p> Other Collision speakers agreed about the problem of tech concentration. Sonos' CEO described the notion of win-win \"coopetition\" between smaller firms such as his and the tech giants as \"Big Tech wins and you get to survive.\" Mozilla chief innovation officer Katharina Borchert commented that \"unfortunately, the Internet is almost synonymous with a number of large companies.\"</p><p> Tech arrogance also got called out. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said Monday night that \"We can't just race forward into the future for a few with the tech brilliance we have in this room and sort of shrug at everyone who's being left behind.\"</p><p> Zuckerberg responds: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says breaking up social network wouldn't help</p><p> Wait, is that video real?: The race against deepfakes and dangers of manipulated recordings</p><p> Wednesday, Cisco chairman emeritus John Chambers said, \"Silicon Valley made a terrible mistake in telling a large part of the U.S. 'get used to it'.\"</p><p> But this conference, which drew an announced 25,711 attendees, mostly left regulatory or other remedies as an exercise for the spectator.</p><p> After denouncing the recent course of Facebook (and admitting that \"my firm profited enormously\" from its investments in that company), Elevation Partners co-founder Roger McNamee suggested that \"Facebook and Google have left governments with no choice but to do what Sri Lanka did.\"</p><p> Forcibly shutting down entire social networks as that country did after the Easter Sunday bombings would trample civil liberties on either side of the Atlantic.</p><p> Oculus virtual-reality founder Palmer Luckey, now CEO of the defense contractor Anduril Industries, threw cold water on the hope that tech founders would turn to what Chambers described as \"capitalism with a social conscience.\"</p><p> \"You will not be able to get rid of him,\" Luckey said Wednesday of Zuckerberg, whom he said fired him after his funding of a pro-Donald Trump internet trolling operation in 2016 became public knowledge. \"People should cope with that reality rather than believe that there is some way out of that situation.\"</p><p> ---</p><p> Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

At this year's edition of this conference, it could also refer to the reputation of certain large technology companies crashing into a wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And no large technology company took more hits here than Facebook. Speaker after speaker took the social network to task for its vast influence and inability to address such persistent problems as fake users \u2013 whom Facebookitself said Wednesday make up an estimated 5% of monthly active accounts.</p><p> \"In a lot of ways, Facebookis too powerful,\" summed up former Facebookchief information security officer Alex Stamos in a talk Tuesday with tech pundit Kara Swisher. (Yes, that's a Facebook video link.)</p><p> Stamos urged governments to curb the ability of political actors to target individuals precisely using Facebook, citing not just Russian influence operations in the 2016 election but the Obama campaign's groundbreaking social-media marketing in 2012 \u2013 \"probably the first U.S. election that was quote-unquote thrown by Facebook.\"</p><p> Stamos further suggested that Facebookfounder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>hand over his role as CEO to a more seasoned outsider and named one candidate: Microsoft president Brad Smith, who has become an outspoken advocate for regulation of such technologies as facial-recognition software.</p><p> Should we ban facial recognition?: From companies to cities, debate over privacy rages on</p><p> Car keys: Subaru Outback revamped for 2020, with facial recognition</p><p> Stamos, now a professor at Stanford University, also had a request for large tech companies in general: Stop compensating people with stock, which winds up letting Wall Street dictate employee incentives.</p><p> \"Eighty-something percent of my compensation at Facebookwas set by Wall Street,\" he said of his time there.</p><p> But while Stamos allowed that breaking up Facebook\u2013 and forcing Google to divest YouTube \u2013 might be justified under antitrust grounds, that remedy wouldn't stop disinformation campaigns.</p><p> \"You can't solve climate change by breaking up ExxonMobil and making 10 ExxonMobils,\" he said.</p><p> Other Collision speakers agreed about the problem of tech concentration. Sonos' CEO described the notion of win-win \"coopetition\" between smaller firms such as his and the tech giants as \"Big Tech wins and you get to survive.\" Mozilla chief innovation officer Katharina Borchert commented that \"unfortunately, the Internet is almost synonymous with a number of large companies.\"</p><p> Tech arrogance also got called out.

What's less well known is just how important a landmark it is on the annual Big Tech circuit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just that a gamut of big-ticket executives are there: Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Huawei's Ren Zhengfei, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and so on. Many of the companies actually take over a shop on Davos' main street, setting up a showroom to entertain clients, beguile civil-society participants and pacify political leaders.</p><p>Google's party is the stuff of late-night Davos legend; and an invitation into the Facebook pavilion, right in the centre of the action, is a hot ticket. Huawei's shopfront seems to get bigger and brighter every year.</p><p>It's a chance for the less immediately recognisable brands to strut their stuff, too: cloud computing provider Salesforce had a shopfront on each side of the street this year, and reportedly had Lenny Kravitz as the musical drawcard for its party. Website security company Cloudflare had a prime corner location and Jason Derulo as the party trick.</p><p>But there's a serious side, too. With the world supposedly watching on - a broader audience than just the usual techerati - it's a moment to try and polish tarnished reputations, to shape debate and perceptions about the industry.</p><p>Most years, the panel discussions and the talks hosted in the shopfronts are pretty techno-utopian. The fourth industrial revolution is coming to save the world, that sort of thing.</p><p>This year, though, although the general \"mood of Davos\" was relatively upbeat, the tech side was a little more downcast and defensive. Nadella excepted, most of the CEOs were less visible in the public forums. The shopfronts seemed a little quieter.</p><p>One tech executive at a private party lamented to The Australian Financial Review that it felt as though the sector had thrown in the towel. \"They seem to have given up trying to restore their reputations,\" he said. \"That apathy, or complacency, is dangerous.\"</p><p>That's one way of seeing it. Another might be that there was a de facto collective decision that this was a year for soft-soaping and circumspection rather than front-foot defence.</p><p>The regulatory environment hangs in the balance: digital taxes; regulation of content - billionaire George Soros called Facebook an agent of Trump; new European rules on artificial intelligence; further fallout from the US-China trade and tech war; and the risk that climate change and climate regulation will existentially threaten business models. Better to don the hair shirt than risk having to reach for the flak jacket.</p><p>Pichai was the master of this approach. \"We have to be clear-eyed about these powerful technologies. This is why we need to be deliberate, and to regulate technologies like AI, and society needs to engage on it,\" he said in his Davos keynote.</p><p>A theme that stood out at Davos was the growing clout of the European Union as a de facto standard setter. Once a market of 500 million people has issued rules, there's an incentive for a global company to use that as a default setting.</p><p>Pichai, for one, welcomes our new European overlords. \"It's encouraging to see AI and sustainability as their [the EU's] top priorities,\" he said.</p><p>The EU's white paper on AI was \"an important first step\", and the General Data Protection Regulation had been \"a great template - it's given a standardised privacy framework, ... I'm very glad the EU took the lead on it\".</p><p>Another recurrent discussion was the risk that China and the US would bifurcate the future of technology, ushering in polarisation or fragmentation, and undermining prosperity.</p><p>Israeli polymath Yuval Noah Harari warned of an \"arms race\", in which competing companies and states were tempted to use their vast data reserves to manipulate individual human decision-making, or choose the dark side when it came to melding IT and biotech.</p><p>Huawei's Ren was optimistic tech wouldn't be abused this way - though he did add the ominous rider \"at this point in time\".</p><p>He also thought it was unlikely that you could bifurcate the world of technological development, as science and the market would converge, a la Darwin, on the fittest.</p><p>Nadella was more anxious about China-US tech splits, worrying whether global norms around the use of technology could develop in that environment.</p><p>All up, it wasn't an easy year to be a tech titan at Davos. But Nadella, for one, tried to project sanguinity.</p><p>\"Technology is so much part of our lives...that I think it [scrutiny] just goes with the territory. Every other industry has had to deal with it perhaps a lot more in the past. And we will have to do so now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc790xk99xzkpwlxy6ewl</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3H-GT01-JD34-V1RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

CEO Henry Blodget[2] hosted a panel at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos[3] titled \"Learning Today for Tomorrow's Jobs[4].\" The panel comprised executives, labor leaders, and a renowned academic, who debated the extent of involvement for the public and private sectors in assisting workers through what WEF calls the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" The panel found that the transformation of industries should inspire action, but not hopelessness. All panel members agreed that now is the time to develop job education programs for existing employees and to further embrace alternatives to four-year university[5] education. </p><p>This article is part of Business Insider's ongoing series on Better Capitalism[6]. The developed world is undergoing a period of rapid transformation yet again, and this means that workers, governments, and corporations are going to have to adapt so that they're not left behind. World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab thinks the scale and speed at which changes like artificial intelligence-powered automation are taking place warrants the label of the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution[7].\" While it's easy for an elite class to be hopeful around changes that will likely make their businesses more efficient and productive, it's upsetting for the average worker to constantly hear that robots will be replacing millions of jobs. Some of this fear is based on how much is unknown: There are plenty of estimates tossed around, but the bottom line is no one knows for certain which jobs will be obsolete in 10 years[8], and which new ones will emerge. After surveying 33,000 people around the world for its latest annual trust survey[9], the global communications firm Edelman found that 59% of employees worry about not having the training and skills necessary for a well-paying job and 55% worry automation and other tech will make their job obsolete. In the hopes of finding some solutions to alleviate these fears, Henry Blodget, the cofounder and CEO of Business Insider's parent company Insider, Inc., had a discussion with top labor leaders, executives, and a renowned academic at WEF's annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Blodget's panel, \"Learning Today for Tomorrow's Jobs[10]\" included: Adam Grant[11], bestselling author and professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania Christy Hoffman[12], general secretary of the Switzerland-based global union federation UNI Global Union Julie Gebauer[13], head of human capital and benefits at the United Kingdom-based insurance brokerage and consulting firm Willis Towers Watson Bill Thomas[14], global chairman of the Netherlands-based professional services company KPMG Guy Ryder[15], director-general of the United Nations agency the International Labour Organization (ILO) They debated the means of implementation and the extent of responsibilities of the public and private sectors, as well as the workers themselves, but all panel members agreed that to thrive in this global shift, job training must be a lifetime commitment, and that the responsibility should not be solely placed on the worker. It's a time for action, the panel agreed, not giving up.\"We've seen shifts like this before; we've gotten through them,\" Blodget said. We've collected highlights from the discussion, to find out how to get through this current shift. Wharton professor Adam Grant said we should be 'worried but not panicked,' and our response should be taking internal training more seriously. World Economic ForumGrant said history is repeating itself, in terms of how jobs will be replaced and new ones created. For him, a hypothetical world where everyone gets a college degree before entering the workforce would not lead to a solution. While he recognizes the value of a thorough education as a foundation for particular careers \u2014 and he is not saying we replace it for everyone \u2014 the current shift requires a new focus on skills. He said a discussion with eyeglasses company Warby Parker showed him how to do it well. When the chief technology officer had a difficult time attracting a software engineer due to a crowded job market with big tech companies, his assistant said she could figure out a solution to a coding challenge he was facing. He then decided they would train his assistant to fill that engineer role. Grant said the CTO has done another internal retraining since then, due to the success of the first one. \"If I were running a company, the first thing I would do is I'd make a list of all the skills that I can't fill from the outside,\" Grant said. \"I'd create a set of job descriptions, and then some training programs internally. And I'd let my own employees sign up to teach them as well as to take them, so that I don't have to move linearly through one ladder but I can actually rotate.\"UNI Global Union general secretary Christy Hoffman said we need tripartite solutions involving unions, business, and governments. World Economic ForumHoffman's organization represents 20 million workers in the service industry, and she said that while some corporations have recognized the need for internal retraining, there are simply some employees who are not on paths that will get them necessary training and will therefore be left behind. \"There will be people who are displaced,\" she said, and so solutions determined through the cooperation of unions with policymakers and employers \"make sure that as people navigate the change, there is support for appropriate reskilling.\" She acknowledged the weak state of unions in the US, but asserted that collective bargaining needs to play a strong role in negotiating the terms of what employees need to be trained in, and how they will be trained.ILO director-general Guy Ryder said there needs to be 'an entitlement to lifelong learning.' World Economic ForumIn a new report[16], the ILO calls for \"recognition of a universal entitlement to lifelong learning and the establishment of an effective lifelong learning system\" \u2014 that is, nations should recognize that the way the workforce is evolving in the developed world, learning cannot end after high school or college. It's time, Ryder said, to focus on what works rather than getting lost in statistical estimates about lost jobs, or behaving as if there will be no work left in the near future. For him, that means, among other things, nations and corporations seriously considering new apprenticeship programs, which can be modeled on successful ones like those in Switzerland and Germany, which on average yield returns on investment. In Switzerland, for example, a teenager can enroll in three- or four-year apprenticeships while simultaneously completing their schooling, and end up with a nationally recognized, portable certification and a job from their sponsor. For this to work in another country, the framework has to be established by the government, and companies must agree to regulations and standards. It works,\" he said. \"And it works very, very well.\"See the rest of the story at Business Insider[17] See Also: An MIT researcher who analyzed facial recognition software found eliminating bias in

In what other ways has your reporting influenced how you think about and use technology in your personal life?</p><p>I\u2019ve written a lot about the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/style/how-can-i-focus-better.html\">attention economy</url> \u2014 everything on the internet that is trying to grab our ears and eyeballs for profit, including the big social media platforms \u2014 and it\u2019s made me really aware of where I put my own attention, and the ways I\u2019m being manipulated in the background. I\u2019ve gotten really protective of my attention, and I get self-conscious when I catch myself in a YouTube spiral, or find myself mindlessly swiping through Instagram stories.</p><p>I\u2019ve also become less of a gadget nerd than I once was. I used to buy all the newest phones and accessories, deck out my house in connected devices and try all the latest apps. But I\u2019ve seen so many buggy launches that now I usually wait for version 2.0, and I\u2019ve watched enough tech trends come and go that it\u2019s become hard to put too much faith in any one thing. </p><p>What are you most excited for and worried about in the world of technology right now?</p><p>On the positive side, I\u2019m excited that technology is getting the attention it deserves, and that after years of operating with cheerful impunity, big tech companies are finally being scrutinized by regulators, the media and their own employees. </p><p>But I\u2019m also excited about a lot of smaller, less headline-grabbing developments. For the last two years, I\u2019ve given out \u201cGood Tech Awards\u201d to tech projects that are actually making the world a better place \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/technology/year-in-technology-2018.html\">the 2018 edition</url> featured blood-delivering drones, decarceration start-ups, and researchers calling out racial and gender bias in artificial intelligence systems, among other things. It\u2019s one of my favorite pieces to write, and reminds me that lots of technologists are still out there doing good.</p><p>On the worry side, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but I\u2019m nervous about A.I. and automation. I\u2019m not worried about the machines themselves \u2014 at least not in the Terminator, killer-robot sense. I\u2019m worried about the political and economic system into which we\u2019re deploying this new, world-changing technology, and whether it\u2019s too late to rejigger things so we don\u2019t end up with a truly dystopian outcome.</p><p>What is the best news tip you\u2019ve ever received?</p><p>I\u2019m not sure about \u201cbest,\u201d but the most random tip I\u2019ve ever gotten was probably the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack. It came to me as an unsolicited email from someone (whom we now know was likely a North Korean hacker) who called himself \u201cthe boss of G.O.P.\u201d and included a link to a trove of documents. It looked like spam, but I opened it on a whim and was shocked to find 26 folders of internal Sony Pictures documents inside, including spreadsheets containing the salaries of all their executives.</p><p>How does it feel after you publish a big story? What do you do?</p><p>Hmm, let\u2019s see. After I publish a big story, I usually step out onto my terrace, draw a few deep, contented breaths, crack open a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and spend the rest of the day basking in the satisfaction of a job well done.</p><p>I\u2019m kidding. Obviously, I spend the hour after a story is published frantically refreshing Twitter, looking for affirmation from complete strangers and measuring my self-worth by their instantaneous judgments. I\u2019m not a lunatic.</p><p>Actually, it usually feels equal parts great and awful to publish a big story. Great because you\u2019re done, which is nice, but then you wait in agony as the world absorbs and digests what you\u2019ve written and tells you that your entire thesis is wrong, or you\u2019ve mixed up 4chan and 8chan, or you wrote that the concept of a \u201cnon-playable character\u201d came from video games when it really originated in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. (I got dozens of emails about that one.) On the rare occasions when the reception to a piece is overwhelmingly positive, I allow myself to bask in it, although I sometimes suspect there\u2019s been some sort of glitch \u2014 maybe the experts are all on vacation this week?</p><p>I\u2019m lucky to write for an intelligent and attentive audience, and I do get a lot of great and genuinely helpful feedback. I also write a lot about horrible parts of the internet, so once in a while my inbox and Twitter feed get flooded with trolls and bigots calling me a \u201cfake news moron from the New York Slimes\u201d (or worse). On those occasions, I try to take a few hours off from the internet and let the cycle run its course.</p><p>How do you spend your time when you\u2019re off duty?</p><p>My newest extracurricular is ceramics. Earlier this year, I started taking pottery classes, and it\u2019s been \u2014 as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html\">Gwyneth Paltrow</url> as this sounds \u2014 totally healing and restorative. Making something with your hands is incredibly satisfying, and forcing yourself to get away from screens and learn a new skill is something I wish I\u2019d done years ago.</p><p>Other than pottery, I like cooking, music, walking my dog in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, doing the crossword puzzle and reading the New Yorkers that pile up on my kitchen table. I used to play a lot of video games, but I had to kick that habit \u2014 it was turning my brain into pudding.</p><p>A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/section/reader-center\">Reader Center</url> does not count toward your monthly free article limit.</p><p>Follow the <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/readercenter\">@ReaderCenter</url> on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Luis Maz\u00f3n FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006427864</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9H-P3N1-DXY4-X0KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><timeReceived>12:34 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Roose, Kevin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Roose, Kevin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Careers and Professions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News and News Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

Take a Number</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Donavon Smallwood for The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Oracle and the Handpulled Noodle would seem to have little in common. One is a multibillion-dollar software company in Silicon Valley with tens of thousands of employees all over the world. The other is a small Harlem spot that serves Chinese comfort food and is known for its tasty dumplings. But they both say Google is unfairly hurting their businesses, and they have a new audience in Washington eager to hear about it. After years of showing little interest, Congress and regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department plan to scrutinize the power, influence and market dominance of Google, as well as fellow tech giants Amazon, Apple and Facebook. \"Obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\" President Trump said about large tech companies in an interview on CNBC on Monday. Scores of other tech companies and critics, as varied as software firms and shoemakers or musicians and newspapers, have stewed for years over how, they say, some of the biggest tech firms have used their power and scale to bully them and upend their businesses. The government is finally listening. \"We're in the moment where regulators hang a shingle and say, 'we're open,'\" said Luther Lowe, the policy chief at the reviews site Yelp and the loudest antitrust antagonist against Google. \"The dozens of companies who have been quietly venting in Silicon Valley can begin to form a single-file line around the D.O.J.\" The venting goes well beyond Silicon Valley. When the F.T.C. asked for comments last year on whether the modern economy required a new approach to consumer protection and competition, the commission received more than 750 letters, many targeting the big tech companies. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, the lobbying group that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers, complained that the internet was now at the center of consumers' decision-making and \"controlled by a relatively small number of highly influential firms.\" Sixteen advocacy groups and think tanks jointly wrote a manifesto that argued for tough antitrust enforcement against the tech giants, accusing them of a wide swath of misbehavior, including mishandling people's data, crippling small retailers or causing internet addiction. And the Handpulled Noodle, echoing complaints from other small businesses, told the F.T.C. that Google sells ads on its listing in search results. The ads direct customers to delivery apps that charge steep fees and cut into the restaurant's already thin profit margins. \"As a small business, it's like David versus Goliath,\" said Andrew Ding, the owner of the Handpulled Noodle. The shop's Google listing is how most customers find his restaurant, yet, he said, he has no control over how his business is represented. There is no way for him to get rid of the ad next to the Google listing. \"Google is it,\" Mr. Ding said in an interview. \"I would love for small business owners that don't have the clout or the influence to have more say about how their business is represented.\" Google said it allowed companies to place ads next to the listings of other businesses to give users more options. The Justice Department is examining complaints against Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. will handle antitrust issues related to Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust also announced plans for an investigation into whether the tech companies stifled competition and hurt consumers. The first hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. In Europe, the authorities have been far tougher on the four tech giants. They have imposed about $9.3 billion (8.2 billion euros) in fines against Google in three separate antitrust cases since 2017. They concluded that Google had forced phone makers to preinstall its apps, favored its own services over rivals in search results, and imposed unfair terms on companies that use its search services. In his interview on Monday on CNBC, Mr. Trump said European regulators saw \"easy money\" in levying large fines against American firms. \"They are actually attacking our companies, but we should be doing what they are doing,\" he said. News Corp and Axel Springer, the biggest German publisher, have voiced concerns to European regulators about the influence of Google and Facebook over the news business. The publishers lobbied heavily for a new European Union-wide copyright law, passed in March, requiring that large internet platforms pay a license for content shared on services like Google News. Oracle and Yelp have also taken their complaints to Europe. Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president and policy chief, said that Google's dominance of the market underpinning online ads had enabled it to stifle competition, including from Oracle. \"We'd like to be bigger. But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,\" Mr. Glueck said. There is a bit of a revenge back story to Oracle's complaints about Google: The two companies have been locked in a nine-year patent battle with billions of dollars at stake. Yelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site. In 2013, the F.T.C. closed an investigation into Google's search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes. \"For so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren't critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,\" Yelp's Mr. Lowe said. The European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon last September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them. A central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their platforms because that's where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions. Apple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30 percent of revenue made through activity inside the app. Spotify recently argued to European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify's app and favor Apple's competing service. Apple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify's app is when it \"tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\" Apple said in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn't get a cut. News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But to appear high on those sites, the publishers have said both companies have encouraged them to use technologies that make Google and Facebook destinations for news instead of the news sites themselves. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams. Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue. Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and has committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news. Musicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. \"Hopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,\" said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters. Google has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify. Some companies that sell goods on Amazon have argued that they have to be on its site to reach customers. Yet they fret that Amazon can use data about their sales to develop its own competing products. The trade group for major shoe brands, including Nike, Crocs and Dr. Martens, asked the F.T.C. to look into the \"dual role\" of platforms like Amazon. An Amazon executive, Jeff Wilke, said at an event last week that those in-house brands were \"a tiny fraction\" of Amazon sales. \"We do not allow anyone inside Amazon to have access to individual sellers' data in order to build a private-label product,\" he said. A Senate hearing last month offered a preview of the potential drama to come in Washington. Brian O'Kelley, founder of an ad-technology company called AppNexus, testified that in 2008 he invented an automated bidding system for advertisers that \"turned every ad on the internet into a real-time auction.\" AppNexus grew to 600 employees. \"Google's response to the threat from AppNexus was that of a classic monopolist,\" he said. Google told AppNexus clients that they would need to also use Google's ad technology if they wanted to serve ads on YouTube, he testified. AppNexus's business slumped and it laid off 100 employees in 2016. AT&amp;T bought it last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRFWK-281838dc6f949a9d816165174b6c1e18790e8c0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRFWK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-MTX1-JBCN-41YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387629</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger spoke about the issue at South by Southwest, with Systrom saying that \"a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone's current feeling of anti-tech rather than doing what politicians should do, which is address real problems and give real solutions.\"The Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation also criticised the plans, saying that \"breaking up large Internet companies just because they are large won't help consumers. It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services.\"However, the\u00c2\u00a0Open Markets Institute has said that the proposal is\u00c2\u00a0\"of fundamental importance to all Americans.\"The industry's response to breaking up Big TechAccording to anonymous chat app Blind, the proposals have had support from the technology industry itself.Blind, which carries out polls to show the opinions of employees, put the issue to tech workers, asking them to respond to the question \"Should Amazon, Facebook and Google be broken up?\"</p><p>A total of 6,082 answered the survey question regarding breaking up Big Tech and although 63.94% of respondents answered no, a significant number of people, 36.06%, answered yes.Unsurprisingly, the companies named in the question finished with the lowest percentage of employees answering with yes. Only 17.55% of Google employees were in favour, followed by Facebook with 17.59%, and Amazon with 22.89%.The three companies with the highest percentage of employees answering yes were Lyft with 45.68%, Salesforce with 46.34%, and eBay with 47.44%.This suggests that many within the industry are in favour of greater regulation to ensure that big tech is not allowed to further increase its influence at the expense of competition.In recent months, there has been calls for governments to take action to rein in Big Tech, with\u00c2\u00a0The House of Lords Communications Committee publishing a report proposing\u00c2\u00a0 a new Digital Authority to oversee this regulation and UK Government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee published its report on fake news and misinformation, calling for an online a\u00c2\u00a0code of conduct.It remains to be seen whether the US will follow suit, and if Warren's proposal will come to fruition, but if tighter regulation is introduced, the industry may be more in favour of breaking up Big Tech than it may appear.\u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-950DA364BDF5416BAE2DEFEAEE2CA1E8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPB-S001-JC0X-H12D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><timeReceived>6:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In doing so, the president, , entering the 2020 presidential election, also sought to rally his widely followed online allies, whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" that together can reach  half a billion people.</p><p>\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his winding diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social-media meme makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president actually aimed to use the policy summit as a re-election push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed their controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter  declined  comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides  lined the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for a meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" </p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as Twitter removes spam.</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media - and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0097593589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-2P91-DY37-F0FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In doing so, the president, , entering the 2020 presidential election, also sought to rally his widely followed online allies, whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" that together can reach  half a billion people.</p><p>\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his winding diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social-media meme makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president actually aimed to use the policy summit as a re-election push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed their controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter  declined  comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides  lined the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for a meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" </p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as Twitter removes spam.</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media - and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0097593808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-2P91-DY37-F0CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

In doing so, the president,, entering the 2020 presidential election, also sought to rally his widely followed online allies, whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" that together can reach half a billion people.</p><p>\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his winding diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter -- charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied -- at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social-media meme makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president actually aimed to use the policy summit as a re-election push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed their controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides lined the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech -- along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for a meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\"</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as Twitter removes spam.</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media -- and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black.\" ct19 0092 190712 N S 0000000000 00005039</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: President Donald Trump addressed social media provocateurs on Thursday.

Mark Warner, D-Va. \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter  declined  comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides  lined the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for a meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" </p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as Twitter removes spam.</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media - and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALSNN-BS0097599209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-WK21-JBM5-R19Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Baltimore Sun Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Baltimore Sun</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It says Russia must be banned from international  athletics.  We have full coverage.</p><p>The president of the world's largest airline tells CNN there are many  airports where security is weak.</p><p>And MTN's chief executive resigns on accusations it didn't do enough  to prevent terrorists using its network.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest.  We start a new week together.  And I mean  business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST:  Good evening.  Tonight:  it's a deeply rooted culture of  cheating at all levels.  Those are the words from the World Athletic  Corporation, which faces a corruption scandal that threatens to overshadow  the one at FIFA in terms of seriousness and scale.  </p><p>The world's antidoping agency says it's uncovered what amounts to, in  their words, \"state-sponsored doping\" in Russia.  And it has called for  Russia to be suspended from the 2016 Olympics.  </p><p>It is an extraordinary story tonight.  It says that the -- Russia  should be -- faces a ban, that the 2012 Olympics sabotaged by failure to  crack down on doping cheat -- that was the London Olympics in 2012 -- and  it says there is evidence of corruption and bribery, which has now been  sent to Interpol.  </p><p>So Russia facing a ban; London Olympics sabotaged; Interpol is now  investigating.  </p><p>Dick Pound, who led the investigation, has called the findings \"very  damaging.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK POUND, CHAIRMAN, WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY:  It is worse than we  thought.  It has the effect, unlike other forms of corruption, of actually  affecting the results on the field of play.  And athletes, both in Russia  and abroad, are suffering as a result of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Joining me now, Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow for us  tonight, and \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell, who is at the CNN Center.  </p><p>We'll begin with you, Don, if we may.</p><p>I read large parts of the long report today.  It is breathtaking in  its detail and mind-boggling in its level of corruption and miscreant  behavior.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  And for all that those, what,  300 pages in all this detail, they're saying that this could well be just  the tip of the iceberg.  It could be more than Russia, it could be more  than athletics.  But they were given a very narrow brief with regard to the  investigation they could do.</p><p>And what they've come up with incredibly damaging to Russia and for  the sport of athletics, for which the stakes just couldn't be any higher,  Richard.  If you were to ask people, you know, your ordinary man on the  street, which sport have athletes who cheat, they would say maybe cycling  but probably athletics.</p><p>So this is a problem that goes way back.  But if the sport is going to  tackle it, it has to be tackled now.  And you're talking about in Russia,  not just athletes but coaches, trainers, doctors -- the entire institution,  it stinks.</p><p>QUEST:  Don, as I -- so we have the coaches and the trainers providing  the doping, the enhanced performance doping.  We have the laboratories  falsifying results when they know, in their words, the specimen is dirty  and they're falsifying it.</p><p>And we have the state conniving in all of this.  But I get the  impression that everybody has known this for some time.  </p><p>What are people like Seb Coe and International Athletics now saying?  </p><p>RIDDELL:  Well, there's an awful lot of pressure on the IAAF and Seb  Coe in particular.  He's the new president.  He's only been in charge for a  few months.  People are now asking what he knew.  He was the vice president  of the IAAF for seven years.  Now he's in charge.  </p><p>And he's got to try and get this thing sorted out right now.  He has  said he will stop at nothing to make sure that they get to the bottom of  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN COE, IAAF PRESIDENT:  Look, I realize I've been criticized  for that, those remarks I made within moments of winning a campaign.  And  it also presupposes --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>COE:  -- I had a list of allegations sitting in front of me.  I did  not.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You've said you'll do anything to  sort out what needs to be done.</p><p>Does that include thinking outside the box, maybe bringing in outside  help, using the money you pledged from your election campaign to  federations maybe, to instead go to the fight against doping?  </p><p>Is there anything off limits in -- ?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COE:  The day after I got elected, I started a root and branch review  of the organization.  Clearly in the light of the allegations today and the  criminal allegations made at the beginning of the week, I've advanced that  review.  And I will do anything it takes to create and return our sport to  being a responsible, transparent, accountable sport that is responsive.  </p><p>And that is what I'm pledged to do.  And we have to do this absolutely  on the behalf of the clean athletes.</p><p>THOMAS:  You have been backed by the IOC and Dick Pound as the right  man for the IAAF to lead in going forward.  You faced the Olympic finals in  1980 and 1984.  You put on a terrific London Olympic Games, Seb Coe.</p><p>Is this the toughest challenge of your career?  </p><p>COE:  I will do anything it needs to fix this.</p><p>THOMAS:  Thanks for your time.</p><p>COE:  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIDDELL:  Richard, that was Alex Thomas asking those questions a  couple of hours ago here on CNN.  He actually began that interview by  defending the remarks he had made about the outgoing IAAF president, who  himself has now been implicated in this whole mess.  He's been questioned  by criminal authorities.  </p><p>And Seb Coe, having to begin that interview by saying, you know, when  I was complimentary of him, I didn't have the full facts at my disposal.</p><p>QUEST:  Don Riddell, who is in the CNN Center, Don, just stay there,  I'm looking at Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow.  </p><p>Matthew, I want you to hear Don's answer to my question.  </p><p>Don, is it likely that Russia would be banned from the next Olympic  Games?  </p><p>RIDDELL:  Well, we'll have to wait and see how things play out.  I  mean, that, I think, is the nuclear option that remains on the table for  the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency.  </p><p>What they're saying is that if Russia plays ball, if they effectively  'fess up to what they've gone -- what has gone on and promise that they can  fix things going forward, then maybe there is a chance that they can be  rehabilitated and brought back into the international forum.  </p><p>If they don't, then I think there is a chance that they could be  banned from the next Olympics.  And when you consider what a --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RIDDELL:  -- superpower globally Russia is, that would be huge.</p><p>QUEST:  Matthew is chomping at the bit because he has got the story  from Russia and how Moscow -- thanks, Don.  </p><p>How is Moscow going to justify?  </p><p>Because this report has chapter and verse against the Russian athletes  and the systemic doping.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I mean,  Richard, I just can't see that the Russians are going to take a step back  and say, look, you know what, hands up, we did it, we're guilty.  </p><p>And in fact every comment we've had so far since this report was  issued a few hours ago has been completely defensive, completely denial --  complete denial that there's anything wrong in Russia.  The head of the  Russian doping agency said this is an unprofessional report and it's  illogical, it doesn't make sense.  </p><p>The Russian sports minister has said that the problem of doping has  been sorted out already in Russia and the labs to test athletes are the  best in the world.  </p><p>This is about much more than sport in Russia.  The country has spent  billions of dollars, billions of dollars promoting this image that it is a  leading sporting superpower.  It had the Winter Olympics in 2014, it had  the swimming championships this year, it's got the World Cup in 2018.   Billions of dollars has been spent.</p><p>It's about promoting Russia's image for the Kremlin.  There's no way,  there's no way, in my opinion, they're going to say, yes, you know what,  we've been cheating all along.</p><p>QUEST:  Matthew Chance in Moscow, Don Riddell at \"WORLD SPORT,\"  gentlemen, we'll follow it closely, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the chief executive,  Sir Tim Clark, Emirates Airline, the largest in the world, he says that  there are many airports, not perhaps just Sharm el-Sheikh, where there are  safety and security concerns.  You'll hear him -- next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>QUEST:  The president of Emirates Airlines says there are many  airports around the world that could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks.   Uncertainty over what brought down a Metrojet plane over a week ago is now  weighing heavily on the airline industry.  Sir Tim Clark of Emirates spoke  to John Defterios, who is attending the Dubai Air Show.</p><p>And Sir Tim told him the company is reviewing its security procedures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIR TIM CLARK, PRESIDENT, EMIRATES AIRLINES:  If you put the incident  in the context of what happened -- and we understand what happened -- we  can get a fix on what happened.  We understand that.  </p><p>And if it was as a result of the alleged device put on the airplane,  then we must assess, both as an airline, Emirates itself, all its security  protocols at all the airports it flies to.  And we are doing that, as it  happens.  We do it on an ongoing basis.  And I would expect the industry  and other carriers that have a global reach such as ours would do the same.   And I'm sure they will do.</p><p>In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization and other  regulators within their own countries are probably going to come along and  say, look, we need to see what you're doing, we need to talk to the airport  authorities.  We need to talk to the stakeholders on the airports with  regard to who does security, how they do it, how they screen employees,  what processes are going on.</p><p>All this will happen, in my view, as a result of what happened at  Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  I've flown into Sharm  el-Sheikh a number of different times for conferences and also on holiday.   It's a soft target.  I mean, the reality is, if you're a terrorist  organization and you want to infiltrate an airport, the smaller tourist  destinations seem to be vulnerable.  </p><p>This is a reality, is it not?  </p><p>CLARK:  Yes, look, unfortunately for the Egyptians, this airport was,  in the view, I believe, of the Egyptian government, was a secure airport,  because they knew there was a clear and present threat.  So they had  security in the place.  Maybe it was slightly lax in certain areas.  I  don't want to criticize them.  </p><p>But as you rightly say, there are many airports in the world, and not  just in Egypt or Africa, all over the place.  There are potential targets  that -- airports that are vulnerable.  And those are the ones that must  look at their procedures to ensure that kind of thing can't happen.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Aren't you very concerned that maybe staff was compromised  here and they're cooperating with the very seedy elements that got into the  airport?  </p><p>CLARK:  I made mention of the human resource.  It is the human  resource that applies the processes, the procedures, the protocols.  If you  have a weak human resource, then there are going to be issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Sir Tim Clark of Emirates talking to John Defterios.</p><p>Safety protocols at Sharm el-Sheikh airport are now under intense  scrutiny.  CNN's Erin McLaughlin now reports on the allegations of security  breaches.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>ERIC MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Wheels down at Sharm  el-Sheikh International Airport, the latest point in a wave of evacuations  ordered by British and Russian governments to bring their citizens safely  home, this as questions swirl around the airport's security.  </p><p>Allegations key scanners are sometimes not functioning and employees  accept bribes, allegations the Egyptians deny.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  For now, this is as close as our cameras can get to the  airport, after the military took over and kicked the media out.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over):  But it wasn't always this way.  Six days  after the plane crash, Egyptian officials were eager to show us around.   They took us on a tour to see the airport's inner workings.  They showed us  the luggage screening process, a process the British government says may  have been manipulated, leading to the possible bombing of Metrojet Flight  9268.  </p><p>BBC reports British intelligence believed a bomb was placed in the  lower half of the plane's fuselage, the place where luggage is stored  during the flight.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  All bags are first X-rayed and if they see something they  think is suspicious, that's when they send it to this machine for more  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over):  It's called a CTX machine, and it's used to  test for explosives.  When we were there, everything seemed to run  smoothly.  But the Associated Press reports that's not always the case.  </p><p>An unnamed airport official says the machine often breaks down and the  breakdowns have more to do with, quote,  \"human stupidity\" rather than  technical faults.  </p><p>Another official told AP the police men at the scanning machines are  poorly paid and sometimes take bribes to allow drugs and weapons through.  </p><p>One police man told CNN, unlike other airport employees, he and his  colleagues are not searched before entering the airport; instead, they're  vetted and managed by Egypt's top security agencies.  He said their work is  watched through the airport's camera system.  </p><p>We were shown one of the rooms used to monitor that system.  We're  told they have footage of Flight 9268.  They say it's part of the ongoing  investigation.  </p><p>During our tour, we weren't allowed to see everything we wanted.   Didn't say why.  We asked to get on the tarmac.  This was as close as we  were allowed to go.  We filmed through an open door and we were denied  access to the main room used to monitor the airport.  </p><p>Egyptian authorities are hitting back at allegations of security  lapses.  The civil aviation ministry spokesman told CNN, \"I am not saying  we are 100 percent mistake free.  It is possible but not in the way it was  portrayed.  These allegations are generalizations.  They are baseless and  false.\"  </p><p>They insist the airport is safe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  International civil aviation authority and we are  complying with all the standard and regulations of this authority which  means it's completely safe to fly and fly from and to Sharm el-Sheikh  airport.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over):  The British and Russian officials are  skeptical.  They've sent their own teams to evaluate the airport and  shepherd their citizens home.  Whether or not ISIS brought down Metrojet  9268, security at this and other airports in the region will remain under  scrutiny -- Erin McLaughlin, CNN, Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, the rate hike fears are up.  The  markets are down.  U.S. stocks fell from the open and they never recovered.   They were off the worst of the day but still I think the word is ugly for  how the day progressed.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>QUEST:  So the market started lower and it remained unhappy for the  session.  A last-minute surge wasn't enough.  The stocks began falling  right from the beginning and frankly never really recovered.  It was off  200 points at one stage.  </p><p>Is it only the prospect of higher interest rates from the Fed which is  starting towards, in the words of Janet Yellen, as a live possibility for  December?  </p><p>Paul La Monica is with me.</p><p>When you get a day like today, Paul, down at the beginning, start of a  new week, down at the beginning, never really looks back, what's going on?  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  The Fed rate hike  concerns are part of it.  But I think what's more worrisome was you had  some pretty poor economic data coming from China, exports and imports both  down.  And remember, it was China that really sparked all that market  volatility this summer.  </p><p>I think it has more to do with that than whether or not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  -- it's all percent, I'm sorry, but it's -- there's a grunt  feeling about that.  The market was down and it never recovered.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes.  You never like to see a day like this.  But we had a  solid week last week.  We've had an amazing few weeks now, a huge run-up in  October.  So I don't think you need to be too concerned about one day like  this within the context of that big rally we've had from the lows of  August.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's look at the European markets.  European stocks also  closed the week lower.  You could see the FTSE was down, very sharp losses  in Frankfurt with the DAX.  </p><p>In the French market, Renault was down 3.5 percent after the  government said it opposes a merger with Nissan.  And Intercontinental down  5 percent as it says it's not considering a sale or a merger.  So European  markets are still -- they are particularly unhappy at the moment.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, obviously the European markets are even more  concerned, I think, about China than the U.S.  It's a huge trading partner  of China.  But the DAX in Germany has actually done even better than the  S&amp;P 500 and a lot of U.S. stocks.  So it doesn't shock me that Chinese weak  data would send European stocks even further down than we had in the U.S.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  See you tomorrow.</p><p>Now when it comes to the telecommunications companies, these two, one  of them brings you the Internet on your phone and at home and now they're  doing it together.</p><p>It's Cisco, which is the world's top router company, depending on how  you like to pronounce that word, and Ericsson of Sweden is the world's  biggest wireless equipment maker.  </p><p>Take Ericsson and Cisco, and you put them together, not in a merger,  the two of them plan to build networks and collaborate on development, a  partnership, a strategic arrangement, not a merger.  </p><p>The chief execs of both companies join me.  And Cisco's chief exec,  Chuck Robbins, told me what his customers will get out of this deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CEO, CISCO:  It really is the combination of Ericsson  that is just a market leader and the areas that they play and in Cisco, in  the market areas that we play.  And we believe in coming together we can  help the service providers, first in our first phase, the service providers  really transform their networks and move to this next generation of  architecture that allows them to deliver services more quickly to their  customers, actually allows them to drive their own growth in addition to  what we see between Ericsson and Cisco.  </p><p>And then we also see an opportunity to really create a seamless mobile  experience in the enterprise and also work together on really unleashing  the value of IOT --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>ROBBINS:  -- for our customers in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Hans, most consumers -- I'm not being disrespectful here --  but they won't really care about Cisco and Ericsson; they just care that  the whole thing works, don't they?  </p><p>HANS VESTBERG, CEO, ERICSSON:  Yes, they do.  And that's what this is  all about.  What Cisco and Ericsson will do, they will see that the video  stream, the data streams that consumers are using all around the world will  come much more effectively to the screens.  If it's a small screen or a  large screen, that's what we're doing together with the service providers  all around the world.  </p><p>So they should care that we're coming together, because we should give  their experience to be much better.</p><p>QUEST:  So Hans, why not just do it very simply and do a merger?  </p><p>Strategic partnerships are all fine and good.</p><p>But if it's really broad-based and deep-delving into the  infrastructure of each company, aren't you better off just merging?  </p><p>VESTBERG:  I think that we have both our options, what we wanted to  do.  (INAUDIBLE) companies or we could actually double down on I.P., which  scenario, which we're all in the fringes in our strategy (ph).  </p><p>But to be honest, this is the most agile way of working in the new  world, where you need to find partners in the areas where you're not  equally good.  </p><p>I think this is actually the next generation where you'll do strategic  partnerships instead of doing big, bulky mergers.  And I've said it before,  I'm not a big believer in big tech mergers; it's very complicated, have  different platforms.  </p><p>Here we actually are finding the best way for us to continuing  investing in areas where we are number one, Cisco in theirs, they are  number one.  And together we want to a bridge in between us in order to get  the consumer experience and the customer experience that is far more  better.</p><p>QUEST:  One of the hottest issues at the moment is that of national  security and the number of governments that are seeking the ability and the  right to either eavesdrop or to get hold of information.</p><p>ROBBINS:  We have never provided any special access to our equipment  nor will we do so.  And I think it's important on two fronts, number one,  to work with each government to understand the data privacy requirements  and concerns and then work to architect the networks in a way that actually  accommodates that.  </p><p>And I think that's one of the benefits of what we can do with  Ericsson.  </p><p>And the last thing is that security is so important for our customers.   And we believe that the combination of Hans' technology, our technology  coming together, from the mobile device all the way through the  infrastructure, we believe that we can help our customers not only deal  with data privacy and the issues that they would like to deal with but also  just provide a much greater degree of security across the board.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Two chief execs, Ericsson and Cisco, talking to me earlier.</p><p>A massive fine for Africa's largest mobile operator first obliterated  the company's stock price and now it has cost the chief executive his job.

Now, the firm has been hit with a massive fine in  Nigeria for failing to cut off unregistered SIM cards.</p><p>Nigeria says that by having those unregistered SIM cards, millions of  anonymous customers creating a risk that terrorists and criminals can  communicate and plot with immunity.  </p><p>As MTN tries to negotiate a lower penalty, Sifiso Dabengwa said he was  resigning as CEO in the interest of the companies and its shareholders.  </p><p>Now, look at what's happening -- a $5.2 billion fine.  That's roughly  half of MTN's annual revenues.  The firm is huge, it has some 60 million  subscribers in Nigeria, each paying roughly $86 per subscriber - gives you  an idea.</p><p>So and of course it is pancontinent, MTN, in many different countries.  </p><p>[16:35:03] But look at how the share price has fallen recently since  October.  At that very sharp fall, that's when the fine is announced, it  becomes clear, but it's down some 15 percent over the last year.</p><p>Eleni Giokos joins us now from Johannesburg to put this into  perspective.  The fine is huge but why has the chief executive gone?  </p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well this is the interesting  question.  We all thought that Sifiso Dabengwa was going to see this  through and that he was going to be the man that would try and negotiate a  better deal.</p><p>I mean, how do you negotiate $5.2 billion?  But that's what the market  was expecting.  The reality is, Richard, that MTN failed to announce - make  the announcement - to when they found out about the $5.2 billion penalty.</p><p>So the Nigerian regulators had announced very early on a Monday  morning 26th of October and then failed to announce it before the market  opened in Johannesburg.</p><p>And in fact only did this when the market already had shown that it  was working against MTN share price.  MTN share price had really plunged by  6 percent and then 2:30 in the afternoon we saw MTN's cautionary  announcement coming through.</p><p>So there's a massive gray area.  Why didn't MTN shareholders know  about this sign (ph) in time so that they could act responsibly?</p><p>Over and above that we saw MTN share price also coming under pressure,  losing about 25 percent of 1 point over the last couple of weeks and then  the Johannesburg Stock Exchange decided to suspend the company for a few  hours of trade last week.</p><p>So all of these things working against Sifiso Dabengwa at this time.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, now - the fine itself -- $5.2 billion is, I mean, in  South Africa and in Africa and in Nigeria, are people saying this is a fine  that's commensurate with what they did or out of all proportion to what  they did?</p><p>GIOKOS:  Well I think we have to look at the fine per user, and it  basically comes down to around $1,000 per user because we're talking about  over 5 million subscribers.</p><p>So is $1,000 per user a fine that is justified for a terrorist  potentially using an unregistered SIM card?  Some are arguing yes it is.   Some are saying that it's just not in proportion.  And we're talking about  $5.2 billion which basically equates to over 22 percent of Nigeria's entire  2014 budget.</p><p>So we're talking about a really big fine.  The Nigerian Communications  Commission has also been working very closely with the telecoms companies  since 2008 trying to get unregistered users either disconnected or making  sure that they're in the system somehow so they can be traced.</p><p>So deadlines have been coming through since 2013, but unregistered SIM  cards have been slipping through the system.  And, Richard, it's not only  unregistered SIM cards.  MTN and other big operators - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>GIOKOS:  -- in the country have been selling pre-registered SIM cards.   So in other words, people were buying SIM cards that were registered  already for a premium.</p><p>QUEST:  Ultimately does this jeopardize MTN - the future of the  company?  Because it is a large company.  Nigeria is merely one country  albeit the largest where it operates.  So is the survival of MTN in any way  put at risk by this fine?  </p><p>GIOKOS:  Well, I mean in terms of survival, many of the analysts say  MTN is going to survive this but liquidity is going to be an issue.   Payment terms are going to come and, you know, under the spotlight as well.</p><p>How much are they going to pay?  Is it going to be halved?  Is it  going to come down to around $ 1 billion which some people are expecting?  </p><p>And remember, Richard, actually in 2008/2009, we had Bharti Airtel  snooping around wanting to acquire MTN and look for a potential deal.</p><p>So is this a good time for other potential suitors to come along?  MTN  has 233 million subscribers across the continent.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Welcome onboard and hope to have you many  more times with us - </p><p>GIOKOS:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  -- on \"Quest Means Business.\"  Our new South Africa - or  Southern Africa - business correspondent Eleni joining us from  Johannesburg.</p><p>It's anything but business as usual.

The upshotter (ph) promised to hold  more talks, this time with other producers including China.  The position  is pretty dreadful.</p><p>The U.K. steel companies are accusing China of dumping their product  on the European market and driving local manufacturers out of business.  </p><p>They were calling for stronger action from the E.U. to defend jobs and  not just a promise of further talks.  </p><p>I asked the European Commission Vice President what the E.U. could do  when people are calling for action.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  There are  already now, if I remember right, 37 cases in which E.U. has taken action.   If there is state subsidy case or anti-dumping investigations going on, it  will take a few months and then we decide whether this is the case or not.</p><p>So we have trade defense instruments at our disposal and we are  actively using them.</p><p>QUEST:  I can hear industry saying - and I'm sure you hear it, I'm  sure they say it in fairly blunt terms to your face - but I can hear them  saying it's not enough, they need more from you.</p><p>KATAINEN:  Well actually we cannot launch sanctions to anybody without  complaints and every time when industries are doing official complaining,  the Commission start investigating the issues or the case.</p><p>And this is - this - there is something what has happened so far and  this will continue also in the future.  But actually what we need is the  solution to overcapacity problem.  </p><p>Because always it's not the question of dumping or subsidy but the  over-capacity starts creates difficulties and problems to the market.  </p><p>So I just visited Beijing at the end of September and we had very  fruitful discussion with Chinese authorities that E.U. and China will start  developing negotiation formats for reducing overcapacity.</p><p>So we need international multilateral but also bilateral tools to - in  order to - reduce over production.  One significant issue which may have  impacted the overcapacity issue is the climate negotiations which takes  place in Paris at the end of this month.</p><p>And there I guess the leaders will agree to reduce overcapacity  issues.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:45:03] QUEST:  That's Jyrki Katainen, the European Commissioner  talking to me earlier.</p><p>The World Health Organization has declared Sierra Leone free from  Ebola.  The country has not had a case of Ebola in more than 42 days.   That's two incubation cycles of the virus.  </p><p>The disease has killed more than 3,500 people in Sierra Leone.  The  World Bank estimates the epidemic wiped out 3 percent of GDP in 2014.  </p><p>Sierra Rutile operates mines in the southwest of country.  John Sisay  is the chief executive.  Good evening, sir, you join me tonight from  London.</p><p>JOHN SISAY, CEO, SIERRA RUTILE:  Good evening.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we were talking to government officials and the president  of the country, we were talking about a system months ago - it was all  about the way in which the country has to be rebuilt, the difficulty of a  country that was already devastated economically now having to go back to  square one if not further back.</p><p>So from your point of view, what's the priority for rebuilding the  economy?  </p><p>SISAY:  Let's not forget, Richard, that prior to Ebola Sierra Leone  was actually doing fairly well.  The GDP growth was in double digits.  </p><p>So the first thing we have to do is go back to where we were.  Now,  accepted is the challenge given that Sierra Leone economy is a commodity- driven economy, and as we know commodities are very sluggish at the moment.</p><p>But we have to try and go back to that.  And then we also have to try  and look at how we can diversify the economy for the future, focusing on  things like infrastructure, tourism and agriculture.  </p><p>I know that the government tried to preempt some of this in terms of  Ebola recovery by talking to people like the E.U. for an Ebola recovery  fund to focus on infrastructure developments like water and more roads.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but a company like yourself, I mean, you kept trading,  you managed to stay and keep doing business throughout, but you had huge  logistical challenges in terms of getting product in and getting product  out.</p><p>But you did survive - your company survived.  </p><p>SISAY:  Absolutely.  We had some advantages, Richard, because the  first case of Ebola happened away from our area.  So we were able to put  protocols in place, we were able to look at our supply chain and look at,  you know, (AUDIO GAP) time point of view what other supplies we needed in  country and we were able to stock up in advance of the shutdowns that the  country had to go through.</p><p>So it was really a question of running a business planning for an  event for the worst-case scenarios.  We were able to do that, we were able  to mount serious awareness campaign around our area.  </p><p>Luckily our communities understood the seriousness of the disease and  adhered to the protocol that we put in place.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you feel that the right policies are in place now to sort  of take advantage?  Because obviously, you know, commodities are down,  China is buying less, countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and the likes  are commodity driven are going to suffer as a result.  </p><p>And so I'm wondering is this a double hit for you? </p><p>SISAY:  It was a double hit.  But like I mentioned earlier, even more  important now to look at how the economy would diversify going forward.  So  that, you know, we would not suffer so much from these shocks in the global  cycle.  </p><p>Like I mentioned, for example, an area that requires more investment  which shows huge potential is agriculture, - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>SISAY:  -- another area is tourism.  And I don't know if you know,  Richard, but Sierra Leone has the deepest natural hot port in Africa.  So  we have an advantage there to develop a real transshipment port that can be  a gateway to West Africa.</p><p>So there are plenty other opportunities - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>SISAY:  -- away from mining and commodities that I think the  government will be focusing on as we go forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  John, thank you for joining us this evening.  Much appreciate  you coming in and talking to us.  Very much appreciate it.</p><p>SISAY:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And as we finish our discussion, now just to make it clear  because obviously thousands of people died and in no way does a discussion  on economics in any sense lessen the seriousness and the gravity of what  took place with Ebola.</p><p>But longer term of course, there is a question of how you rebuild the  economy and then once you're talking about that, then you are looking at  people like John Sisay and how they are going to develop their businesses.</p><p>As we continue tonight on \"Quest Means Business,\" Norwegian chief  executive - that's Norwegian Cruise Line chief executive - he's got a brand  new ship, carries 4,000 passengers.

I instead  tried the fastest and largest aqua park yesterday with my seven-year-old  granddaughter and she gave me the thumbs up.  And if Mariana (ph) liked it,  then I know it's going to be a big hit.</p><p>QUEST:  You're well advanced in your plans, aren't you?  I remember  asking you about the plans in the bottom of your drawer.  </p><p>It seems to me like you've found the key to the bottom of your drawer  or the bottom drawer, you've opened it up and Escape is part of a plan for  Cuba.</p><p>DEL RIO:  Well, someday Escape will go to Cuba.  I think once we  receive Cuban government clearance, I'm confident that there's huge pent up  demand from the American public to go to Cuba.</p><p>It's been over 50 years.  The cruise industry didn't even really exist  the last time Cuba was open to American visitors.  </p><p>So I think it's going to be a wonderful experience.</p><p>QUEST:  These 4,000, 3 to 4 to 5,000 passenger vessels, I'm not being  disrespectful when I say this though that they've commoditized the cruise  industry.  It is passengers on a truly industrial scale, isn't it?</p><p>[16:55:15] DEL RIO:  Well, we're trying to break that mold, but I know  what you mean.  And one of the things that we do differently than the rest  of the cruise industry is, you know, we market to fill the vessels.  We  don't want to discount price.</p><p>So we've changed the conversation with the consumer from that of low  prices to that of high value.  And in doing so, we're able to offer the  consumer - I wish you could be here to see this ship, Richard.  She is not  a mainstream-looking vessel.</p><p>If you take venue to venue and you compare what we have here onboard  Escape to what we have on some of our more upscale lines like Oceania and  Regent, she stacks up very well.  </p><p>This is not your grandfather's cruise line.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  It may not be your grandfather's, what about your mother's?   \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\"  On this show, you heard Sir  Tim Clark of Emirates saying that there are many airports in the world  where there could be security and safety issues.</p><p>That's an extremely disturbing thought.  But it really raises the  question - whose responsibility is it to sort it out?  Perhaps only once  the airlines say they won't fly there will anything get done.  </p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in  New York.

It says Russia must be banned from international athletics. We have full coverage.</p><p>The president of the world's largest airline tells CNN there are many airports where security is weak.</p><p>And MTN's chief executive resigns on accusations it didn't do enough to prevent terrorists using its network.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest. We start a new week together. And I mean business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening. Tonight: it's a deeply rooted culture of cheating at all levels. Those are the words from the World Athletic Corporation, which faces a corruption scandal that threatens to overshadow the one at FIFA in terms of seriousness and scale.</p><p>The world's antidoping agency says it's uncovered what amounts to, in their words, \"state-sponsored doping\" in Russia. And it has called for Russia to be suspended from the 2016 Olympics.</p><p>It is an extraordinary story tonight. It says that the -- Russia should be -- faces a ban, that the 2012 Olympics sabotaged by failure to crack down on doping cheat -- that was the London Olympics in 2012 -- and it says there is evidence of corruption and bribery, which has now been sent to Interpol.</p><p>So Russia facing a ban; London Olympics sabotaged; Interpol is now investigating.</p><p>Dick Pound, who led the investigation, has called the findings \"very damaging.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK POUND, CHAIRMAN, WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY: It is worse than we thought. It has the effect, unlike other forms of corruption, of actually affecting the results on the field of play. And athletes, both in Russia and abroad, are suffering as a result of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joining me now, Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow for us tonight, and \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell, who is at the CNN Center.</p><p>We'll begin with you, Don, if we may.</p><p>I read large parts of the long report today. It is breathtaking in its detail and mind-boggling in its level of corruption and miscreant behavior.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And for all that those, what, 300 pages in all this detail, they're saying that this could well be just the tip of the iceberg. It could be more than Russia, it could be more than athletics. But they were given a very narrow brief with regard to the investigation they could do.</p><p>And what they've come up with incredibly damaging to Russia and for the sport of athletics, for which the stakes just couldn't be any higher, Richard. If you were to ask people, you know, your ordinary man on the street, which sport have athletes who cheat, they would say maybe cycling but probably athletics.</p><p>So this is a problem that goes way back. But if the sport is going to tackle it, it has to be tackled now. And you're talking about in Russia, not just athletes but coaches, trainers, doctors -- the entire institution, it stinks.</p><p>QUEST: Don, as I -- so we have the coaches and the trainers providing the doping, the enhanced performance doping. We have the laboratories falsifying results when they know, in their words, the specimen is dirty and they're falsifying it.</p><p>And we have the state conniving in all of this. But I get the impression that everybody has known this for some time.</p><p>What are people like Seb Coe and International Athletics now saying?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, there's an awful lot of pressure on the IAAF and Seb Coe in particular. He's the new president. He's only been in charge for a few months. People are now asking what he knew. He was the vice president of the IAAF for seven years. Now he's in charge.</p><p>And he's got to try and get this thing sorted out right now. He has said he will stop at nothing to make sure that they get to the bottom of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN COE, IAAF PRESIDENT: Look, I realize I've been criticized for that, those remarks I made within moments of winning a campaign. And it also presupposes --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>COE: -- I had a list of allegations sitting in front of me. I did not.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You've said you'll do anything to sort out what needs to be done.</p><p>Does that include thinking outside the box, maybe bringing in outside help, using the money you pledged from your election campaign to federations maybe, to instead go to the fight against doping?</p><p>Is there anything off limits in -- ?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COE: The day after I got elected, I started a root and branch review of the organization. Clearly in the light of the allegations today and the criminal allegations made at the beginning of the week, I've advanced that review. And I will do anything it takes to create and return our sport to being a responsible, transparent, accountable sport that is responsive.</p><p>And that is what I'm pledged to do. And we have to do this absolutely on the behalf of the clean athletes.</p><p>THOMAS: You have been backed by the IOC and Dick Pound as the right man for the IAAF to lead in going forward. You faced the Olympic finals in 1980 and 1984. You put on a terrific London Olympic Games, Seb Coe.</p><p>Is this the toughest challenge of your career?</p><p>COE: I will do anything it needs to fix this.</p><p>THOMAS: Thanks for your time.</p><p>COE: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIDDELL: Richard, that was Alex Thomas asking those questions a couple of hours ago here on CNN. He actually began that interview by defending the remarks he had made about the outgoing IAAF president, who himself has now been implicated in this whole mess. He's been questioned by criminal authorities.</p><p>And Seb Coe, having to begin that interview by saying, you know, when I was complimentary of him, I didn't have the full facts at my disposal.</p><p>QUEST: Don Riddell, who is in the CNN Center, Don, just stay there, I'm looking at Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow.</p><p>Matthew, I want you to hear Don's answer to my question.</p><p>Don, is it likely that Russia would be banned from the next Olympic Games?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, we'll have to wait and see how things play out. I mean, that, I think, is the nuclear option that remains on the table for the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p><p>What they're saying is that if Russia plays ball, if they effectively 'fess up to what they've gone -- what has gone on and promise that they can fix things going forward, then maybe there is a chance that they can be rehabilitated and brought back into the international forum.</p><p>If they don't, then I think there is a chance that they could be banned from the next Olympics. And when you consider what a --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RIDDELL: -- superpower globally Russia is, that would be huge.</p><p>QUEST: Matthew is chomping at the bit because he has got the story from Russia and how Moscow -- thanks, Don.</p><p>How is Moscow going to justify?</p><p>Because this report has chapter and verse against the Russian athletes and the systemic doping.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, Richard, I just can't see that the Russians are going to take a step back and say, look, you know what, hands up, we did it, we're guilty.</p><p>And in fact every comment we've had so far since this report was issued a few hours ago has been completely defensive, completely denial -- complete denial that there's anything wrong in Russia. The head of the Russian doping agency said this is an unprofessional report and it's illogical, it doesn't make sense.</p><p>The Russian sports minister has said that the problem of doping has been sorted out already in Russia and the labs to test athletes are the best in the world.</p><p>This is about much more than sport in Russia. The country has spent billions of dollars, billions of dollars promoting this image that it is a leading sporting superpower. It had the Winter Olympics in 2014, it had the swimming championships this year, it's got the World Cup in 2018. Billions of dollars has been spent.</p><p>It's about promoting Russia's image for the Kremlin. There's no way, there's no way, in my opinion, they're going to say, yes, you know what, we've been cheating all along.</p><p>QUEST: Matthew Chance in Moscow, Don Riddell at \"WORLD SPORT,\" gentlemen, we'll follow it closely, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, Emirates Airline, the largest in the world, he says that there are many airports, not perhaps just Sharm el-Sheikh, where there are safety and security concerns. You'll hear him -- next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: The president of Emirates Airlines says there are many airports around the world that could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Uncertainty over what brought down a Metrojet plane over a week ago is now weighing heavily on the airline industry. Sir Tim Clark of Emirates spoke to John Defterios, who is attending the Dubai Air Show.</p><p>And Sir Tim told him the company is reviewing its security procedures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIR TIM CLARK, PRESIDENT, EMIRATES AIRLINES: If you put the incident in the context of what happened -- and we understand what happened -- we can get a fix on what happened. We understand that.</p><p>And if it was as a result of the alleged device put on the airplane, then we must assess, both as an airline, Emirates itself, all its security protocols at all the airports it flies to. And we are doing that, as it happens. We do it on an ongoing basis. And I would expect the industry and other carriers that have a global reach such as ours would do the same. And I'm sure they will do.</p><p>In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization and other regulators within their own countries are probably going to come along and say, look, we need to see what you're doing, we need to talk to the airport authorities. We need to talk to the stakeholders on the airports with regard to who does security, how they do it, how they screen employees, what processes are going on.</p><p>All this will happen, in my view, as a result of what happened at Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: I've flown into Sharm el-Sheikh a number of different times for conferences and also on holiday. It's a soft target. I mean, the reality is, if you're a terrorist organization and you want to infiltrate an airport, the smaller tourist destinations seem to be vulnerable.</p><p>This is a reality, is it not?</p><p>CLARK: Yes, look, unfortunately for the Egyptians, this airport was, in the view, I believe, of the Egyptian government, was a secure airport, because they knew there was a clear and present threat. So they had security in the place. Maybe it was slightly lax in certain areas. I don't want to criticize them.</p><p>But as you rightly say, there are many airports in the world, and not just in Egypt or Africa, all over the place. There are potential targets that -- airports that are vulnerable. And those are the ones that must look at their procedures to ensure that kind of thing can't happen.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Aren't you very concerned that maybe staff was compromised here and they're cooperating with the very seedy elements that got into the airport?</p><p>CLARK: I made mention of the human resource. It is the human resource that applies the processes, the procedures, the protocols. If you have a weak human resource, then there are going to be issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Sir Tim Clark of Emirates talking to John Defterios.</p><p>Safety protocols at Sharm el-Sheikh airport are now under intense scrutiny. CNN's Erin McLaughlin now reports on the allegations of security breaches.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>ERIC MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wheels down at Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, the latest point in a wave of evacuations ordered by British and Russian governments to bring their citizens safely home, this as questions swirl around the airport's security.</p><p>Allegations key scanners are sometimes not functioning and employees accept bribes, allegations the Egyptians deny.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: For now, this is as close as our cameras can get to the airport, after the military took over and kicked the media out.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): But it wasn't always this way. Six days after the plane crash, Egyptian officials were eager to show us around. They took us on a tour to see the airport's inner workings. They showed us the luggage screening process, a process the British government says may have been manipulated, leading to the possible bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268.</p><p>BBC reports British intelligence believed a bomb was placed in the lower half of the plane's fuselage, the place where luggage is stored during the flight.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: All bags are first X-rayed and if they see something they think is suspicious, that's when they send it to this machine for more (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): It's called a CTX machine, and it's used to test for explosives. When we were there, everything seemed to run smoothly. But the Associated Press reports that's not always the case.</p><p>An unnamed airport official says the machine often breaks down and the breakdowns have more to do with, quote, \"human stupidity\" rather than technical faults.</p><p>Another official told AP the police men at the scanning machines are poorly paid and sometimes take bribes to allow drugs and weapons through.</p><p>One police man told CNN, unlike other airport employees, he and his colleagues are not searched before entering the airport; instead, they're vetted and managed by Egypt's top security agencies. He said their work is watched through the airport's camera system.</p><p>We were shown one of the rooms used to monitor that system. We're told they have footage of Flight 9268. They say it's part of the ongoing investigation.</p><p>During our tour, we weren't allowed to see everything we wanted. Didn't say why. We asked to get on the tarmac. This was as close as we were allowed to go. We filmed through an open door and we were denied access to the main room used to monitor the airport.</p><p>Egyptian authorities are hitting back at allegations of security lapses. The civil aviation ministry spokesman told CNN, \"I am not saying we are 100 percent mistake free. It is possible but not in the way it was portrayed. These allegations are generalizations. They are baseless and false.\"</p><p>They insist the airport is safe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: International civil aviation authority and we are complying with all the standard and regulations of this authority which means it's completely safe to fly and fly from and to Sharm el-Sheikh airport.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): The British and Russian officials are skeptical. They've sent their own teams to evaluate the airport and shepherd their citizens home. Whether or not ISIS brought down Metrojet 9268, security at this and other airports in the region will remain under scrutiny -- Erin McLaughlin, CNN, Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, the rate hike fears are up. The markets are down. U.S. stocks fell from the open and they never recovered. They were off the worst of the day but still I think the word is ugly for how the day progressed.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: So the market started lower and it remained unhappy for the session. A last-minute surge wasn't enough. The stocks began falling right from the beginning and frankly never really recovered. It was off 200 points at one stage.</p><p>Is it only the prospect of higher interest rates from the Fed which is starting towards, in the words of Janet Yellen, as a live possibility for December?</p><p>Paul La Monica is with me.</p><p>When you get a day like today, Paul, down at the beginning, start of a new week, down at the beginning, never really looks back, what's going on?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: The Fed rate hike concerns are part of it. But I think what's more worrisome was you had some pretty poor economic data coming from China, exports and imports both down. And remember, it was China that really sparked all that market volatility this summer.</p><p>I think it has more to do with that than whether or not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- it's all percent, I'm sorry, but it's -- there's a grunt feeling about that. The market was down and it never recovered.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes. You never like to see a day like this. But we had a solid week last week. We've had an amazing few weeks now, a huge run-up in October. So I don't think you need to be too concerned about one day like this within the context of that big rally we've had from the lows of August.</p><p>QUEST: Let's look at the European markets. European stocks also closed the week lower. You could see the FTSE was down, very sharp losses in Frankfurt with the DAX.</p><p>In the French market, Renault was down 3.5 percent after the government said it opposes a merger with Nissan. And Intercontinental down 5 percent as it says it's not considering a sale or a merger. So European markets are still -- they are particularly unhappy at the moment.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, obviously the European markets are even more concerned, I think, about China than the U.S. It's a huge trading partner of China. But the DAX in Germany has actually done even better than the S&amp;P 500 and a lot of U.S. stocks. So it doesn't shock me that Chinese weak data would send European stocks even further down than we had in the U.S.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. See you tomorrow.</p><p>Now when it comes to the telecommunications companies, these two, one of them brings you the Internet on your phone and at home and now they're doing it together.</p><p>It's Cisco, which is the world's top router company, depending on how you like to pronounce that word, and Ericsson of Sweden is the world's biggest wireless equipment maker.</p><p>Take Ericsson and Cisco, and you put them together, not in a merger, the two of them plan to build networks and collaborate on development, a partnership, a strategic arrangement, not a merger.</p><p>The chief execs of both companies join me. And Cisco's chief exec, Chuck Robbins, told me what his customers will get out of this deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CEO, CISCO: It really is the combination of Ericsson that is just a market leader and the areas that they play and in Cisco, in the market areas that we play. And we believe in coming together we can help the service providers, first in our first phase, the service providers really transform their networks and move to this next generation of architecture that allows them to deliver services more quickly to their customers, actually allows them to drive their own growth in addition to what we see between Ericsson and Cisco.</p><p>And then we also see an opportunity to really create a seamless mobile experience in the enterprise and also work together on really unleashing the value of IOT --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>ROBBINS: -- for our customers in the future.</p><p>QUEST: Hans, most consumers -- I'm not being disrespectful here -- but they won't really care about Cisco and Ericsson; they just care that the whole thing works, don't they?</p><p>HANS VESTBERG, CEO, ERICSSON: Yes, they do. And that's what this is all about. What Cisco and Ericsson will do, they will see that the video stream, the data streams that consumers are using all around the world will come much more effectively to the screens. If it's a small screen or a large screen, that's what we're doing together with the service providers all around the world.</p><p>So they should care that we're coming together, because we should give their experience to be much better.</p><p>QUEST: So Hans, why not just do it very simply and do a merger?</p><p>Strategic partnerships are all fine and good.</p><p>But if it's really broad-based and deep-delving into the infrastructure of each company, aren't you better off just merging?</p><p>VESTBERG: I think that we have both our options, what we wanted to do. (INAUDIBLE) companies or we could actually double down on I.P., which scenario, which we're all in the fringes in our strategy (ph).</p><p>But to be honest, this is the most agile way of working in the new world, where you need to find partners in the areas where you're not equally good.</p><p>I think this is actually the next generation where you'll do strategic partnerships instead of doing big, bulky mergers. And I've said it before, I'm not a big believer in big tech mergers; it's very complicated, have different platforms.</p><p>Here we actually are finding the best way for us to continuing investing in areas where we are number one, Cisco in theirs, they are number one. And together we want to a bridge in between us in order to get the consumer experience and the customer experience that is far more better.</p><p>QUEST: One of the hottest issues at the moment is that of national security and the number of governments that are seeking the ability and the right to either eavesdrop or to get hold of information.</p><p>ROBBINS: We have never provided any special access to our equipment nor will we do so. And I think it's important on two fronts, number one, to work with each government to understand the data privacy requirements and concerns and then work to architect the networks in a way that actually accommodates that.</p><p>And I think that's one of the benefits of what we can do with Ericsson.</p><p>And the last thing is that security is so important for our customers. And we believe that the combination of Hans' technology, our technology coming together, from the mobile device all the way through the infrastructure, we believe that we can help our customers not only deal with data privacy and the issues that they would like to deal with but also just provide a much greater degree of security across the board.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Two chief execs, Ericsson and Cisco, talking to me earlier.</p><p>A massive fine for Africa's largest mobile operator first obliterated the company's stock price and now it has cost the chief executive his job. We'll break down the numbers and we will be in Johannesburg after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:31:25] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment when the chief executive of Norwegian Cruise Lines will be with us and shows me his brand new ship and talks about Cuba and China.</p><p>And Sierra Leone is declared Ebola free. I'll ask the ask the head of a local company where the economy now heads. But before all of that, this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The World Anti-Doping Agency says Russian athletes should be suspended from international athletics after finding evidence of widespread state- sponsored doping.</p><p>Interpol says it will investigate after the WADA report said it found corruption at the highest levels of athletics. The lead investigator said the doping scandal was likely to grow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DICK POUND, P RESIDENT, WADA INDEPENDENT COMMISSION: Tip of the iceberg? I'm afraid you're probably right.</p><p>As I say, we certainly do not think that Russia is the only country with a doping problem and we don't think that athletics is the only sport with a doping problem.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: A veteran democracy campaigner Aung Suu Kyi is on track to win a landslide victory in Myanmar. It's the country's first openly-contested election after decades of military rule.</p><p>Suu Kyi's party claimed almost 90 percent of the seats that is announced so far.</p><p>A Jordanian man has shot and killed people at a police training center in Amman.

Security forces killed the gunman.</p><p>A U.S. official says the attacker was a police officer who had recently been fired.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. It was Mr. Netanyahu's first visit in more than a year and the first time the men had met since Washington agreed a nuclear deal with Iran.</p><p>The President reiterated his support for Israel in the light of recent violence between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'd like to be very clear that we condemn in the strongest terms Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens and I want to repeat once again it is my strong belief that Israeli has not just the right but the obligation to protect itself.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The chief executive of Africa's biggest mobile phone operator MTN has resigned. Now, the firm has been hit with a massive fine in Nigeria for failing to cut off unregistered SIM cards.</p><p>Nigeria says that by having those unregistered SIM cards, millions of anonymous customers creating a risk that terrorists and criminals can communicate and plot with immunity.</p><p>As MTN tries to negotiate a lower penalty, Sifiso Dabengwa said he was resigning as CEO in the interest of the companies and its shareholders.</p><p>Now, look at what's happening -- a $5.2 billion fine. That's roughly half of MTN's annual revenues. The firm is huge, it has some 60 million subscribers in Nigeria, each paying roughly $86 per subscriber - gives you an idea.</p><p>So and of course it is pancontinent, MTN, in many different countries.</p><p>[16:35:03] But look at how the share price has fallen recently since October. At that very sharp fall, that's when the fine is announced, it becomes clear, but it's down some 15 percent over the last year.</p><p>Eleni Giokos joins us now from Johannesburg to put this into perspective. The fine is huge but why has the chief executive gone?</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well this is the interesting question. We all thought that Sifiso Dabengwa was going to see this through and that he was going to be the man that would try and negotiate a better deal.</p><p>I mean, how do you negotiate $5.2 billion? But that's what the market was expecting. The reality is, Richard, that MTN failed to announce - make the announcement - to when they found out about the $5.2 billion penalty.</p><p>So the Nigerian regulators had announced very early on a Monday morning 26th of October and then failed to announce it before the market opened in Johannesburg.</p><p>And in fact only did this when the market already had shown that it was working against MTN share price. MTN share price had really plunged by 6 percent and then 2:30 in the afternoon we saw MTN's cautionary announcement coming through.</p><p>So there's a massive gray area. Why didn't MTN shareholders know about this sign (ph) in time so that they could act responsibly?</p><p>Over and above that we saw MTN share price also coming under pressure, losing about 25 percent of 1 point over the last couple of weeks and then the Johannesburg Stock Exchange decided to suspend the company for a few hours of trade last week.</p><p>So all of these things working against Sifiso Dabengwa at this time.</p><p>QUEST: Right, now - the fine itself -- $5.2 billion is, I mean, in South Africa and in Africa and in Nigeria, are people saying this is a fine that's commensurate with what they did or out of all proportion to what they did?</p><p>GIOKOS: Well I think we have to look at the fine per user, and it basically comes down to around $1,000 per user because we're talking about over 5 million subscribers.</p><p>So is $1,000 per user a fine that is justified for a terrorist potentially using an unregistered SIM card? Some are arguing yes it is. Some are saying that it's just not in proportion. And we're talking about $5.2 billion which basically equates to over 22 percent of Nigeria's entire 2014 budget.</p><p>So we're talking about a really big fine. The Nigerian Communications Commission has also been working very closely with the telecoms companies since 2008 trying to get unregistered users either disconnected or making sure that they're in the system somehow so they can be traced.</p><p>So deadlines have been coming through since 2013, but unregistered SIM cards have been slipping through the system. And, Richard, it's not only unregistered SIM cards. MTN and other big operators -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>GIOKOS: -- in the country have been selling pre-registered SIM cards. So in other words, people were buying SIM cards that were registered already for a premium.</p><p>QUEST: Ultimately does this jeopardize MTN - the future of the company? Because it is a large company. Nigeria is merely one country albeit the largest where it operates. So is the survival of MTN in any way put at risk by this fine?</p><p>GIOKOS: Well, I mean in terms of survival, many of the analysts say MTN is going to survive this but liquidity is going to be an issue. Payment terms are going to come and, you know, under the spotlight as well.</p><p>How much are they going to pay? Is it going to be halved? Is it going to come down to around $ 1 billion which some people are expecting?</p><p>And remember, Richard, actually in 2008/2009, we had Bharti Airtel snooping around wanting to acquire MTN and look for a potential deal.</p><p>So is this a good time for other potential suitors to come along? MTN has 233 million subscribers across the continent.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Welcome onboard and hope to have you many more times with us -</p><p>GIOKOS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: -- on \"Quest Means Business.\" Our new South Africa - or Southern Africa - business correspondent Eleni joining us from Johannesburg.</p><p>It's anything but business as usual. The chief executive of a mining company in Sierra Leone tells us how his organization got through the devastating Ebola epidemic.</p><p>It's \"Quest Means Business,\" the start of a new week.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:42:21] QUEST: E.U. industry ministers met earlier to discuss a sector in crisis - steel of course. The upshotter (ph) promised to hold more talks, this time with other producers including China. The position is pretty dreadful.</p><p>The U.K. steel companies are accusing China of dumping their product on the European market and driving local manufacturers out of business.</p><p>They were calling for stronger action from the E.U. to defend jobs and not just a promise of further talks.</p><p>I asked the European Commission Vice President what the E.U. could do when people are calling for action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: There are already now, if I remember right, 37 cases in which E.U. has taken action. If there is state subsidy case or anti-dumping investigations going on, it will take a few months and then we decide whether this is the case or not.</p><p>So we have trade defense instruments at our disposal and we are actively using them.</p><p>QUEST: I can hear industry saying - and I'm sure you hear it, I'm sure they say it in fairly blunt terms to your face - but I can hear them saying it's not enough, they need more from you.</p><p>KATAINEN: Well actually we cannot launch sanctions to anybody without complaints and every time when industries are doing official complaining, the Commission start investigating the issues or the case.</p><p>And this is - this - there is something what has happened so far and this will continue also in the future. But actually what we need is the solution to overcapacity problem.</p><p>Because always it's not the question of dumping or subsidy but the over-capacity starts creates difficulties and problems to the market.</p><p>So I just visited Beijing at the end of September and we had very fruitful discussion with Chinese authorities that E.U. and China will start developing negotiation formats for reducing overcapacity.</p><p>So we need international multilateral but also bilateral tools to - in order to - reduce over production. One significant issue which may have impacted the overcapacity issue is the climate negotiations which takes place in Paris at the end of this month.</p><p>And there I guess the leaders will agree to reduce overcapacity issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:45:03] QUEST: That's Jyrki Katainen, the European Commissioner talking to me earlier.</p><p>The World Health Organization has declared Sierra Leone free from Ebola. The country has not had a case of Ebola in more than 42 days. That's two incubation cycles of the virus.</p><p>The disease has killed more than 3,500 people in Sierra Leone. The World Bank estimates the epidemic wiped out 3 percent of GDP in 2014.</p><p>Sierra Rutile operates mines in the southwest of country. John Sisay is the chief executive. Good evening, sir, you join me tonight from London.</p><p>JOHN SISAY, CEO, SIERRA RUTILE: Good evening.</p><p>QUEST: When we were talking to government officials and the president of the country, we were talking about a system months ago - it was all about the way in which the country has to be rebuilt, the difficulty of a country that was already devastated economically now having to go back to square one if not further back.</p><p>So from your point of view, what's the priority for rebuilding the economy?</p><p>SISAY: Let's not forget, Richard, that prior to Ebola Sierra Leone was actually doing fairly well. The GDP growth was in double digits.</p><p>So the first thing we have to do is go back to where we were. Now, accepted is the challenge given that Sierra Leone economy is a commodity- driven economy, and as we know commodities are very sluggish at the moment.</p><p>But we have to try and go back to that. And then we also have to try and look at how we can diversify the economy for the future, focusing on things like infrastructure, tourism and agriculture.</p><p>I know that the government tried to preempt some of this in terms of Ebola recovery by talking to people like the E.U. for an Ebola recovery fund to focus on infrastructure developments like water and more roads.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but a company like yourself, I mean, you kept trading, you managed to stay and keep doing business throughout, but you had huge logistical challenges in terms of getting product in and getting product out.</p><p>But you did survive - your company survived.</p><p>SISAY: Absolutely. We had some advantages, Richard, because the first case of Ebola happened away from our area. So we were able to put protocols in place, we were able to look at our supply chain and look at, you know, (AUDIO GAP) time point of view what other supplies we needed in country and we were able to stock up in advance of the shutdowns that the country had to go through.</p><p>So it was really a question of running a business planning for an event for the worst-case scenarios. We were able to do that, we were able to mount serious awareness campaign around our area.</p><p>Luckily our communities understood the seriousness of the disease and adhered to the protocol that we put in place.</p><p>QUEST: Do you feel that the right policies are in place now to sort of take advantage? Because obviously, you know, commodities are down, China is buying less, countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and the likes are commodity driven are going to suffer as a result.</p><p>And so I'm wondering is this a double hit for you?</p><p>SISAY: It was a double hit. But like I mentioned earlier, even more important now to look at how the economy would diversify going forward. So that, you know, we would not suffer so much from these shocks in the global cycle.</p><p>Like I mentioned, for example, an area that requires more investment which shows huge potential is agriculture, -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SISAY: -- another area is tourism. And I don't know if you know, Richard, but Sierra Leone has the deepest natural hot port in Africa. So we have an advantage there to develop a real transshipment port that can be a gateway to West Africa.</p><p>So there are plenty other opportunities -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SISAY: -- away from mining and commodities that I think the government will be focusing on as we go forward.</p><p>QUEST: John, thank you for joining us this evening. Much appreciate you coming in and talking to us. Very much appreciate it.</p><p>SISAY: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And as we finish our discussion, now just to make it clear because obviously thousands of people died and in no way does a discussion on economics in any sense lessen the seriousness and the gravity of what took place with Ebola.</p><p>But longer term of course, there is a question of how you rebuild the economy and then once you're talking about that, then you are looking at people like John Sisay and how they are going to develop their businesses.</p><p>As we continue tonight on \"Quest Means Business,\" Norwegian chief executive - that's Norwegian Cruise Line chief executive - he's got a brand new ship, carries 4,000 passengers. Where is he going to put it and what sort of passengers are going to go on it?</p><p>We'll talk about that after you've had a moment to relax, enjoy and think about \"Make, Create, Innovate.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(SOUND OF SHIP'S FOG HORN)</p><p>[16:52:34] QUEST: Ooh, I'm feeling a bit sea sick to start with. Haven't got me sea legs. It's a \"Vacation Machine.\" That's how the chief of Norwegian Cruise Line is describing his newest vessel and that is it.</p><p>It's called the \"Norwegian Escape,\" and while it was christened on Monday in Miami, the chief executive Frank Del Rio has his set - sights - some 200 miles further south. He told me that one day he hopes to see \"Escape\" dock in Cuba.</p><p>Del Rio is of course a native Cuban himself. I spoke to Frank Del Rio onboard the Escape - well he was on the Escape, I was here in New York -- and I asked Frank how the new liner fits into the Norwegian portfolio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>FRANK DEL RIO, COE, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES: This is by far our largest vessel - 4,200 passengers, 165,000 tons and she's loaded with all the features you'd ever want to go on vacation with, Richard.</p><p>Truly a - literally a - vacation machine.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And as I was reading about it, I think it's the zip lines and the walking around over the sea - I think that's the bit that sort of terrifies me and excites me at the same time.</p><p>Have you tried them yet?</p><p>DEL RIO: I have not, but -</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>DEL RIO: -- Andy Stuart our president has and he loved it. I instead tried the fastest and largest aqua park yesterday with my seven-year-old granddaughter and she gave me the thumbs up. And if Mariana (ph) liked it, then I know it's going to be a big hit.</p><p>QUEST: You're well advanced in your plans, aren't you? I remember asking you about the plans in the bottom of your drawer.</p><p>It seems to me like you've found the key to the bottom of your drawer or the bottom drawer, you've opened it up and Escape is part of a plan for Cuba.</p><p>DEL RIO: Well, someday Escape will go to Cuba. I think once we receive Cuban government clearance, I'm confident that there's huge pent up demand from the American public to go to Cuba.</p><p>It's been over 50 years. The cruise industry didn't even really exist the last time Cuba was open to American visitors.</p><p>So I think it's going to be a wonderful experience.</p><p>QUEST: These 4,000, 3 to 4 to 5,000 passenger vessels, I'm not being disrespectful when I say this though that they've commoditized the cruise industry. It is passengers on a truly industrial scale, isn't it?</p><p>[16:55:15] DEL RIO: Well, we're trying to break that mold, but I know what you mean. And one of the things that we do differently than the rest of the cruise industry is, you know, we market to fill the vessels. We don't want to discount price.</p><p>So we've changed the conversation with the consumer from that of low prices to that of high value. And in doing so, we're able to offer the consumer - I wish you could be here to see this ship, Richard. She is not a mainstream-looking vessel.</p><p>If you take venue to venue and you compare what we have here onboard Escape to what we have on some of our more upscale lines like Oceania and Regent, she stacks up very well.</p><p>This is not your grandfather's cruise line.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: It may not be your grandfather's, what about your mother's? \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" On this show, you heard Sir Tim Clark of Emirates saying that there are many airports in the world where there could be security and safety issues.</p><p>That's an extremely disturbing thought. But it really raises the question - whose responsibility is it to sort it out? Perhaps only once the airlines say they won't fly there will anything get done.</p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's profitable.</p><p>Let's get together tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.
