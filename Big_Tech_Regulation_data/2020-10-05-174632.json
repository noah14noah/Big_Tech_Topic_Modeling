Today, four billion people are offline, and 1.6 billion of them live in sparsely populated areas around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, a race to solve that problem has emerged among big tech companies like Google, SpaceX and Facebook. Now, Facebook has published research on an unconventional solution: using light to wirelessly transmit internet signals. The work comes from a Facebook-led initiative called Internet.org, which, according to the initiative's website, has so far brought internet access to more than 25 million people. </p><p>  Most internet signals today are transmitted at high rates through wired optical fiber networks -- which require expensive infrastructure -- or at lower rates through wireless radio frequencies, which are limited in bandwidth, subject to regulations and vulnerable to interception.</p><p>  In a paper published Tuesday in Optica, researchers from Internet.org's Connectivity Lab have outlined a new type of light detector that can be used for free-space optical communication, a communication technique that uses light to send data wirelessly.</p><p>  ''It's a completely new design,'' said Julian Cheng, a communications engineer at the University of British Columbia who was not involved in the study. With a device that's simpler than traditional light receivers, he said, the Facebook team was able to achieve wireless data rates on the order of wired systems.</p><p>  Free-space optical communication works by encoding communication signals in laser beams. Transmitters on the ground or in satellites shoot that light through the air to receivers that can decode the data. (To understand this on simple terms, think of encoding and sending information through morse code using a flashlight.)</p><p>  One longstanding obstacle to free-space optical communication is a trade-off between speed and size. To increase the number of laser signals hitting a receiver, one can increase the size of the receiver. But doing so makes the receiver slower.</p><p>  Instead, many free-space optical communication systems use smaller receivers with complex pointing and tracking systems. Because laser beams are narrow and travel in straight lines from point A to point B, these receivers have to continuously maneuver to catch laser beams head-on.</p><p>  Imagine trying to water a small potted plant with a water gun from different angles, said Alan Willner, an optical communications scientist at the University of Southern California and president of the Optical Society, the professional society that published Internet.org's paper. To maximize the amount of water you catch, you have to constantly move the pot around.</p><p>  The Facebook researchers' solution to this problem is a light detector that doesn't need pointing and tracking, but still allows for fast transmission. To do this, they took advantage of fluorescence, the process of absorbing light and re-emitting it at a lower energy.</p><p>Facebook's detector contains a spherical bundle of special fluorescent fibers. The bundle, somewhere between the size of a golf ball and tennis ball, is able to absorb blue laser light from any direction and re-emit it as green light. Because that green light is diffuse, it can then be funneled to a small receiver that converts the light back to data.</p><p>  In our hypothetical example, imagine that instead of a water gun, you're pointing a blow dart gun at a water balloon attached to a funnel over the potted plant. As soon as you hit the balloon, it pops and releases water. With the addition of the balloon, you've eliminated the need to move the pot around. You can shoot at the water balloon from any direction, and the plant will get watered.</p><p>Facebook's new detector is able to achieve fast data rates of two gigabits per second -- several orders of magnitude higher than those from radio frequencies -- because light has a higher frequency than radio waves, and because the fluorescence process is fast. Free-space optical communication can also carry more information than radio communication, and is more secure because narrow laser beams are harder to intercept than wide radio waves.</p><p>  Because of all these benefits, building on Facebook's proof of concept holds tremendous potential not just for remote areas, but for meeting increased data demand all over the world, said Kamran Kiasaleh, an optical communications scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who was not involved in the study.</p><p>  The technology fits in with Facebook's plans to beam internet access down from the skies using drones. With laser transmitters and arrays of these light detectors, drones could exchange data with one another and with ground stations. Indoors, these detectors could provide high data rates to mobile devices.</p><p>  For now, the new light detector is still in early stages, said Tobias Tiecke, a communication systems scientist at Facebook and a co-author of the new paper. His team built their current device using off-the-shelf materials that are used for harvesting solar light.</p><p>  ''The performance of our system can still be increased much further by developing materials tailored for communication,'' he said.</p><p>  Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the  Science Times newsletter.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-374512160722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K90-YBH1-JBG3-62KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/science/facebook-wireless-light-internet.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/science/facebook-wireless-light-internet.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 22, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001006</classCode><className>LASERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X9G</classCode><className>POPULATION DENSITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000709</classCode><className>FIBER OPTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001006</classCode><className>LASERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000161</classCode><className>BANDWIDTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000447</classCode><className>DATA TRANSMISSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000709</classCode><className>FIBER OPTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Sarah Koenig and her team from the NPR podcast spent more than a year inside the county\u2019s towering criminal justice center to lift up that rock and expose a system rigged to dig holes that that everyday citizens who fall in can never climb out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was staggering to learn about devastated, de-industrialized communities like East Cleveland, where its barely functioning civic government doesn\u2019t keep any records, and criminal suspects deprived of their civil rights can sue all they want because there\u2019s no money to collect. The Serial team exposed cases where people were arrested and simply thrown into a storage closet for days with no charges -- and no toilet. The listener is compelled to ask, how can this even happen? And there\u2019s no easy answer. But one partial answer is more of the sunlight that Serial\u2019s journalism threw onto East Cleveland\u2019s problems.</p><p>Simply put, greater Cleveland needs more journalists, But it\u2019s about to get even fewer of them. Last week, the only daily newspaper in Ohio\u2019s largest city -- the Cleveland Plain-Dealer, published by the Advance Communications chain -- announced its latest batch of layoffs, with 12 more reporters and editors getting a pink slip, This is in addition to another nearly simultaneous move of eliminating 24 copy editors and designers and moving their work to a faceless (and non-unionized, of course) centralized location.</p><p>The villain, according to the announcement, was a familiar one: Declining print advertising revenue. And the cumulative effect of years of job losses at the P-D -- which six years ago reduced home delivery to its print subscribers to three days a week -- have been devastating. (At that time, Terry Egger was president, publisher and chief executive of the P-D. He is currently the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer.) In just a decade, the paper\u2019s union -- the very first News Guild local in America -- went from 340 jobs to only 30. That\u2019s not a typo. That\u2019s one journalist for every 70,000 people in metro Cleveland. And if you\u2019re a corrupt cop or public official in East Cleveland, you can sleep a lot easier tonight, knowing your sordid secrets are safe.</p><p>It may not meet the official definition, but Cleveland is fast becoming a \u201cnews desert,\u201d a term that didn\u2019t even exist 10 years ago. It refers to the growing number of American places -- from rural prairies to Midwestern towns in the shadow of abandoned smokestacks -- that have few or, increasingly, no sources of local journalism. This week, Facebook -- of all corporate people! -- shined its gigantic spotlight on the shrinkage of local news reporting by publishing a map showing where the flow of information has dried up.</p><p>Facebook released a report on how their \"Today\" doesnt work well due to most communities not having access to local news. This is why it is so important to support your local newspaper, radio stations, tv stations, etc. pic.twitter.com/NSoZFFvSn1</p><p>-- Alexandre Fons\u00eaca (@FonsecaAPR) March 19, 2019</p><p>The areas in the lightest shade of green are \u201cnews deserts.\u201d Not surprisingly, rural areas suffer the most -- you could literally drive on a line straight north from the border with Mexico in west Texas all the way to Canada and not pass a vibrant news environment. But why is Facebook bothering to tell us this?</p><p>About a year ago -- in part after stinging criticism that its platform was drowning in literally fake political news that had ultimately swamped the U.S. 2016 presidential election -- Facebook announced a new initiative called Today In. The idea was to give Facebook\u2019s gazillion readers five local news stories every day about their hometown, from trusted mainstream news sources. But the plan faltered in its execution. Team Zuckerberg soon learned a lot of American towns simply aren\u2019t blessed with five reported news stories every day.</p><p>\u201cAbout one in three users in the U.S. live in places where we cannot find enough local news on Facebook to launch Today In.\u201d two Facebook execs wrote in a blog post on Monday. \u201cWhat does that mean exactly? In the last 28 days, there has not been a single day where we\u2019ve been able to find five or more recent news articles directly related to these towns. This does not vary much by region: 35 percent of users in the Midwest, Northeast, and South \u2013 and 26 percent in the West \u2013 live in places where we can\u2019t find much local news on Facebook.\u201d Not all of the areas are ones you\u2019d expect. Facebook had a problem finding local news in parts of New Jersey -- a sad commentary on the way that balkanized state is covered by its news orgs.</p><p>Who killed the local journalism that Facebook wanted to promote? It\u2019s not exactly the whodunnit of the century. The calls are coming from inside Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s big glass house in Menlo Park, California. OK, Facebook may not be the only killer of legacy news orgs, but the crime scene is littered with its DNA.</p><p>Over the last 15 years, as Americans became addicted to the electrons of their laptops and then their mobile phones and ditched the messy ink and day-old headlines of a printed newspaper, Facebook -- offering not just news of the world but news of your actual friends -- sopped up much of that bandwidth. And advertisers know it. The companies that spent most of their 20th Century ad dollars on newspapers when those papers had a monopoly on reaching local consumers are now on Facebook, which attracted 22 percent of all digital advertising dollars last year. The newsrooms that lost those ad dollars are laying off journalists, It\u2019s Econ 101.</p><p>The tragedy is that Facebook is run by smart people who understand this is a bad downward spiral. Many people -- young people entering our allegedly democratic system in particular -- have been increasingly getting most or all of their news from posts on social media, so the implosion of modern journalism will rob Facebook of valuable content. But Facebook is built for quarterly profits, designing algorithms to keep you on its site and to keep sucking out those ad dollars like a vampire squid. The greater civic good will never be programmed in. America is going to see more and more towns like Waynesville, Missouri, which recently lost the Daily Guide newspaper and where one retiree told the Associated Press, \u201ccandidly, for the most part, I\u2019m ignorant.\u201d</p><p>Waynesville, MO has become a statistic. With the shutdown of its newspaper, the Daily Guide, this town in central Missouri\u2019s Ozark hills joined more than 1,400 other cities and towns across the U.S. to lose a newspaper over the past 15 years.<url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/KovMLA5SoE\">https://t.co/KovMLA5SoE</url> pic.twitter.com/jOqVkgr4JX</p><p>-- Phil Meyer (@philmeyer) March 12, 2019</p><p>But wait, everybody: Facebook has a solution to the problem that it helped cause in the first place. The blog post announcing the problems with its 2018 news initiative revealed a new plan for 2019, which includes a $300 million fund to philanthropically support local news initiatives across the United States. That\u2019s great news, but ... isn\u2019t this the giant Catch-22 of 21st Century philanthropy? Millions of dollars meant to deflect your questions about a rigged system that brings in billions of dollars for the status quo.</p><p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- whom, you may have heard, is also running for president -- has a better idea. She\u2019s proposed an innovative plan to end the monopoly power exercised by Facebook and at least two other tech mega-giants, Amazon and Google. Much like the way that government stepped in to save capitalism and reduce unfairness in the 19th Century caused by monopoly-seeking robber barons, Warren wants to regulate the largest tech platforms like other utilities, with laws to prevent anti-competitive mergers (in the case of Facebook, its ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp) and practices that allow these platforms to monopolize product sales and information on their sites, as well as the sale of our private information.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power?--?too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. And the destruction of America\u2019s local news landscape is only part of the trouble with Facebook. As last week\u2019s mass murder in New Zealand powerfully showed, a lack of leadership has allowed Facebook (and other social media) to become platforms less for democratic dialogue and more for spreading hate, with violence that can now be broadcast live to the world in real time. The 2016 election showed how Facebook was manipulated by fake news scammers in Macedonia, Russian spies, and firms like Cambridge Analytica that found it way too easy to abuse our private data.</p><p>For local news, a less powerful Facebook would be only part of the solution. There\u2019s a need for civic-minded (as opposed to self-interested) philanthropy, a public that understands the value of journalism and is willing to pay for it, and for those of us to work in media to constantly do a better job. And Warren\u2019s proposal is just a starting point -- but it\u2019s a conversation that needs to urgently be had, as social media increasingly becomes the artery for spreading the cancers of a new millennium.</p><p>Even as we\u2019re still trying to figure out what the hell hit us in 2016, the 2020 presidential election is here -- and the warning signs are terrible. Already, Russian trolls are said to be developing new strategy to ensure that divisive political content finds its way onto Facebook ahead of the vote. More importantly, Axios reported on Tuesday that President Trump\u2019s campaign has already spent a whopping $3.5 million on Facebook advertising -- double all of the Democratic campaigns combined -- with much more to come.</p><p>Nature abhors a vacuum -- and, apparently, a news desert. Those dry, barren lands are about to be flooded with propaganda.</p><p>___ (c)2019 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20190319-PHI-FACEBOOK-MURDERED-LOCAL-NEWS-NOW-IT-WANTS-TO-SAVE-319-20190319PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP2-X4Y1-JC6P-C1KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Federation of German Consumer Organizations (VZBV), which brought the case, was particularly pleased with the court's decision that Facebook has to comply with German data protection laws, said Carola Elbrecht, VZBV's project manager for consumer rights in the digital world, on Tuesday. <br/>The VZBV was not alone in this. \"The findings of the court are especially interesting because it explicitly affirmed the applicability of the German data protection law on Facebook,\" wrote Thomas Stadler, a German lawyer specializing in IT and intellectual property, in a blog post. <br/>The Higher Court of Berlin's verdict, however, is in direct opposition to a verdict of the Administrative Court of Appeals of the State of Schleswig-Holstein. <br/>That court ruled in April last year that Irish data protection rules and not German data protection law should apply to Facebook. Irish law should apply because Facebook processes German user data at its European headquarters in Ireland, according to the administrative court. Facebook's German subsidiary acts exclusively as a marketing and sales office for the region and doesn't process any personal information, it said. <br/>However, the Higher Court of Berlin disagreed and contended that Facebook's data processing is actually handled in the U.S. by Facebook's parent company and not by its Irish subsidiary, according to the written version of its Jan 24. decision that was released by the VZBV on Monday. It is customary in the German legal system to release written judicial decisions a few weeks after the oral verdict. <br/>If the court had found that the user data was processed by Facebook Ireland and not by Facebook U.S., German data protection law would probably not have been applicable, because Facebook Ireland would have been responsible for handling user data in the E.U., Elbrecht said. </p><p>But because Facebook U.S. is located outside of the E.U., German data protection laws can apply, she added. <br/>Facebook's U.S. parent company collects and processes German user data under the German data protection act when it sets cookies on computers of German users, according to the Higher Court of Berlin. Thus, German data protection law is applicable despite Facebook's Irish office, it added. <br/>\"The verdict is a milestone for data protection in the Facebook era,\" the VZBV said. <br/>The ruling could mean that it might not be worthwhile for big tech companies to settle in countries where the least resistance from data protection authorities can be expected, Elbrecht said, adding that the Irish data protection authority is not very effective. <br/>The VZBV also called on the German government to advocate for a speedy implementation of data protection regulation across the E.U. to guarantee an uniform level of data protection. A uniform regulation was described by German Chancellor Angela Merkel as difficult to achieve during the weekend because some countries have less stringent data protection than Germany. <br/>As the Higher Court of Berlin and Administrative Court of Appeals of the State of Schleswig-Holstein are equals, it is difficult to say which decision will prevail, according to Elbrecht. <br/>The Administrative Court of Appeals' decision is final and cannot be appealed. But Facebook can still formally object to the Higher Court of Berlin ruling within a month, Elbrecht said. <br/>Such an objection could lead to a review of the case by Germany's highest court, the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe, she said, adding that the VZBV expected Facebook to file an objection. <br/>Facebook is still reviewing the decision, a spokeswoman said in an email.\u00a9 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-34272050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LGMTWW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BJC-9871-JDJN-648V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide Provided by Syndigate.info, an Albawaba.com company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Legal Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7141\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 18, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a damning report that singled out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for what it said was a failure of leadership and personal responsibility, the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the companies had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content and disinformation on their platforms.   Companies such as Facebook should not be allowed to behave like   digital gangsters   in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,  the report said. \"The guiding principle of the 'move fast and break things' culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission,\" committee chairman Damian Collins said. </p><p>\"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.\" Collins said the age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. \"The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,\" he said. Facebook became the focus of the committee's 18-month inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network. Zuckerberg apologised last year for a \"breach of trust\" over the scandal. But he refused to appear three times before British lawmakers, a stance that showed \"contempt\" toward parliament and the members of nine legislatures from around the world, the committee said. \"We believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,\" Collins said. \"Mark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world's biggest companies.\" The lawmaker identified major threats to society from the dominance of tech companies such as Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - Google and Twitter. Democracy was at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised adverts from unidentifiable sources, they said, and social media platforms were failing to act against harmful content and respect the privacy of users. Companies like Facebook were also using their size to bully smaller firms that relied on social media platforms to reach customers, it added. - Reuters/ga</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11252384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFN-R8N1-JCDN-11SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><timeReceived>3:27 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> () --  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is letting Facebook off the hook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, the FTC announced a $5 billion fine on Facebook over rampant privacy abuses that violated a 2011 order --- the largest in the agency's history. But even multibillion-dollar fines don't cause tech giants enough pain to stop bad behavior. For Big Tech, fines are a rational cost of doing business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, for example, has handed over more than $9 billion to the European Commission since 2017 for antitrust violations, without skipping a beat. And immediately after reports earlier this month that Facebook would settle with the FTC, the company's stock rose nearly 2%. </p><p>Instead of fines, changing destructive business models and anticompetitive practices is the only way to lessen the platforms' harms. These fixes fall into four main buckets, spelling out the acronym PAIN: privacy, antitrust, interoperability and non-discrimination.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>Meaningful privacy regulations, not crafted by Big Tech lobbyists, would not only protect Americans from ubiquitous surveillance, but would also level the competitive playing field.</p><p>Facebook and Google have 360-degree views of what their users read, think and do thanks to their ability to track users across millions of websites and in the real world. To get an idea, you can see all the data Google has collected on you here. </p><p>Publishers and content creators that don't read your emails, know every search you've done, track your location, know who your friends are, know every YouTube video you've watched or what you've purchased across the web, for example, can't really hope to compete with Google and Facebook for targeted advertising dollars. That's why Facebook and Google are capturing the lion's share of advertising revenue. Last year, Google's ad revenue rose to $116 billion, and Facebook's rose to $56 billion. Meanwhile, news publishers' combined ad revenue fell to $16.4 billion in 2017. </p><p>Antitrust</p><p>More aggressive enforcement of existing antitrust laws would go a long way toward opening up competition and promoting innovation. Antitrust enforcers need to do a better job of identifying and suing to block tech platforms' acquisitions of competitive threats. They need to unwind illegal mergers they didn't catch. And enforcers need to bring more monopolization cases, like United States v. Microsoft Corp., that go after anticompetitive conduct. </p><p>After all, today's tech giants are following Microsoft's playbook. In its Android case, the European Commission found that Google required phone manufacturers to install a suite of apps on Android phones as a condition of installing the must-have Google Play app, just like when Microsoft illegally maintained its monopoly power by requiring computer makers to pre-install Internet Explorer, and not its competitor Netscape.</p><p>Amazon, too, is being investigated by the European Commission for practices related to awarding the Amazon \"buy box\" that captures the majority of product sales and for how it uses merchant data. Apple has been accused of discriminating against Spotify and giving favorable treatment to Apple Music. And internal Facebook documents published by the UK parliament provide evidence of Facebook identifying WhatsApp as a competitive threat before buying it. The Clayton Act, Section 7, prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"</p><p>Interoperability</p><p>Interoperability is a tried and tested anti-monopoly tool that has been used successfully to promote innovation by reducing barriers to entering markets. For Big Tech, interoperability would allow users to authorize networks to securely communicate with each other, much like how consumers with different email services can send emails to one another.</p><p>Regulators and antitrust enforcers have imposed these requirements against AT&amp;T and Microsoft, opening up competition in long-distance calling, telephones and internet browsers. Imposing interoperability on Big Tech, which hasn't yet been done, is a powerful key to unlocking competition in the sector, and even the tech company Mozilla has advocated for interoperability to the FTC.</p><p>Non-discrimination</p><p>Tech platforms that provide essential communications and information services should be subject to rules that prohibit discrimination in price or terms, which we have repeatedly applied to network monopolies in our history. From the post office to the telegraph to cable TV, American government has required non-discrimination policies to protect the free press and democracy. Non-discrimination is the principle behind net neutrality, holding that those who control the infrastructure don't get to pick the winners and the losers of the internet. Our representatives should require the same of Big Tech.</p><p>For example, Google was found by the European Commission to have abused its dominance by prioritizing its own comparison shopping services in Google search and tweaking its algorithms to demote competitors in search results. The Commission imposed a non-discrimination remedy, requiring Google to treat competitors the same way it treats itself, but it has been accused by complainants of not properly enforcing the remedy. Google, with its 92% search market share, should not be able to bury its competitors in search results. </p><p>But why should we put America's superstar companies in PAIN? Certainly not to punish the platforms merely for being big or for being successful --- a narrative the many voices on Big Tech's payroll like to push. The Big Tech platforms argue that they provide benefits to consumers and face rigorous competition. They say they protect users' privacy and that consumers prefer the companies' products and services over the offerings of competitors that depend on their platforms.</p><p>Rather, these measures are necessary to change practices that are destroying competition and harming innovation. A major problem is that the dominant tech platforms are internet gatekeepers that also compete against companies that must get through their gates to reach users. But of course, this is not a fair competition. Rather, tech platforms have platform privilege --- the incentive and ability to prioritize their own products and services over competitors'. Tech platforms get to both umpire the game and play in it, too.</p><p>A fine alone is not a real consequence. When it comes to fixing Big Tech, if it doesn't hurt, it doesn't work. And while requirements to adjust business models and practices may be painful for the tech giants in the short term, such changes will be sweet medicine for competition. Loosening the grip of internet gatekeepers will make our markets function again, give entrepreneurs and disruptive innovators a fair shot, and ensure that no one company has too much control over speech or commerce. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But even multibillion-dollar fines don't cause tech giants enough pain to stop bad behavior. For Big Tech, fines are a rational cost of doing business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, for example, has handed over more than $9 billion to the European Commission since 2017 for antitrust violations, without skipping a beat. And immediately after reports earlier this month that Facebook would settle with the FTC, the company's stock rose nearly 2%.</p><p>Instead of fines, changing destructive business models and anticompetitive practices is the only way to lessen the platforms' harms. These fixes fall into four main buckets, spelling out the acronym PAIN: privacy, antitrust, interoperability and non-discrimination.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>Meaningful privacy regulations, not crafted by Big Tech lobbyists, would not only protect Americans from ubiquitous surveillance, but would also level the competitive playing field.</p><p>Facebook and Google have 360-degree views of what their users read, think and do thanks to their ability to track users across millions of websites and in the real world. To get an idea, you can see all the data Google has collected on you here.</p><p>Publishers and content creators that don't read your emails, know every search you've done, track your location, know who your friends are, know every YouTube video you've watched or what you've purchased across the web, for example, can't really hope to compete with Google and Facebook for targeted advertising dollars. That's why Facebook and Google are capturing the lion's share of advertising revenue. Last year, Google's ad revenue rose to $116 billion, and Facebook's rose to $56 billion. Meanwhile, news publishers' combined ad revenue fell to $16.4 billion in 2017.</p><p>Antitrust</p><p>More aggressive enforcement of existing antitrust laws would go a long way toward opening up competition and promoting innovation. Antitrust enforcers need to do a better job of identifying and suing to block tech platforms' acquisitions of competitive threats. They need to unwind illegal mergers they didn't catch. And enforcers need to bring more monopolization cases, like United States v. Microsoft Corp., that go after anticompetitive conduct.</p><p>After all, today's tech giants are following Microsoft's playbook. In its Android case, the European Commission found that Google required phone manufacturers to install a suite of apps on Android phones as a condition of installing the must-have Google Play app, just like when Microsoft illegally maintained its monopoly power by requiring computer makers to pre-install Internet Explorer, and not its competitor Netscape.</p><p>Amazon, too, is being investigated by the European Commission for practices related to awarding the Amazon \"buy box\" that captures the majority of product sales and for how it uses merchant data. Apple has been accused of discriminating against Spotify and giving favorable treatment to Apple Music. And internal Facebook documents published by the UK parliament provide evidence of Facebook identifying WhatsApp as a competitive threat before buying it. The Clayton Act, Section 7, prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"</p><p>Interoperability</p><p>Interoperability is a tried and tested anti-monopoly tool that has been used successfully to promote innovation by reducing barriers to entering markets. For Big Tech, interoperability would allow users to authorize networks to securely communicate with each other, much like how consumers with different email services can send emails to one another.</p><p>Regulators and antitrust enforcers have imposed these requirements against AT&amp;T and Microsoft, opening up competition in long-distance calling, telephones and internet browsers. Imposing interoperability on Big Tech, which hasn't yet been done, is a powerful key to unlocking competition in the sector, and even the tech company Mozilla has advocated for interoperability to the FTC.</p><p>Non-discrimination</p><p>Tech platforms that provide essential communications and information services should be subject to rules that prohibit discrimination in price or terms, which we have repeatedly applied to network monopolies in our history. From the post office to the telegraph to cable TV, American government has required non-discrimination policies to protect the free press and democracy. Non-discrimination is the principle behind net neutrality, holding that those who control the infrastructure don't get to pick the winners and the losers of the internet. Our representatives should require the same of Big Tech.</p><p>For example, Google was found by the European Commission to have abused its dominance by prioritizing its own comparison shopping services in Google search and tweaking its algorithms to demote competitors in search results. The Commission imposed a non-discrimination remedy, requiring Google to treat competitors the same way it treats itself, but it has been accused by complainants of not properly enforcing the remedy. Google, with its 92% search market share, should not be able to bury its competitors in search results.</p><p>But why should we put America's superstar companies in PAIN? Certainly not to punish the platforms merely for being big or for being successful ? a narrative the many voices on Big Tech's payroll like to push. The Big Tech platforms argue that they provide benefits to consumers and face rigorous competition. They say they protect users' privacy and that consumers prefer the companies' products and services over the offerings of competitors that depend on their platforms.</p><p>Rather, these measures are necessary to change practices that are destroying competition and harming innovation. A major problem is that the dominant tech platforms are internet gatekeepers that also compete against companies that must get through their gates to reach users. But of course, this is not a fair competition. Rather, tech platforms have platform privilege ? the incentive and ability to prioritize their own products and services over competitors'. Tech platforms get to both umpire the game and play in it, too.</p><p>A fine alone is not a real consequence. When it comes to fixing Big Tech, if it doesn't hurt, it doesn't work. And while requirements to adjust business models and practices may be painful for the tech giants in the short term, such changes will be sweet medicine for competition.

One witness in the 18-month inquiry into the way digital platforms have transformed the flow of information describes the current use of technology as \"hijacking our minds and society\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, commissioned by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, concludes that \"political choices might be influenced by online information\". It goes on to say: </p><p>We must use technology, instead, to free our minds and use regulation to restore democratic accountability. We must make sure that people stay in charge of the machines.</p><p>It is an indisputable conclusion. But there is a lot less certainty around what this regulation should look like. I would argue that the algorithms that are used by Facebook and other digital media can only be controlled by algorithmic regulation. </p><p>The two key recommendations of the report are an investigation into Facebook's data use and anti-competitive practices. This followed conclusions that \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Facebook's policies\" and \"it is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws\". Damian Collins MP, chair of the committee behind the report went so far as to say: \"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\"</p><h>A new approach</h><p>Regulatory scrutiny requires large volumes of information and evidence. But the pace at which platforms such as Facebook's evolve and innovate is much faster than the time needed by the authorities to scrutinise them. Hence, evidence-based regulation is necessarily out of sync with the algorithms that control flows of information in the digital age. If there are data breaches or users are manipulated - as the report found took place with regard to voting - it is too late to regulate this after the fact.</p><p>A new approach to regulation is necessary. One that is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.oecd.org/competition/algorithms-collusion-competition-policy-in-the-digital-age.htm\">based on the use of algorithms</url> to monitor digital platforms. These regulatory algorithms should be designed to collect real-time information on how the platforms shape what users see on their news feeds and timelines. They can adapt as the algorithms used by platforms adapt.</p><p>This requires an understanding of key features of different platforms, such as the role of specific, influential users who are responsible for shaping opinion across the network. If regulators want to encourage digital literacy and get users to slow down (as the report recommended), algorithms can monitor the ways that platforms encourage the opposite. </p><p>When it comes to competition, the barriers to entry are high. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are built on what economists call <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/4/11/17226430/facebook-network-effect-video-explainer\">network effects</url> - the more people using them, the more useful they are. This makes them natural monopolies. They use algorithms to boost their reach by constantly suggesting new connections to current users, thereby increasing the switching costs if users want to change to another platform. Regulatory algorithms could be designed to calculate in real time the size of direct and indirect connections for each user, and use them as a proxy for their psychological costs of switching networks.</p><p>Another issue for competition watchdogs is that the metrics they traditionally use to monitor market power are rendered obsolete by the business models of social media platforms. It is very difficult to measure the market share of a platform. Even if you know the number of registered users, each one should have a different weight based on their number of connections, which should in turn be weighted depending on the number of their connections. </p><p>One way to do this is for algorithms to produce synthetic measures of the relevance of each connection. This would follow a logic similar to that used by Google in ranking the relevance of search suggestions, considering not only immediate connections, but also the sequence of their weighted connections, measuring how central various users are to the network. Thus, they could provide a much better approximation of market shares. </p><p>Until now, big tech companies have largely been left to regulate themselves. The UK report rightly challenges this and makes clear that this era of self-regulation must end. But, more than this, a concerted effort is needed to develop new tools to face the scale and, critically, the timing of the threats posed by the enormous market power concentrated in the data centres of a few dominant platforms. </p><p>If social media platforms can deploy advanced algorithms to process information on their users in real time, while simultaneously learning from this data, regulators must do the same in terms of monitoring them. The priority for policy makers must switch to prevention, rather than investigating and punishing abuses after society is already damaged. Regulatory algorithms can react in real time to the strategies of various platforms, thereby improving the likelihood of people staying in charge of the machines.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emanuele Giovannetti is currently vice rapporteur for the Study Group 1 Question 4.1 of the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) of the International Telecommunication Union, representing Anglia Ruskin University as Academia member of the ITU.

One witness in the 18-month inquiry into the way digital platforms have transformed the flow of information describes the current use of technology as 'hijacking our minds and society'. The report, commissioned by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, concludes that 'political choices might be influenced by online information'. It goes on to say: We must use technology, instead, to free our minds and use regulation to restore democratic accountability. We must make sure that people stay in charge of the machines. It is an indisputable conclusion. </p><p>But there is a lot less certainty around what this regulation should look like. I would argue that the algorithms that are used by Facebook and other digital media can only be controlled by algorithmic regulation. The two key recommendations of the report are an investigation into Facebook's data use and anti-competitive practices. This followed conclusions that 'the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Facebook's policies' and 'it is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws'. Damian Collins MP, chair of the committee behind the report went so far as to say: 'Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.' A new approach Regulatory scrutiny requires large volumes of information and evidence. But the pace at which platforms such as Facebook's evolve and innovate is much faster than the time needed by the authorities to scrutinise them. Hence, evidence-based regulation is necessarily out of sync with the algorithms that control flows of information in the digital age. If there are data breaches or users are manipulated - as the report found took place with regard to voting - it is too late to regulate this after the fact. A new approach to regulation is necessary. One that is based on the use of algorithms to monitor digital platforms. These regulatory algorithms should be designed to collect real-time information on how the platforms shape what users see on their news feeds and timelines. They can adapt as the algorithms used by platforms adapt. Not enough competition? Wachiwit / Shutterstock.com This requires an understanding of key features of different platforms, such as the role of specific, influential users who are responsible for shaping opinion across the network. If regulators want to encourage digital literacy and get users to slow down (as the report recommended), algorithms can monitor the ways that platforms encourage the opposite. When it comes to competition, the barriers to entry are high. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are built on what economists call network effects - the more people using them, the more useful they are. This makes them natural monopolies. They use algorithms to boost their reach by constantly suggesting new connections to current users, thereby increasing the switching costs if users want to change to another platform. Regulatory algorithms could be designed to calculate in real time the size of direct and indirect connections for each user, and use them as a proxy for their psychological costs of switching networks. Another issue for competition watchdogs is that the metrics they traditionally use to monitor market power are rendered obsolete by the business models of social media platforms. It is very difficult to measure the market share of a platform. Even if you know the number of registered users, each one should have a different weight based on their number of connections, which should in turn be weighted depending on the number of their connections. One way to do this is for algorithms to produce synthetic measures of the relevance of each connection. This would follow a logic similar to that used by Google in ranking the relevance of search suggestions, considering not only immediate connections, but also the sequence of their weighted connections, measuring how central various users are to the network. Thus, they could provide a much better approximation of market shares. Until now, big tech companies have largely been left to regulate themselves. The UK report rightly challenges this and makes clear that this era of self-regulation must end. But, more than this, a concerted effort is needed to develop new tools to face the scale and, critically, the timing of the threats posed by the enormous market power concentrated in the data centres of a few dominant platforms. If social media platforms can deploy advanced algorithms to process information on their users in real time, while simultaneously learning from this data, regulators must do the same in terms of monitoring them. The priority for policy makers must switch to prevention, rather than investigating and punishing abuses after society is already damaged. Regulatory algorithms can react in real time to the strategies of various platforms, thereby improving the likelihood of people staying in charge of the machines.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook Privacy UK Competition UK politics Regulation Digital economy Information Silicon Valley Social networks Data privacy UK law Cambridge Analytica Platforms</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>MENAFN1902201901990000ID1098142201</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098142201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFY-J5X1-F04Y-T10F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A date for launch in Australia has not been announced.</p><p>The product will be different in each market based on user preferences and regulatory constraints, but no decisions have been made around what the news tab should look like outside the US.</p><p>A News Corp spokesman declined to comment. News Corp is publisher of The Australian.</p><p>Other outlets that agreed to participate include USA Today owner Gannett Co, the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Conde Nast, NBC News, ABC News, Bloomberg Media and BuzzFeed News, but the financial terms of each arrangement have not been disclosed.</p><p>Facebook has said it plans to include news from as many as 200 publications, although many won't receive licensing fees, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Among those that are paid, the fees may vary considerably. In its discussions ahead of the launch, Facebook had offered hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers, a few million for bigger ones, and substantially more for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with those talks.</p><p>While Facebook will have the ability to choose any headline from media outlets that have joined, only a small number would appear in the feed - some chosen by human curation and others by Facebook's algorithms. When users click on a link within Facebook, they will be sent to the publisher's site.</p><p>\"People want and benefit from personalised experiences on Facebook but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience. We want to support both,\" Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice-president for news partnerships, wrote in a blog post.</p><p>The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>In Australia, digital platforms Facebook and Google and news publishers are awaiting a government response to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission's digital platforms inquiry, which was released publicly in July.</p><p>Facebook's new service comes after Apple revealed its own news partnership with more than 300 magazines and several digital media outlets and newspapers called Apple News+. Apple's deal sees publishers split 50 per cent of the revenue based on readership of their stories.WITH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-39a217ccf86611e990dee5ef1e6dd983f71740028064dfca2b073ca8102fbc0d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC7-VNC1-JD3N-53KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The outlets in talks with Facebook include Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Business Insider, BuzzFeed, HuffPost and the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p><p>The licensing fees Facebook is offering range as high as $US3m ($4.45m) a year for national news outlets to several hundred thousand dollars for regional publications. The deals would be for three years.</p><p>Facebook plans to expand the number of publishers included in the program as the product develops. The feed will become more customisable and individually targeted, and will eventually include links from Facebook's local-news project, \"Today In\".</p><p>The company's move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Alphabet's Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.</p><p>News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed chief executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organisations that provide quality news. News Corp is the Journal's and The Australian's parent company.</p><p>Facebook will highlight only publishers that meet the criteria of its news page index, which requires sites to focus on news reporting and bars those that repeatedly share misinformation and bombard readers with advertising. But the company, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, has been mindful to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, one person said. For example, while stories from Infowars won't be included, stories from Breitbart might appear, this person said.</p><p>\"We've been working closely with news organisations to get this right by emphasising original reporting and making it much easier to find the most relevant news on Facebook,\" said Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice-president of global news partnerships. Headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be chosen in some cases by a team of editors and in others by the company's -algorithm.</p><p>The \"Top News\" section, which will feature about 10 headlines, will be entirely curated by human editors. News in subsections, such as sports or entertainment, and a \"suggested for you\" section, will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising and all stories will -direct readers to the publishers' own websites.Facebook's curators will use a detailed list of criteria for which stories to highlight, including promoting outlets that were the first to report the news. Stories with named sources might also be given priority.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-77624d4ae3f611e9a54c51fe182cdb3bd608b8a7dcc2afaf8d854233ce80a5f0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-SHV1-JD3N-537D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

So we're committed to these reforms,\" Mr Frydenberg added.</p><p>Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which drew up the draft code in May, refused to comment on whether the code would still be workable if Facebook removed all news content from its news feeds, but his predecessor, Professor Fels, wasn't so hesitant.</p><p>The former chairman of the ACCC said that if Facebook dropped out, the government may be forced to drop the code and pull out an even bigger stick, a tax on the company.</p><p>\"The government and the ACCC have anticipated [Big Tech's refusal to join in the code] and drawn up draft legislation that'll be harder to avoid,\" Professor Fels said, referring to the way big tech companies have simply exited markets when threatened with regulation.</p><p>\"And also they've got a very big stick in the cupboard. They could drop the code and just apply a tax - a general tax on digital transactions. And the platforms have far more to lose from that.\"</p><p>Facebook breaks silence</p><p>Facebook said in a<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker> blog post</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> the draft code, which came out of the ACCC's efforts to curb the power of Big Tech, \"misunderstood\" the nature of content sharing on the internet, and would do \"damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect\".</p><p>The ACCC maintains that there is a power imbalance between big, usually US-based platforms, such as Google and Facebook, and the smaller Australian media companies whose news articles appear on those platforms.</p><p>In April, the Morrison government asked the ACCC to draft a code of conduct for Big Tech, and in May the regulator proposed a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC%20-%20Mandatory%20news%20media%20bargaining%20code%20-%20concepts%20paper%20-%2019%20May%202020.pdf\">Mandatory News Media Bargaining Code</url>\" to redress that imbalance by forcing Google and Facebook, initially, to pay for the content they use, or face fines that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>\"Assuming this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/facebook-and-google-face-10m-for-media-code-breaches-20200731-p55h6p\">draft code becomes law</url>, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" Will Easton, the managing director of Facebook in Australia &amp; New Zealand said in the post. Facebook purchased Instagram for about $US1 billion in 2012.</p><p>\"This is not our first choice - it is our last. But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.\"</p><p>In 2020 alone, Facebook had already sent an estimated $200 million worth of traffic to Australian news organisations at no charge, Mr Easton said.</p><p>The social media giant proposed to the ACCC that it bring its yet-to-be-launched Facebook News service to Australia, which would have given it the ability to pay media companies directly for the content appearing in that service, but that offer had been rebuffed, he said.</p><p>\"Instead, we are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way,\" Mr Easton said.</p><p>Mr Frydenberg admitted Facebook's services were great products enjoyed by millions of Australians.</p><p>\"People love them.

So we're committed to these reforms,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which drew up the draft code in May, refused to comment on whether the code would still be workable if Facebook removed all news content from its news feeds. But his predecessor, Professor Fels, was not so hesitant.</p><p>The former ACCC chairman said if Facebook dropped out, the government may be forced to drop the code and pull out an even bigger stick, a tax on the company.</p><p>\"The government and the ACCC have anticipated [big tech's refusal to join in the code] and drawn up draft legislation that'll be harder to avoid,\" Professor Fels said, referring to the way big tech companies have exited markets when threatened with regulation.</p><p>\"And also they've got a very big stick in the cupboard. They could drop the code and just apply a tax - a general tax on digital transactions. And the platforms have far more to lose from that.\"</p><p>Facebook said in a blog post the draft code, which came out of the ACCC's efforts to curb the power of big tech, \"misunderstood\" the nature of content sharing on the internet, and would do \"damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect\".</p><p>The ACCC maintains there is a power imbalance between big, usually US-based platforms, such as Google and Facebook, and the smaller Australian media companies whose news articles appear on those platforms.</p><p>In April, the Morrison government asked the ACCC to draft a code of conduct for big tech, and in May the regulator proposed a Mandatory News Media Bargaining Code to redress that imbalance by forcing Google and Facebook, initially, to pay for the content they use, or face fines that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>\"Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" Will Easton, the managing director of Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, said in the post. Facebook purchased Instagram for about $US1 billion in 2012.</p><p>\"This is not our first choice - it is our last. But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.\"</p><p>In 2020 alone, Facebook had already sent an estimated $200 million worth of traffic to Australian news organisations at no charge, Mr Easton said.</p><p>The social media giant proposed to the ACCC that it bring its yet-to-be-launched Facebook News service to Australia, which would have given it the ability to pay media companies directly for the content appearing in that service, but that offer had been rebuffed, he said.</p><p>\"Instead, we are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way,\" Mr Easton said.</p><p>Mr Frydenberg admitted Facebook's services were great products enjoyed by millions of Australians.</p><p>\"People love them. And we want those to continue here in Australia. But we also believe our world-leading reforms based on the work of the ACCC is the future for a more sustainable media environment,\" he said.</p><p>Labor's communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said the threats by Facebook and Google \"proves\" their dominant market power and the imbalance in bargaining with traditional media outlets.</p><p>Ms Rowland, a former commercial lawyer who worked on telecommunications, media and technology deals for a decade before entering Parliament, backed the ACCC's crackdown.</p><p>\"They [Facebook] need to come to the table and all parties need to be constructive if news media is going to survive in this country,\" she said.</p><p>Mr Sims described Facebook's threat yesterday to block news links as \"ill-timed and misconceived\", and urged the company to engage in constructive discussion.</p><p>He also refuted Facebook's suggestion that news was a tiny part of its operations, quoting the University of Canberra's 2020 Digital News Report, as saying 39 per cent of Australians use Facebook for general news, and 49 per cent use Facebook for news about COVID-19.</p><p>\"Facebook already pays some media for news content.

Her hope: to try and take back the White House in 2016. We'll go to Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And firefighters in Colorado have contained about 30 percent of a huge wildfire near Colorado Springs. And they're hoping cooler temperatures and calmer winds will help even more. But the fire has already taken its toll, 473 homes have been destroyed and two people have died. Some evacuation orders are still in place, but others in Colorado Springs were lifted last night.</p><p>And a second blast in two days has left another person dead at a chemical plant in Louisiana. This latest incident happened last night at a plant about 40 miles south of Baton Rouge in Donaldsonville. The plant manager said nitrogen was being unloaded from a tanker truck when a small vessel ruptured.</p><p>The explosion killed a 55-year-old man and injured eight others. Two people died and more than 100 were injured on Thursday at a nearby plant.</p><p>And Facebook is opening up in the only way the government will allow them. The company is revealing just how often any form of law enforcement, not just the National Security Agency, asks for data on you.</p><p>And it turns out the company says that less than 1 percent of its billion plus users are being asked about it. Facebook says in the last half of 2012, it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests from law enforcement, impacted between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts. Let's go to CNN's Money's Laurie Segall with us now. So these are requests, does Facebook give the government what it wants every time?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: You know, it's an ongoing conversation. They have to come with certain requests and they comply about 79 percent all the time. That is you know that's lower than some of the other tech companies, Fredricka, but these requests, when they come in and this is what they wrote about in this blog post that came out.</p><p>They said this helps with a sheriff looking for a missing child or the national security official investigating a specific terrorist threat, so it's that kind of information that they're using and what I think we try to wrap our heads around, what exactly are they asking for and is it going to affect us.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And I understand the Justice Department is also responding to these disclosures and apparently, this is really never been done before to what extent?</p><p>SEGALL: You're absolutely right. The Department of Justice just recently just came out and said OK, we're authorizing some of these companies to be a little bit more transparent, to release some of this data, so let me read you some of what they said in a statement earlier.</p><p>They said a grand jury subpoena or search warrant in a criminal matter or a national security letter this is the kind of stuff that we're going to see in these transparency reports. You know, also, the publication they say will show that a small number of accounts are subject to legal process.</p><p>So Fredricka, I think what they want us to realize and what some of the transparency is going to do is show us that the government isn't just getting access to all Facebook accounts. It is a very small number of accounts that's being affected and they want that out there.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So here we're hearing from Facebook, now what about other tech giants like Microsoft or perhaps even Google?</p><p>SEGALL: We're hearing more and more. So Microsoft actually has said it's received between 6,000 and 7,000 warrants. This is going to affect about 30,000 customers. We're now hearing from Google. Google has always published -- Google has published transparency reports now. This is a different kind of report.</p><p>They're pushing back a little bit and we're also hearing from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in general that maybe haven't been reached out to, but they say this has huge implications for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and for tech companies. I actually sat down with Alexis Ohanian. He is the founder of Reddit, he had some thoughts on this. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, FOUNDER, REDDIT: It will come up a lot sooner for founders and founders who were maybe thinking move fast and break things are going to be thinking move fast and break things, but don't break the constitution. And I think this is an opportunity for us as citizens to really start to draw a line in the sand for what is off limits. What is still private? Even in the digital age.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: And we just keep hearing, I get off the phone with any Silicon Valley entrepreneur and they say transparency is key and that's what we're going to be hearing about as more of these tech companies come forward. We're seeing -- we're beginning to see a little bit more about what the government has access to.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Laurie Segall, thanks so much.</p><p>All right, the man who triggered the scrutiny on the tech giants was a focus of a rally in Hongkong today. Edward Snowden, who <person><nameText>leaked </nameText></person>the documents that revealed that the U.S. government is snooping on many, well, apparently, we know he has fled to Hongkong. Several hundred supporters marched through the city, demanding protection for Snowden. Reuters said the turnout was very modest and reportedly, about a third of those attending were actually journalists. We'll have much more on the demonstration in just a few minutes.</p><p>Breaking news out of south western Pakistan, a deadly hostage situation at a hospital there is now over. Twenty three people in the end were killed in the siege and at a separate bus blast today. Our Saima Mohsin in live now in Islamabad, so Sima, two attacks in one day. But the feeling is these are linked and it began with a situation at a bus, correct?</p><p>SAIMA MOHSIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. This morning, a devastating day for Pakistan and people in south western province when a bomb went out of a university transportation bus that was taking young women and their teachers all of them happened to be women, those that were killed, 11 of them into the city center.</p><p>In fact, there were 35 to 40 of them on board. Eleven of them were killed. When the dead and injured from that incident were taken to hospital then the militants struck again. Two suicide bombers detonated their bombs, one outside the emergency room, and another outside an operating theatre. We don't know if there are casualties from that because this has been an ongoing siege we've seen here throughout the day.</p><p>It's night time now and we're only just being told by police officials on the ground, hundreds of them, by the way, who had to surround the hospital, who are now going through that building, room by room, to ensure that people are safe and that all the militants have been cleared. At one point, they believed there were eight inside there, but they're now telling us there were four.</p><p>Perhaps two of them died as suicide bombers. Two have been arrested. They don't know who these militants are or why they were doing this, but for now, people are safe. Hundreds of people who are being held hostage, patients, doctors and nurses, seen for now to be safe and sound -- Fredricka.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So Saima, on the bus attack, the majority of the victims were women. Was this a specifically, you know, targeted mission as far as you know?</p><p>MOHSIN: Well, until of course we find out who was behind this, it's really difficult to say the motive. But of course, this will bring us back to memories of Malala who was shot by the Taliban and women's education being targeted. Of course, that would also be a big question. Just to put some context for you about this part of Pakistan.</p><p>It's facing a separatist movement, a several armed groups fighting for this particular province to be separated from the rest of Pakistan. We haven't seen attacks like this before on women or educational institutions, but in fact this attack potentially is the first attack on women as a university so, a really shocking attack, a devastating one.</p><p>People reviled by up and down the country, but who is behind it, we don't know and what their motive was, but right now, people are thinking perhaps this is yet another attack by a separatist movement.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Saima Mohsin, thanks so much.</p><p>All right, back in the states here now, politics. <person><nameText>Sarah Palin, </nameText></person>guess what? She's back in the spotlight. The former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee has just joined rejoined, we should say, Fox News and is headlining a conservative conference taking place in Washington right now.</p><p>CNN's political editor, Paul Steinhauser, is at the Faith and Freedom Coalition rally. So Paul, there have been a number of people on docket to speak, but it's the keynote speaker, <person><nameText>Sarah Palin, </nameText></person>that has so many people just highly anticipating what she'll say and if in any way, she will influence the political landscape.</p><p>PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR: Yes, Fred, I guess you could say they saved the best for last. She is the last major speaker at this three-day conference, but this is <person><nameText>Sarah Palin's </nameText></person>crowd. No doubt about it. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, they've been doing this for four years now.</p><p>This is a big gathering of social conservatives from across the country, one of the largest gatherings this year. And that is a crowd that is still very, very popular, very influential with <person><nameText>Sarah Palin. </nameText></person>She really speaks to these people and they are very much so waiting to hear what she has to say.</p><p>This is her second major speech this year. She addressed the CPAC conference earlier this year and we can't wait to hear what she has to say today about probably 2014 elections, the 2016 elections and the Obama administration what's going on right now -- Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So Paul, what about Texas Governor Rick Perry, he apparently made an appearance earlier today. Is he saying anything about his political future?</p><p>STEINHAUSER: -- wants to know, A, will Rick Perry run for re-election as governor next year and B, I guess, even more important is he going to make another bid for the White House in 2016? He was the first speaker here this morning. You know, he didn't talk about that. He didn't make any big news, but he did make some fun of himself about some of his gaffes from his bid for the White House in 2012. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: -- favorite disciples was Peter, you think about Peter that is the same Peter who denied Christ three times, the same Peter who was rebuke d by Paul concerning justification by works, this is the same peter whose mouth sometimes ran faster than his brain. Let me tell you, I can relate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEINHAUSER: And you know what's funny? He actually made another minor gaffe here today. He was talking about the incident in Libya last year when four Americans including our ambassador died, but he said Lebanon instead of Libya. Fred, Rick Perry is one of about five or six people who may be thinking about running for the White House in 2016 on the Republican side who all came here to this conference to talk to this conservative crowd -- Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK, a lot on tap there. All right, Paul Steinhauser, thanks, at the Faith and Freedom Conference, although it sounds like you're at a golfing match or something like that, but I understand because people are speaking behind you and you don't want to disruptive, very polite. Thanks so much, Paul.</p><p>All right, get ready for, guess what? A new way of waking up in the morning, in just two days, the debut of CNN's morning show \"NEW DAY\" begins with Chris Cuomo, Kate Bolduan and Michaela Pereira. \"NEW DAY\" starts Monday morning at 6:00 a.m. Do not miss it.</p><p>It's breaking news out of Iran, moderate cleric, Hassan Rowhani, has won the presidential election there. The Interior Ministry has confirmed the results. Iranian officials say turnout was high.</p><p>And coming up, the ongoing search for Edward Snowden, the man who exposed government snooping. He's out of sight, but the city that he fled to has a rally for him. We're talking about Hongkong. Hear why it may have disappointed some.</p><p>And Ariel Castro's own lawyer admits his crimes were horrendous, but he's trying to keep his client off death row. Find out why the prosecutors just might agree.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, he is the man whose leak rocked the federal government. Edward Snowden is not charged yet for revealing U.S. government surveillance of your phone calls, but officials say it's just a matter of time. And as they investigate, Snowden's supporters demonstrate in the city he's believed to be hiding out, Hongkong. Here's CNN's Nic Robertson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They came for Edward Snowden to help protect him from possible prosecution. A rally in the rain in the heart of a city he claims is targeted by NSA hackers. Organizers hope for hundreds, they got maybe 300 about a third, journalists covering the event.</p><p>This speaker, one of three legislators voicing concern over Snowden's fate, not surprised by the low turnout.</p><p>CLAUDIA MO, HONGKONG LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL: The crowds here just couldn't care less. Uninvited guest was dispatched into Hongkong. What's that about? The authorities deal with it.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): Perhaps not the numbers organizers were hoping and hard to blame it on the weather, too. The protest took place just a couple of days ago, there were between 50,000 and 150,000 people and it was pouring down with rain.</p><p>(voice-over): Snowden gave away his most valuable asset, his location. Checking out of this hotel barely 12 hours later, he seemed to have second thoughts or maybe not.</p><p>(on camera): Perhaps hiding here in the shadows in Hongkong was a carefully calculated choice. Searching from here could be like looking for a needle in a hay stack. This is one of the most densely, populated cities in the world. Seven million people live here, 5 million of them computer users with some of the fastest internet access in the world. Could this be a cyber spooked nirvana?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he's trying to get his story out, it's a very wise choice.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): David Hodson was assistant police commissioner here, says Snowden will need more than his cyber savvy to dodge detection.</p><p>DAVID HODSON, FORMER ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HONGKONG POLICE: We live in the real world. You have to eat food. You have to sleep. In my mind, there is no such thing as a secret.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Although, he is still technically free, should an arrest warrant come. He'll go on a watch list, unable to leave legally.</p><p>HODSON: So, maybe they'll start looking for information they've got already.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): The clock may already be ticking.</p><p>HODSON: I would imagine it almost certainly has been ticking.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Outside the U.S. Consulate, Snowden supporters hand over a letter to President Obama. Still hoping they can muster enough outrage to keep Snowden out of jail. Nic Robertson, CNN, Hongkong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And back in this country, a big car maker is facing some big legal trouble. The federal government says BMW is treating its African-American workers in this country unfairly. Our legal guys tell us what that's all about.</p><p>And Tiger Woods is playing through pain at the U.S. Open. We're live at the tournament after this.</p><p>WHITFIELD: A military judge has rejected the defense strategy for the accused Fort Hood shooter. Major Nadal Hasan told the judge he was trying to protect the Taliban in Afghanistan when he killed 13 people at the base in 2009. The judge ruled there was no immediate threat by anyone at the army post to people in Afghanistan. Hasan is acting as his own attorney.</p><p>Accused kidnapper, rapist and murderer, Ariel Castro pleads not guilty to all 329 counts against. Castro is accused of holding three women against their will in his Cleveland home for a decade. Prosecutor says the women were brutalized and tortured quote/unquote \"beyond comprehension.\"</p><p>Listen to this twist. One of Castro's own attorneys agreed. Let's bring in our legal guys, Avery Friedman, a civil rights attorney and law professor joining us from Cleveland. Good to see you.</p><p>AVERY FRIEDMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Hi, Fredricka.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And Richard Herman, a New York criminal defense attorney and law professor joining us from Las Vegas, good to see you as well. OK, so gentlemen, you know, one of Castro's attorneys talked to reporters after arraignment and admitted for the first time that some of the 329 charges are quote, \"horrendous and indisputable.\" So Avery, what's going on here, that the defense attorneys would speak out like this?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I don't know what planet this defense team is on. I mean, look at, if you're --</p><p>HERMAN: Really?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: If you're depending a reptile like this, you have to say look at, the constitution guarantees my client a defense and I'm going to do the best I can to protect those rights. The idea of saying for example, there's no dispute about the crimes. He also said one of the other lawyers said well, he's a wonderful father and a family man. What on earth? I just think it's the wrong way to go and I think it's prejudicial to the right of the defendant.</p><p>WHITFIELD: But there had to be some strategy here then, Richard. What is it? I mean, the not guilty pleas are being entered. But not necessarily because the defense feels that it can dispute the charges or that he could actually be acquitted, but what is behind this sentiment being expressed by the defense attorneys?</p><p>HERMAN: There is a strategy here, Fred. The strategy is to kiss the butt of the prosecutor because you don't want to see a death penalty case here. That's where it's at, Avery. That's the strategy. You've got to make nice to the prosecutor and get a plea deal here that will spare his life, life in prison. Waive your appellate rights.</p><p>Make that deal now so he doesn't face the death penalty because, you know, that's one of the states that gives certain legal rights to unborn children and so, if they want to go on an aggravated murder and death penalty, they have the option to go there.</p><p>What the defense attorney is being realistic -- defense attorneys can be realistic, they're looking at the overwhelming evidence here. They see there is no defense to this case and they're going to try to cut a deal as quick as possible.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So, Avery, with that kind of negotiation, doesn't that ordinarily take place before the arraignment, to try to get some sort of plea deal or is it customary that it would happen after the arraignment, after the plea is entered in court and then the negotiations begin?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, it actually, in a case like this, that's so horrendous, we have 329 counts and Fredricka, we're going to see about another 300 or 400 counts, so yes, in a case like this, the effort has been made from the beginning. Remember, Castro originally waived some rights after he waived Miranda and he's been singing like Edward Snowden. There are admissions already as part of the record. So while I understand what Richard is saying, I think there are ways of doing that that are without going public and making statements like that. I think it's inappropriate.</p><p>HERMAN: While he's in prison, they're watching him every 10 minutes. They are checking on him to make sure he's still alive. No, no, from the other inmates.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I see what you're saying. All right, OK, let's move on to the next case, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filing suit against BMW and Dollar General, put those two in the same category. But it's being alleged that both companies des criminate against African-Americans. The issue is criminal background checks. Both companies apparently using them and the EEOC says they can result in discrimination against African-Americans, who have higher arrest rates than white. So Richard, explain this from top to bottom, the policy, response and these background checks.</p><p>HERMAN: The policy at the BMW plant was simply this, check and see if any of our employees have criminal histories. If they do and the criminal history was in the past seven years, we're not going to let them work here. If it's not within the past seven years, we're going to allow them to continue to work. Then what happens is a new regime comes in and they say blanket. If you have a criminal history, a criminal record, you can't work here. Well, 70 of the 87 employees were African-Americans so they were all terminated. Claims were made through the EEOC. They're claiming racial discrimination here. Fred, it takes one negligence lawsuit for an employer to be retaining an employee with a bad criminal history and next thing you know --</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No, no.</p><p>HERMAN: You've got a problem. That's what the case is about.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK, Avery, you're in total disagreement.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, absolutely. Look, this case is predicated on a regulation that's 14 months old. And if you use, if you use criminal background checks to systemically discriminate against black people and it doesn't relate to the job, then it's appropriate to proceed with this prosecution. I actually think if the EEOC, if the government can show they're doing those two things, systemically discriminating and if the conviction doesn't relate to the job, I think they're going to prevail. You can't use a criminal background check to keep people from unemployed. Why would for example --</p><p>HERMAN: Yes, you can.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Why would a drug possession have anything to do with being a waitress for example? If it were embezzlement -- well, it does happen all the time.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Keep someone from actually getting a job.</p><p>HERMAN: Whether they're violent felony convictions. That should be the test.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then quickly, we did try to get a comment from Dollar General. It has not commented, but BMW spokesperson said this rather to the \"Atlanta Journal Constitution.\" Quote, \"BMW believes that it has complied with the letter and spirit of the law and will defend itself against the EEOC's allegations of race discrimination,\" end quote.</p><p>Tip of the iceberg on this case and we'll be revisiting it and we'll be revisiting you. See you again in about 20 minutes to talk about another case involving the lyrics to the song, happy birthday. We won't be singing it. Until we try to revolve this case by way of our Avery and Richards perspective.</p><p>Meantime, police thought they closed one cold case when they nabbed the suspected murder, but then he started confessing to even more killings.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, as promised to the Faith and Freedom Conference right now and key note speaker, former Alaska Governor <person><nameText>Sarah Palin. </nameText></person><person><nameText>SARAH PALIN </nameText></person>(R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- get more and more surreal. I was going to ask Ralph, too, if he'd encountered in protesters here. If there are any protesters, speak now or forever hold your peace because facing the protesters, facing critics is something I do well. And easy to put them in the parking lot in their itty bitty purple volts. What gives them away is that re-elect Obama bumper sticker. It might as well say yes, I'm still dense.</p><p>Really, I rolled my truck window down as I pulled up to these guys, some of them, and said, really? Why? Really wanting to know what is their thinking. Why would they support failed policies and one reply I got before the 2012 race, a guy said, well, I'm not a racist, so I voted for him to prove it. And I replied nor am I a racist and buddy, next time vote for someone else to prove you're not a knuckle head.</p><p>But now more than ever, it just seems so Orwellian around here. You know, 1984 and before this 1984, terms like leading from behind meant following and like the other day, the White House testifying for Congress, bragging that they used the least untruthful statements. Now, where I come from, that's called a lie. Yes, officials lied and governments spied and in Benghazi, government lied and Americans died.</p><p>But finally around here, those scandals are being revealed. Finally, you know, people are waking up to what's going on and these scandals are coming at us so fast and furious. And kind of remind me of a comedy routine that my friends at \"Saturday Night Live\" do. They should think of me as a friend, you know, for a while there, I was providing more job security for the Tina Feys of the world and doing more for those employment numbers than Obama's ever done.</p><p>But what SNL does is they have this skit where they do this fake newscast and read some completely absurd news report and then they finish it with an incredulous, really? Well, as in our government spied on every single one of your phone calls, but it couldn't find two pot smoking dead beat Bostonians with a hotline to terrorist central in Chechnya, really?</p><p>And -- it's built apparatus to sneak into all of the good guy's communications, but whoops a daisy, it missed the mass murder of its own troupes, despite this terrorist declared in numerous sessions and business cards, but oops, no red flags there, really? And our government passing something called Obamacare, but the affordable care act.</p><p>I'll repeat that, the affordable care act. And its chief result? Making our health care premiums enormously unsustainably more expensive with death panels to boot and now, hiring up to 16,000 to 20,000 perhaps armed IRS agents to implement this act. Well, the IRS, it can't figure out how it managed to spend over $4 million on a training conference because it didn't keep its receipts, really?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, there, you're listening to <person><nameText>Sarah Palin, </nameText></person>part comedian, part pundit there, at the Faith and Freedom Conference there in Washington. We'll continue to monitor her comments there and check in with our reporters who are on the scene as well. Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State <person><nameText>John Kerry </nameText></person>is speaking out on Syria. He says the use of chemical weapons and the involvement of Hezbollah, quote, \"threaten to put a political settlement out of reach,\" end quote. As violence continues in the region, the U.S. says it plans to send small arms ammunition and anti-tank weapons to Syria's rebels.</p><p>And families in Colorado are starting to find out if their homes are among the hundreds that burned in the wildfire. Officials say 473 homes around Colorado Springs are lost. An I-reporter sent us this time lapsed video showing all the smoke rising. Crews have contained about 30 percent of the fire and calmer weather could help firefighters this weekend.</p><p>All right, <person><nameText>Nelson Mandela </nameText></person>reportedly is doing better. The South African civil rights leader's grandson has confirmed the news. According to the South Africa's news agency, the 94-year-old has been in serious, but stable condition since being rushed to the hospital with a recurring lung infection earlier this month.</p><p>And it's one of the most crucial parts of any trial, finding an impartial jury. That's what lawyers are trying to do right now in the George Zimmerman trial. Our legal guys will be back to weigh in on that case.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, instead of taking to the high seas for cruise, some people are finding a more intimate experience floating down a river. Holly Firfer is on the go like Huckleberry Fin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLLY FIRFER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): River cruising is becoming a popular way to see America.</p><p>STEPHANIE OSWALD, \"TRAVELGIRL\" MAGAZINE: Whenever you cruise on a river, you learn so much more about a place. You get to see not only the landscape and topography sailing by you, but you get to meet the people, everything from dance to food to music. It's really a great to feel just the culture of a region.</p><p>FIRFER: You can cruise on many waterways across the country. From the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the Pacific Northwest to the Hudson River, which carries ships through New York and just like Mark Twain, you can cruise the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.</p><p>OSWALD: But the smaller ships sail for a more intimate experience and there are also a lot of themed journeys, so you want to find the one that's right for you.</p><p>FIRFER: River cruises carry around 150 passengers so you avoid the crowds on the megaships. A river cruise costs more than an ocean cruise, but the price often includes your drinks and shore excursions.</p><p>ASHLEY HICKS, CRUISE PASSENGER: It's different than a normal ocean cruise. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Nice. All right, so for more on river cruising, go to cnn.com/travel.</p><p>All right, would you pay $150,000 bucks to sing happy birthday, the song that you traditionally sing for free? How about with a price tag now? The company that own it is song, they say, says that you could owe that much if you don't pay a fee to them. Sounds like a case for our legal guys to tackle.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, jurors in the George Zimmerman trial will be sequestered. The trial could last two to four weeks actually. Our legal guys are back, Avery Friedman in Cleveland and Richard Herman in Las Vegas. OK, gentlemen, Zimmerman is charged with second degree murder in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.</p><p>Yesterday was the fifth day of jury selection and lawyers on both sides are asking potential jurors what they know and how they feel about teenager's death last year. Richard, apparently, the group size has been whittled down 29. So, what is the makeup ideally of a jury in a case like this?</p><p>HERMAN: You know, Fred, -- you need a juror to speak the truth. You don't want a juror who comes in with preconceived notions and ideas about a case. You don't want jurors who are posting on Facebook about the case and then lying to the judge when asked are you posting on Facebook.</p><p>These stealth planes that fly under the radar, some of these come in with an idea that one way or the other, they're going to convict or acquit. You don't want that either. You want someone to come in and give your client a fair shake.</p><p>That's what our system is all about. That's what this is trying to ensure. Very difficult, Fred, especially in a high profile case like this where the jury will be sequestered.</p><p>WHITFIELD: In a case like this, high profile, it seems nearly impossible, really, to find impartial juror, so what's I guess the room being made by the attorneys? You know, that they are going to have jurors that know about the case, but two what extent?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, that's the key in boudoir. Both by the prosecution and defense to probe, to inquire, to determine if you have impartial individuals who will serve on this jury, but the very courageous ruling this week by Judge Deborah Nelson, this is a big deal, that sequestering a jury is expensive, complicated, but it's the right thing to do. It will be two to four weeks, but it really is one way of controlling, limiting information getting to those jurors and that is a courageous and appropriate ruling and that's good for everybody.</p><p>WHITFIELD: It would almost seem like you would have to.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: A lot of judges won't. This is a big deal.</p><p>HERMAN: Fred, you have to and it will go more than a month, this trial. Two to four weeks is wrong.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Wow, interesting. It is fascinating and we're still in jury selection. Let's move on to this case, some might call it a little crazy. Talking about it involving the song, happy birthday, but now, it's the heart of a class action suit. A group doing a documentary on the song says the song written back in 1893 should be considered part of a public domain. The suit aims to block a music company from claiming it owns the copyright to the song and charging licensing fees for its use.</p><p>So who knew that happy birthday was copyrighted. Anyone who performs this song publicly from this point forward or pending the outcome of this case risks a $150,000 fine if they don't agree to pay a fee? Avery, under what circumstances are you going to -- what are you going to pay it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: To Warner Chappelle, this claims it has the copyright. They're making $2 million a year from film and television alone. The plaintiff in this case has been paying them. What's really fascinating here and I think this is just terrific. I love this case. Someone is actually saying show me the copyright or is this merely a nursery rhyme from the 19th Century? That's the issue. That's what a court has to decide in the federal district court there in Manhattan and I think it's a blockbuster case and I'm not sure who's going to win this one.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So, when we say performing publicly, are we talking about for profit? If they are collecting already when it's in a movie or in some sort of on stage production, Richard? We're not talking about when you're at the kitchen table or in your house and you're singing this song happy birthday and you've got an audience there.</p><p>HERMAN: You owe, Fred. You owe. It's a different copyright there.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: That's right.</p><p>HERMAN: I think that you know, they want to argue it's a public domain and argue that the song has gone through machinations over the years. It's not the original song. I got to believe a couple million dollars a year in revenue based on happy birthday, that's pretty amazing and they may have to return some of that money if they lose the case.</p><p>WHITFIELD: You don't think the copyright will hold?</p><p>HERMAN: No, I read the copyright has expired.</p><p>WHITFIELD: There's an expiration date?</p><p>HERMAN: Let's all get together and sing that.</p><p>WHITFIELD: After the case is over. How about that? I don't have that kind of money. HERMAN: Good point.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Richard, Avery, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Always good to see you. All right, of course, the legal guys, we enjoy them every Saturday at about this time, giving us their take on the most intriguing legal case of the day, the week, the month, you name it.</p><p>All right, on the sports coming up, Tiger Woods is powering through pain to try to knock Phil Mickelson and Billy Horschel off the top of the leader board at the U.S. Open. Don Riddell is joining us live from the tournament from Pennsylvania with this \"Bleacher Report\" update. Give us the scenario out there. I know you're not going to whisper even though Paul Steinhauser was whispering. What's up?</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS: You know, I can speak at full volume because I'm actually a fairway from the practice range here. The actual golf course is a mile away because of how they've had to set everything up here at Merion. They call third round moving day. The big question is which direction are the players moving because this golf course was really, really tough on Friday.</p><p>Phil Mickelson is absolutely right up there. He is one of only two players under par. He sunk a brilliant birdie on the 18th late last night to get himself to 1 under par, which means he'll play in the final group today. He's had so many heartbreaking run-ins with the U.S. Open over the years. He's finished second a record five times. He's desperately hoping he can win it this time.</p><p>Tomorrow is his birthday, by the way. Of course, Tiger Woods is always in contention or at least his fans would hope that he always is. He's 3 over par, 4 off the lead. But it's a nice, warm day here, the greens will be playing pretty hard and fast and I think that will suit his game, but he's never won a major from that far back before.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Wow. But anything can happen. That's the best thing about golf. You can't count someone in or out until that last hole is played. Don, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Some bicycles are built for two. This one is built to fly, but only if you're planning a short trip. Looks fun there, doesn't it?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Just two days away from the premier of our new morning show right here on CNN. It's called \"NEW DAY.\" It begins Monday morning, 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Chris Cuomo, Kate Bolduan and Michaela Pereira will start your day with everything you need to know and you don't want to miss it. It's 6:00 a.m. right here \"NEW DAY.\"</p><p>All right, here's one you have to see to believe, a flying bicycle. Three companies in the Czech Republic teamed up to make this contraption. Why, you ask, because they could. Big propellers of course there, keeping it up in the air. Almost like an airboat, right, but with pedals. It's operated by remote control as you see there, but it only stays in the air for about 5 minutes before the battery power runs out. A guy climbed up on the top of an electrical tower and then star started taking his clothes off. Another why? Why? Why did he do this? On a cruise in Los Angeles rerouted the power so the man wouldn't get electrocuted, bizarre behavior. He stayed on the tower for about four hours and finally, police convinced him to climb into a cherry picker and they brought him down unharmed.</p><p>I guess he wanted a little extra attention. You want to keep it right here all afternoon. We've got new royal revelations. I'll get all the details from a royal historian. People give their money to charities, thinking it will go to help sick people. But our investigative report says that doesn't always happen. You'll want to see this.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2013061501CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58NK-CPM1-DXH2-61DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6194\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 15, 2013 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000CURX</classCode><className>HEZBOLLAH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But they're also tops for lobbying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook and Amazon.com spent more on lobbying Congress and federal agencies this year so far than any other publicly traded companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to an Investor's Business Daily analysis of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying\">data from the Center For Responsive Politics</url>. And they're among just nine S&amp;P 500 companies ranked in the top 20 spenders on lobbying in 2020.</p><p>Big technology's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/spy-stock-buy-now/\">outsize role in the S&amp;P 500</url> continues to draw scrutiny. CEOs of Facebook and Amazon, plus those at Alphabet and Apple endured hours of questioning about their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibd-tipp-poll-majority-support-breakup-big-tech-avoid-monopoly/\">market power</url> before a House judiciary subcommittee on Wednesday. All four tech giants' shares rose anyway.</p><p>\"These are among the most dominant, richly valued companies in history, and have become interwoven into the lives of pretty much every human being on earth,\" said Whitney Tilson of Empire Financial Research. \"They warrant careful scrutiny by investors, the public, the media and political leaders.\"</p><h>Big S&amp;P 500 Lobbying Spenders: Facebook And Amazon</h><p>Facebook, technically in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/\">communications services sector</url>, spent $10.1 million on lobbying so far this year. That's more than any other individual company. The social media company's lobbying spending is also trending higher than its record $16.71 million spent in all of 2019.</p><p>Both Amazon and Facebook individually spend more on lobbying than each of the top defense contractors.</p><p>Facebook spends more on lobbying than any other company. And yet, it ranks No. 7 among all spenders. That's because organizations usually spend more than individual companies.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent $36.9 million on lobbying in 2020. That's more than anyone else. And many drug companies lobby indirectly through the Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America. The group spent $14.6 million on lobbying in 2020 so far.</p><p>Consumer discretionary Amazon is just behind Facebook on lobbying spending at $9.2 million in 2020 so far. That's well above the $7.5 million defense contractor Raytheon Technologies has spent on lobbying in 2020.</p><p>Amazon's stock, alone, accounts for nearly 5% of the S&amp;P 500.\u00a0Shares of Amazon are up 64% this year \u2014 topping all the big tech rivals, giving it an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/\">IBD Composite Rating of 98</url>.</p><h>Apple And Alphabet Spend Less</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-analysts-one-companys-profit-will-finally-surpass-apples/\">Apple is worth more</url> than any of the big technology-related companies that appeared in Congress, north of $1.6 trillion. It also accounts for 5.7% of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>But Apple spends well below its size in lobbying, $3.6 million in 2020. That doesn't even rank Apple in the top 20 biggest spenders on lobbying this year. And last year, Apple dropped $7.41 million for lobbying, less than Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p>And Alphabet, too, is one of the smaller spenders. It's put just $4.1 million toward lobbying this year. That's also not enough to put it in the top 20 spenders. It's actually a bit of a cutback. Last year, Alphabet spent $12.8 million on lobbying, enough to rank it 19th among all spenders.</p><p>But soaring market values aren't about lobbying, they're <url normalizedValue=\"https://leaderboard.investors.com/\">about profit and growth</url>. As shown by powerful rallies in the S&amp;P 500 winners, investors are willing to pay up. Just 10 stocks account for 30% of the S&amp;P 500's index market value.</p><p>\"Do I think these companies are going to change much \u2014 or that regulators might force them to change or even break them up?

Aunque posteriormente ha aclarado que seguramente sea en Suiza y no en Estados Unidos donde se gestione esta regulaci\u00f3n. \"Sabemos que debemos tomarnos tiempo para hacerlo bien. Y quiero ser claro: Facebook no ofrecer la moneda digital de Libra hasta que recibamos las respectivas aprobaciones\", explica el testimonio[1]. Durante las pasadas semanas, la criptomoneda de Facebook ha recibido numerosas crticas. Entre ellas las de organizaciones tan influyentes como la Reserva Federal de los EE.UU, quien a travs del Sr. Powell[2] declaraba que \"Libra pone en duda el sistema financiero y bancario a nivel mundial\". Tambin el propio Donald Trump[3] publicaba una serie de sus populares tuits donde afirmaba que Libra tendr \"poca importancia o fiabilidad\".Una preocupaci\u00f3n que tambin se extiende al Departamento del Tesoro, quien ha declarado a travs del secretario Steven Mnuchin[4] que \"Libra podra ser usada para el lavado de dinero y por terroristas financieros\".  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.xataka.com/criptomonedas/stablecoin-que-no-se-puede-minar-lenguaje-programacion-propio-reserva-opaca-asi-se-diferencia-libra-resto-criptomonedas\">https://www.xataka.com/criptomonedas/stablecoin-que-no-se-puede-minar-lenguaje-programacion-propio-reserva-opaca-asi-se-diferencia-libra-resto-criptomonedas</url> En Xataka[5] Una 'stablecoin' que no se puede minar, con lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n propio y una reserva opaca: as se diferencia Libra del resto de criptomonedas[6]  Facebook est preparada para una larga y exhaustiva regulaci\u00f3n La criptomoneda Libra est prevista para ver la luz en 2020 y cuenta con el apoyo de ms de una treintena de empresas[7] entre las que se encuentran algunos gigantes como Mastercard, Visa, Paypal o eBay. Un movimiento con suficiente tir\u00f3n como para alertar a los distintos bancos que estn preocupados por la privacidad y la estabilidad financiera del sistema tradicional. Seg\u00fan David Marcus, la persona designada por Facebook para llevar el proyecto de Libra: \"Para que quede claro, la Asociaci\u00f3n Libra espera que tenga licencia, est regulada y est sujeta a supervisi\u00f3n. Debido a que la Asociaci\u00f3n tiene su sede en Ginebra, ser supervisada por la Autoridad de Supervisi\u00f3n de Mercados Financieros de Suiza\". Respecto a las dudas sobre la privacidad y la seguridad del consumidor, Marcus ha explicado que \"los estados individuales tendrn voz y sern (en el caso de EE.UU) la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Comercio y la Oficina de Protecci\u00f3n Financiera del Consumidor quienes velarn por ello\". Just caught up with comments from @federalreserve[8] Chairman Powell at his @FSCDems[9] Hearing, and I fully agree that legitimate concerns about @Libra_[10] should be addressed carefully and patiently, and that it shouldn't be rushed. This is why we shared plans early. \u2014 David Marcus (@davidmarcus) 10 de julio de 2019[11] El responsable de Facebook asegura que Libra no competir con las monedas nacionales ni socavar el papel de los bancos centrales. Una promesa que muchos siguen sin creer como es el caso de los congresistas dem\u00f3cratas, quienes estn considerando impulsar una ley[12] que detenga los planes de Facebook en el mundo de las criptomonedas. \"El lanzamiento de Libra est dise\u00f1ado para ser un proceso abierto y sujeto al escrutinio regulatorio\". Un proceso que, seg\u00fan espera el propio Marcus, \"ser la revisi\u00f3n ms amplia, extensa y cuidadosa de la historia de las 'fintech'\". En Xataka | Libra es la apuesta de Facebook y las multinacionales por domar el espritu de bitcoin y las criptomonedas originales[13] Tambin te recomendamos  El gran reto de Facebook con Libra es hacer que la criptomoneda sea estable, y no lo va a tener nada fcil [14]   Bitcoin supera de largo los 10.000 d\u00f3lares y puede que Libra, la criptomoneda de Facebook, haya tenido la culpa [15]   As es

The social media giant plans to begin its cryptocurrency[2] program \u2014 which has been in the works for months \u2014 by 2020. Facebook is also expected to have 100 partners by that time, The New York Times[3] reported Tuesday. Partners include Mastercard, Visa, Uber, Spotify, eBay and Paypal, which are all expected to make investments of $10 million.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) The program will allow users to send money to their contacts, even those who live in different countries[4], through a regulated subsidiary called Calibra in a matter of seconds. Libra, which defines itself as 'a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people,' will also be backed by federal currencies so its value will not fluctuate any more than the money we use today. </p><p>'It feels like it is time for a better system,' David Marcus, head of Facebook's blockchain technology research, told the NYT. 'This is something that could be a profound change for the entire world.' But in attempting to jumpstart this change, Facebook will likely be challenged with state cryptocurrency regulations[5] that have slowed the progress of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value almost quadrupled in 2017, sparking the interests of not only average Americans and investors but U.S. banks and the government. Because such a currency does not have a central authority and cannot be tracked, it has become a useful form of payment for criminals involved in drug[6] and human trafficking[7], among other felonies.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) While the Federal Government has yet to regulate cryptocurrency[8] due to its blurry design between being a security and a commodity, Congress has cracked down[9] on Facebook for putting the privacy[10] of its users at risk by sharing information with advertisers so ads could be targetted. A combination of the two will be an effort neither Congress nor Big Tech has tackled before. Since Facebook's and Libra's partnership announcement Tuesday morning, Bitcoin's value went up 12%, trading at about $9,190, the Wall Street Journal [11]reported.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook has been rapidly assembling a blockchain team[1] tasked to work with the nascent technology. It also recently opened a position[2] for a blockchain lawyer to help potential business partners. </p><p>The social media giant is also looking for venture capital firms to invest up to $1 billion in its blockchain project, according to a report[3] by Fortune. Payments giant PayPal has also begun investing in blockchain technology. It recentlyjoined a Series A funding round[4]for Cambridge Blockchain, a digital identity software provider that combines blockchain with an off-chain personal data service to validate the identity of parties, legal entities and devices, according to a press release.A new phase of adoption?One major suggestion presented by this type ofnews is that we might be entering a new phase of blockchain adoption. \"These movements are the signals that are critical to the next run of adoption,\" Joseph Weinberg, chairman ofShyft, a blockchain network provider, said in an interview. \"What this says is the blockchain space is at an inflection point [and] is now at the stage that the big tech companies can begin to play ball. This is open innovation, which means every incremental step has a large multiplier effect.\" Weinberg also said that when big organizations like Facebook begin moving forward, it will encourage other companies to do the same. \"The horse has left the stable and the speed that this space will move now that the giants are pushing will be greater than anything we've seen before,\" Weinberg said. \"In my opinion blockchain has reached its adoption phase.\" A possible dangerThere is a potential dark side to Facebook and PayPal becoming major players in the market:While they will likely spark more innovation in the field and demonstrate that blockchain is a \"safe space,\" they also might use blockchain technology unethically, said Cahill Puil, CEO and founder of Byte Media Group, a marketing company for blockchain and tech groups. \"We've got to remember that it's Facebook \u2014 they're the wolf in sheep's clothing,\" Cahill said. \"This is the same company who'shistorically known to abuse power and not give a crap about customers. Their 'Sorry Apology Tour'continues month after month with hits such as: 'Millions of passwords exposed,' 'Spying on your phone', 'Sharing your private health data' and many, many more.\" Cahill also emphasized that Facebook has conveniently entered the blockchain space, \"when regulators are still trying to figure out what the heck a Facebook profile is all about,let alone what blockchain is.\"The true opportunityIt is unclear whether Facebook or PayPal will become the next leader in blockchain technology, but Alex McDougall, chief information officer of Bicameral Ventures, a blockchain investment company, believes it is certainly a possibility. \"Can Facebook make a fundamental change in their business model?,\" he asked. \"It's not just about adopting a technology that's not just a tool that's layered on top of an already iffy foundation. This is the opportunity for Facebook to be the platform powering a new era of digital interaction. If they can.\" The opportunity here is not just for big companies, but also for startups that coulduse the hype around blockchain to push forward with innovative blockchain solutions for every industry from the smallest retailer to the biggest bank.

As part of a settlement, the company was also ordered to create a new privacy committee on its board and to make other structural changes to increase the transparency and accountability of its data practices. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But the agreement was criticized for failing to limit Facebook's gathering, sharing and use of people's personal information, a practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions. And the F.T.C.'s commissioners were divided on partisan lines this month when they voted 3-to-2 to approve the measures, which provide immunity to Facebook's officers and directors and shield the company from known claims of violations through last month -- essentially giving it a pass on its past.</p><p>  At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a $100 million penalty against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The S.E.C. said Facebook had known for two years about that misuse, but had presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.</p><p>  Hours later, Facebook also disclosed that it was the target of an antitrust investigation by the F.T.C. While the agency was known to be looking into the company and whether it had used its reach and clout to reduce competition, a formal investigation starts a more intensive phase of examination. The company also confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it this month as part of the agency's sweeping antitrust review of the tech giants, which it made public on Tuesday.</p><p>  The developments highlighted the new reality for big tech companies: Scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers has become a constant.</p><p>  For the past few years, American regulators appeared to be lagging as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The contrast was starkest with European officials, who have passed laws and imposed a series of large penalties against big tech companies. But in recent months, American lawmakers and regulators have also ramped up their activity.</p><p>  ''The online technology industry and our company have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter,'' Facebook said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said at an employee meeting at the company's headquarters in Silicon Valley that he supported the privacy settlement with the F.T.C. and that it would change the way the social network operated because ''if we don't, then we're going to be held accountable for it.''</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg did not specifically address the antitrust concerns but said on a conference call with investors, ''with the guidance and expectations from regulators, we have a clearer path forward.'' He called for more government oversight of the tech industry at large.</p><p>  The F.T.C. confirmed the antitrust investigation against Facebook and declined to comment further.</p><p>  The agency's five commissioners put out dueling statements on the privacy settlement. The three Republican commissioners -- including the F.T.C. chairman, Joseph J. Simons -- who voted to approve the deal said they were ''proud'' of the agreement and believed the measures ''will provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data.''</p><p>  But the two Democratic commissioners disagreed. One of them, Rohit Chopra, warned that the terms of the settlement legally shielded Facebook from liability for a wide range of past problematic practices. ''This shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,'' he said.</p><p>  Even as the scrutiny around Facebook has grown, its business has remained strong. It said on Wednesday that revenue for its second quarter rose 28 percent from a year ago to $16.9 billion. While profits fell 49 percent to $2.6 billion because of a one-time $2 billion charge to pay the F.T.C.'s fine and an accounting charge related to tax deductions, Facebook still performed better than Wall Street had expected.</p><p>  ''Facebook, with all of its missteps over the past two years, is going to remain a strong stock over the next few years,'' said Shawn Riegsecker, chief executive of the ad-technology company Centro.</p><p>  The F.T.C.'s privacy settlement with Facebook follows an investigation over the past year into whether the company had violated a 2011 privacy agreement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the social network had said it would not deceive people over how their information was used and shared.</p><p>  Then last year, a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London  revealed how Facebook had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica had used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.</p><p>  In its settlement with Facebook on Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had mandated that the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board to review decisions affecting user privacy. That would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to unilaterally make decisions, the agency said.</p><p>  The F.T.C. also ordered Facebook to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data. All of these would increase Facebook's transparency and accountability, the agency said.</p><p>  Yet the F.T.C.'s two Democratic commissioners said the measures were inadequate. Facebook's officers should be held personally liable for privacy transgressions, they argued, and more needed to be done to curb the company's data-mining practices. They also said that a $5 billion fine was a drop in the bucket.</p><p>  ''When companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,'' Mr. Chopra said in his dissent.</p><p>  The three Republican commissioners said that the $5 billion fine was ''record breaking'' and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases.</p><p>  They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable -- and far more certain -- than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle.</p><p>  ''Is the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?'' they said. ''If the answer had been 'no,' it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was 'yes.'''</p><p>  Lawmakers were sharply critical. The F.T.C. agreement ''utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,'' said Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri.</p><p>  Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, said the F.T.C.'s antitrust investigation represented a commitment of staff and agency resources. ''It also suggests there is reason to believe there is anticompetitive behavior to look at,'' he said.</p><p>  The F.T.C.'s lengthy privacy inquiry into Facebook could well have brought out evidence that helped persuade the agency to pursue an antitrust investigation, said Mr. Gavil, who is a former senior F.T.C. official.</p><p>  Investigations can take months or even years. They result in staff presentations, by the agency's economic bureau and by its competition bureau, made in private to the five commissioners. The politically appointed commissioners then decide whether to bring a case or not, or try to reach a settlement.</p><p>  Unlike with the privacy case, there is no provision for fines in a civil antitrust case. But what can happen, if a corporate defendant is found to have violated the nation's antitrust law, is follow-on cases by private plaintiffs such as other companies.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

More than 70% of internet traffic, nearly half of e-commerce.' </p><p>One of her competitors, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has already gone after Amazon to try to get the shipping and Internet giant to boost wages.</p><p>Sanders introduced legislation, named after Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, that would seek to tax companies whose workers are forced to rely on government benefits for health care and living costs.</p><p>The acronym comes from its title: 'Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies.' </p><p>On Saturday, Warren defended her plans to tackle the tech giants, saying 'boo-hoo' to her critics.</p><p>'The monopolists will make fewer monopoly profits. Boo-hoo,' she told the crowd at the South by Southwest festival.</p><p>'The whole idea behind this is for the people in this room. It's for people who are tech entrepreneurs it's for people who have small businesses and want to grow big businesses, it's for people who have medium sized businesses and want to grow them,' she said, adding she didn't want big companies to use their information and power to crush the smaller ones. </p><p>'We want to keep that marketplace competitive and not let a giant who has an incredible competitive advantage snuff that out.' </p><p>Warren has also said she would appoint regulators who would rely on existing antitrust laws 'to break up mergers that reduce competition'.</p><p>She said they would rely on those tools to 'unwind anti-competitive mergers, including: Amazon: Whole Foods; Zappos, Facebook: WhatsApp; Instagram, Google: Waze; Nest; DoubleClick'. </p><p>In her pitch to rein in the influence of tech giants, the senator envisions legislation targeting companies with annual worldwide revenue of $25 billion or more, limiting their ability to expand and forcing parts of Googleand Amazon's current business structure to operate as separate entities. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether Warren will introduce legislation in the current Congress aligning with the first element of her plan. A spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said a bill introduction was not imminent. </p><p>In her medium post, Warren said: 'As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people.</p><p>'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52515880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-FTH1-F021-6022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><timeReceived>10:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

But at least one company, already under the microscope, isn't just looking to pick off competitors. Facebook has its eyes on the supposed cops on this beat, the antitrust enforcement officials ready to jump ship.Barbara Blank just joined[2] Facebook in April 2020 after over a decade as an attorney in the Bureau of Competition's Anticompetitive Practices Division[3] (ACP). Blank was the division's deputy assistant director since 2014, and she led staff attorneys in the FTC's investigation of Google's search practices. </p><p>Her role in the ACP -the center of the competition bureau's enforcement efforts against industries other than healthcare, pharma and tech \u2014 offers Blank in-depth knowledge on the FTC's enforcement practices regarding intellectual property rights 'and immunities from and exceptions to the antitrust laws.'Crucially, the ACP division focuses on not only enforcing but 'shaping[4] the law,' suggesting Facebook's interest in the most recent policy changes at the FTC. It seems reasonable to assume that Facebook intends to take advantage of Blank's connections with, and knowledge of, ACP officials still at the FTC. The officials who are now causing headaches for Facebook used to report to Blank, after all.Now, as a director and associate general counsel of competition at Facebook, Blank will help the company 'develop[5] legal strategy in connection with competition review of mergers and acquisitions by regulators.' Translation: it's her job to shepherd Facebook through the FTC's current investigation[6] of its past acquisitions unscathed. The job listing also alludes to Facebook's preference for insider experience by requiring 'significant competition experience, including deep knowledge of competition frameworks in the US and other jurisdictions, and engagement with applicable regulatory bodies in merger review and/or investigative contexts.'Blank is just one of many lawyers who left their job enforcing antitrust law only to take jobs at the corporations the FTC oversees. She joins an outflow of FTC officials to Silicon Valley in 2020, as Amazon recently hired two FTC attorneys and an economist. The Revolving Door Project found[7] that 36 of 71 Bureau of Competition lawyers who left the FTC from 2014 to 2019 are now representing corporate clients at BigLaw firms. In addition, at least six FTC lawyers became in-house counsels at acquisition-fueled corporations.While antitrust appointees on both sides of the aisle tout their resumes defending corporate clients, staff lawyers with little hope to ascend to the top ranks in government also see private sector experience as the path to promotions and higher salaries. This incentivizes lawyers to keep prospective private sector employers in mind while carrying out enforcement ostensibly in the public interest.Blank will profit, likely tremendously, from her spin through the revolving door as Facebook seeks to fend off activist energy calling their monopolistic practices into question. As Facebook would put it, hiring Blank is a strategic purchase of 'human capital.' Activists who hope to ultimately break up Facebook will not only have to have the best legal arguments, but recognize that they will not be arguing before neutral enforcers: there are very real incentives that currently sway the thinking of senior 'career' officials at the antitrust regulators.The FTC and DOJ only function effectively if their legal staff don't see serving the public as a stepping stone to a lucrative job undermining their own prior work. We in the public would all be better off if we made these 'career jobs,' well, actual 'careers' again.

The investment is the biggest the social networking giant has ever made and places a huge bet on the developing market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"With this deal, the borders between utility and platform businesses are blurring,\" says Dario Talmesio, a principal analyst and the practice leader for 5G and European TMT research at Omdia. \"In essence, with the help of Facebook we might see the first example of a telecom operator turning into a digital commerce platform after years of industry fearing that the opposite would have happened.\"</p><p>The collaboration will allow Jio to lower its debt of around 400 billion Indian rupees ($5.2 billion). For Facebook, which already counts India as one of its largest markets, it promises further engagement with Indian citizens, and especially with the country's small and midsized enterprises.</p><p>The landmark deal values Jio Platforms at INR4.62 trillion ($60.2 billion), assuming a conversion rate of INR70 to the dollar. Jio, which launched services in 2016 and has more than 300 million subscribers, will continue to remain a subsidiary of Jio Platforms. (See Facebook likes Reliance Jio.)</p><p>Big deal targeting India's small businesses</p><p>\"This partnership will accelerate India's all-round development, fulfilling the needs of Indian people and the Indian economy,\" said Reliance Industries in a press release. \"Our focus will be India's 60 million micro, small and medium businesses, 120 million farmers, 30 million small merchants and millions of small and medium enterprises in the informal sector, in addition to empowering people seeking various digital services.\"</p><p>With more than 300 million subscribers, Facebook has a massive presence in India. Moreover, WhatsApp, the messaging service it owns, has more than 400 million users in the country and has developed several tools, including a payment system, for small businesses. Facebook has also created digital storefronts to allow entrepreneurs to sell goods and services online.</p><p>Facebook's hope is that collaboration with Jio Platforms will boost engagement with India's community of small businesses. \"One focus of our collaboration with Jio will be creating new ways for people and businesses to operate more effectively in the growing digital economy,\" said David Fischer, Facebook's chief revenue officer, and Ajit Mohan, its Indian managing director, in a joint statement. \"For instance, by bringing together JioMart, Jio's small business initiative, with the power of WhatsApp, we can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience.\"</p><p>Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail and WhatsApp have also entered into a commercial partnership to \"further accelerate Reliance Retail's [the retail arm of Reliance Industries] new commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp,\" says Reliance Industries.</p><p>JioMart is a platform for small merchants and small grocery stores. Facebook and Jio are to \"work closely to ensure that consumers are able to access the nearest kiranas [neighborhood small grocery stores] who can provide products and services to their homes by transacting seamlessly with JioMart using WhatsApp,\" they say. (See India's Jio, Facebook team on multi-purpose app ? report.)</p><p>\"At the core of our partnership is the commitment that Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and I share for the all-round digital transformation of India and for serving all Indians,\" said Mukesh Ambani, the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, in a video message. \"In the post-corona era, I am confident of India's economic recovery and resurgence in the shortest period of time. The partnership will surely make an important contribution to this transformation.\"</p><p>Jio wants to become the de facto online platform for Indian consumers and is working on several products, including smart homes, connected cars, tele-health and distance learning innovations. The deal with Facebook could help to advance those goals.</p><p>While several businesses have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, digital companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google are likely to gain as lockdowns and other restrictions on movement force organizations to speed up the digitalization of business processes. (See Big Tech's 'hiring spree' will leave many behind.)</p><p>\"The country [India] is in the middle of a major digital transformation, and organizations like Jio have played a big part in getting hundreds of millions of Indian people and small businesses online,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, in a blog on his Facebook page. \"With communities around the world in lockdown, many of these entrepreneurs need digital tools they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. This is something we can help with and that's why we're partnering with Jio to help people and businesses in India create new opportunities.\"</p><p>The deal is especially significant because of Ambani's stated desire to ensure India remains in control of the data it generates.</p><p>\"Data is the new oil ? For India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, we will have to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India. In other words, Indian wealth back to every Indian,\" he is reported to have said at an event in January 2019. This was later qualified by Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, who said: \"Data isn't oil, a finite commodity to be owned and traded, pumped from the ground and burned in cars and factories. Of course, no analogy is perfect, but a better liquid to liken it to is water, with the global Internet like a great borderless ocean of currents and tides.\"</p><p>Jio recently announced a partnership with Microsoft to offer its suite of services to small businesses.</p><p>This is not the first time Facebook has tried to boost its presence in India. It launched its Free Basics plan in India in 2018, offering free access to chosen Internet services for people who could not afford 4G data plans. The program was banned by the Indian authorities because it was seen to be violating the principles of net neutrality.</p><p>\"After having experimented with free Wi-Fi access, connectivity drones and other innovative Internet-for-all initiatives, Facebook is now getting hands-on with 'traditional' connectivity,\" says Talmesio. \"The two companies share many common goals, and, surely, there will be synergies. However, it is useful to remember that Facebook has acquired a minority stake and presumably will have limited direct involvement in the daily running of the operation. But the ramifications for the wider industry are huge and this deal can be the first step of many.\"</p><p>Recently, Facebook has been trying to get approval for WhatsApp Pay, a payment platform, which is still in beta version. Collaboration with Reliance might help the company to get this rolling.</p><p>While it is not yet clear, the Jio-Facebook investment might indirectly impact the country's already stressed telecom sector. If the products it develops persuade small businesses to move to Jio, the move could stoke fears that India's telecom sector is on track to become a duopoly or even monopoly.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Light Reading India.

And over the past few months, he has promised to offer users better privacy on company-owned services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p> But improving the privacy of users will make it harder for Facebook to show them ads tailored to their interests. A virtual financial network, if it should work, would be a way for the company to find new revenue if ad sales should drop.</p><p> The payment system would also help Facebook and other U.S. companies compete for financial transactions in developing countries, where WeChat, developed by the Chinese company Tencent, already offers a highly profitable payment system built into its popular messaging product.</p><p> With Marcus, who was the president of PayPal before he joined Facebook, Zuckerberg has tapped someone who already has experience managing an alternative payment system.</p><p> The project is being planned to address skeptics. The Libra digital token will be directly backed by government currencies like the dollar or euro, according to a paper describing the technology. So unlike bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, it will not fluctuate in value any more than real-world money, and it is not likely to appeal to speculators.</p><p> Still, the wider cryptocurrency community is likely to point to Libra as evidence that digital tokens could have a mainstream purpose. Last week, as some details of the Facebook project leaked, the value of bitcoin surged.</p><p> To acquire Libra (a reference to the Roman measurement for a pound, once used to mint coins) through a new Facebook subsidiary, called Calibra, users are likely to have to show government identification like a driver's license, which would make it unappealing for black market transactions like buying drugs.</p><p>Facebook is also distancing itself from direct management of Libra. The project is to be run by a nonprofit entity in Switzerland, the Libra Association, which is independent of the social network. The association will be overseen by other companies, which will have voting power over the design and release of Libra, Facebook officials said.</p><p> While 27 companies, also including Visa, Spotify, eBay and PayPal, are on the list of partners released Tuesday, so far they have not committed to much beyond donating money and taking part in the design of the association and the currency. Each enterprise partner will be expected to invest at least $10 million.</p><p>Facebook's involvement will be handled through the subsidiary, Calibra. Company officials said Calibra would not be allowed to share any of its financial customer data with other Facebook divisions, though there may be exceptions in incidents like fraudulent activity.</p><p> \"Your financial data will never be used to target ads on Facebook,\" said Kevin Weil, vice president of product for Calibra.</p><p> The currency itself is being built so that any software developer in the world can build a digital wallet or other services on top of it, similar to the way that bitcoin can be sent between people.</p><p> The structure of the new Libra currency is based on the blockchain technology made famous by bitcoin.</p><p> The blockchain concept makes it possible to hold and move digital currencies almost instantly, usually with low transaction fees. Because blockchains are shared databases, they can function without any central operator like the central banks that have historically governed currencies. This structure will allow Libra to be overseen by many companies.</p><p> Customers will be able to hold and spend their Libra with businesses that accept the currency, and there will be services that quickly convert Libra into traditional currencies and send the money to traditional bank accounts, according to project documents released Tuesday.</p><p> While Libra is meant to be independent of Facebook, the social networking giant has clear plans for making money from the venture.</p><p> Initially, the Calibra subsidiary will offer little more than a wallet to hold and spend Libra. When Libra is released next year, the plan is to make the wallet available to the billions of people who have accounts with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p> If Libra catches on, company officials said, Facebook's Calibra could offer financial services to customers, such as lending and investing.</p><p> To spur adoption, the Libra Association, which will manage the digital token, will help offer financial incentives to merchants and customers, like free Libra for opening a wallet, or discounts on Libra transactions for merchants who accept the currency.</p><p> \"Libra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology while reducing the costs for everyone \u2014 especially consumers,\" Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments and risk at Uber, said in a statement.</p><p> The Libra project is certain to face scrutiny from regulators. In Washington, the Federal Trade Commission is considering levying a fine against Facebook that could run into the billions of dollars for repeated privacy violations.</p><p> Financial regulators in the United States and other countries could stop Libra before it is even released if there are concerns that the technology will enable money laundering or other types of crime that have become common with bitcoin.</p><p> It may also raise the hackles of those who worry that Facebook has accumulated far too much power, a concern that has led to calls to break the company into separate units.</p><p> Weil and other Facebook executives have said Libra is likely to be most attractive to people in the developing world who don't have easy access to cheap digital bank accounts and credit cards.</p><p> \"Our hope is to create more access to better, cheaper and open financial services \u2014 no matter who you are, where you live, what you do or how much you have,\" according to a paper released by the Libra Association.</p><p>Facebook is not the only big tech company with a cryptocurrency project. The messaging giant Telegram raised nearly $2 billion last year to create its own cryptocurrency, which is expected in the coming months.</p><p> Thousands of startups are still trying to build a new world of financial services on top of existing cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin remains popular with people who are concerned about personal privacy and the power that governments and big corporations have in the financial system. That could make bitcoin supporters skeptical of Facebook's project.</p><p> But Facebook has a built-in advantage: its size.</p><p> \"It will take years,\" Weil said. \"But the goal is that this is a new currency that people can trust. And it has just as many use cases as money has.\"</p><p> Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper are New York Times writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-6786b42424956c22c3d5ccda508584f5174c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCN-R2X1-DXVP-V0GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The Libra digital token will be directly backed by government currencies like the dollar or euro, according to a paper describing the technology. So unlike Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, it will not fluctuate in value any more than real-world money, and it is not likely to appeal to speculators.</p><p>Still, the wider cryptocurrency community is likely to point to Libra as evidence that digital tokens could have a mainstream purpose. Last week, as some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-new-cryptocurrency-gets-big-backers-11560463312\">details of the Facebook project leaked</url>, the value of Bitcoin surged.</p><p>To acquire Libra (a reference to the Roman measurement for a pound, once used to mint coins) through a new Facebook subsidiary, called Calibra, users are likely to have to show government identification like a driver\u2019s license, which would make it unappealing for black market transactions like buying drugs.</p><p>Facebook is also distancing itself from direct management of Libra. The project is to be run by a nonprofit entity in Switzerland, the Libra Association, which is independent of the social network. The association will be overseen by other companies, which will have voting power over the design and release of Libra, Facebook officials said.</p><p>While 27 companies, also including Visa, Spotify, eBay and PayPal, are on the list of partners released on Tuesday, so far they have not committed to much beyond donating money and taking part in the design of the association and the currency. Each enterprise partner will be expected to invest at least $10 million.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s involvement will be handled through the subsidiary, Calibra. Company officials said Calibra would not be allowed to share any of its financial customer data with other Facebook divisions, though there may be exceptions in incidents like fraudulent activity.</p><p>\u201cYour financial data will never be used to target ads on Facebook,\u201d said Kevin Weil, vice president of product for Calibra.</p><p>The currency itself is being built so that any software developer in the world can build a digital wallet or other services on top of it, similar to the way that Bitcoin can be sent between people.</p><p>The structure of the new Libra currency is based on the blockchain technology made famous by Bitcoin.</p><p>The blockchain concept makes it possible to hold and move digital currencies almost instantly, usually with low transaction fees. Because blockchains are shared databases, they can function without any central operator like the central banks that have historically governed currencies. This structure will allow Libra to be overseen by many companies.</p><p>Customers will be able to hold and spend their Libra with businesses that accept the currency, and there will be services that quickly convert Libra into traditional currencies and send the money to traditional bank accounts, according to project documents released on Tuesday.</p><p>While Libra is meant to be independent of Facebook, the social networking giant has clear plans for making money from the venture.</p><p>Initially, the Calibra subsidiary will offer little more than a wallet to hold and spend Libra. When Libra is released next year, the plan is to make the wallet available to the billions of people who have accounts with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p>If Libra catches on, company officials said, Facebook\u2019s Calibra could offer financial services to customers, such as lending and investing.</p><p>To spur adoption, the Libra Association, which will manage the digital token, will help offer financial incentives to merchants and customers, like free Libra for opening a wallet, or discounts on Libra transactions for merchants who accept the currency.</p><p>[Get the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/TU\">Bits newsletter</url> for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]</p><p>\u201cLibra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology while reducing the costs for everyone \u2014 especially consumers,\u201d Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments and risk at Uber, said in a statement.</p><p>The Libra project is certain to face scrutiny from regulators. In Washington, the Federal Trade Commission is considering levying a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/facebook-ftc-fine-privacy.html?module=inline\">fine against Facebook that could run into the billions of dollars</url> for repeated privacy violations.</p><p>Financial regulators in the United States and other countries could stop Libra before it is even released if there are concerns that the technology will enable money laundering or other types of crime that have become common with Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, called on the company to stop the development of the Libra until regulators could closely examine the potential risks.</p><p>It may also raise the hackles of those who worry that Facebook has accumulated far too much power, a concern that has led to calls to break the company into separate units.</p><p>Mr. Weil and other Facebook executives have said Libra is likely to be most attractive to people in the developing world who don\u2019t have easy access to cheap digital bank accounts and credit cards.</p><p>\u201cOur hope is to create more access to better, cheaper and open financial services \u2014 no matter who you are, where you live, what you do or how much you have,\u201d according to a paper released by the Libra Association.</p><p>Facebook is not the only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/cryptocurrency-facebook-telegram.html\">big tech company with a cryptocurrency project</url>. The messaging giant Telegram raised nearly $2 billion last year to create its own cryptocurrency, which is expected in the coming months.</p><p>Thousands of start-ups are still trying to build a new world of financial services on top of existing cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin remains popular with people who are concerned about personal privacy and the power that governments and big corporations have in the financial system. That could make Bitcoin supporters skeptical of Facebook\u2019s project.</p><p>But Facebook has a built-in advantage: its size.</p><p>\u201cIt will take years,\u201d Mr. Weil said. \u201cBut the goal is that this is a new currency that people can trust. And it has just as many use cases as money has.\u201d</p><p>Follow Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @nathanielpopper. </p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by Delcan &amp; Co.

Continue reading Facebook plans to tie itself together as regulators debate tearing it apart</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a lengthy blog post yesterday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he wants Facebook to focus on encryption and privacy by combining its messaging products, but lawmakers and economists are worried that Zuckerberg may be attempting to outflank regulatory action.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg is taunting antitrust authorities around the world, breaking past acquisition commitments and threatening to consolidate market control,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said in a statement to The Verge.  The FTC and Department of Justice should see through this fa\u00e7ade. Big Tech will never change its invasive and anticompetitive ways until change is forced on them. </p><p> Yesterday, I suggested that our antitrust enforcers should consider unwinding anticompetitive mergers, including Facebook and Instagram,  Blumenthal continued.</p><p> We cannot allow platform integration to become privacy disintegration. </p><p>Those regulatory concerns first surfaced in January after The New York Timesreported that Zuckerberg was planning to integrate Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.  When it comes to privacy, we can no longer give Facebook the benefit of the doubt,  Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said at the time.  Now that Facebook plans to integrate its messaging services, we need more than mere assurances from the company that this move will not come at the expense of users  data privacy and security. We cannot allow platform integration to become privacy disintegration. </p><p>On January 24th, only a few days before the Times  report, groups like the Open Market Institute, Color of Change, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center penned a letter to Federal Trade Commission chairman Joe Simons, asking him to consider making significant structural changes to Facebook. In the letter, they argue that a multimillion-dollar fine would not be enough to convince Facebook to make sweeping changes to its business model; only being forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp would be enough for the company to make the serious structural changes necessary.</p><p>It was reported last month that the FTC was discussing levying a record-setting, multibillion-dollar fine on Facebook for violating the consent decree. It s unclear whether that action could include a breakup.</p><p>Last week, the FTC announced that it would be building out a task force faced with understanding and enforcing competition regulation on big tech companies like Facebook and Google. At the time of the task force s announcement, officials said that they would be actively looking into previous consummated mergers.</p><p>At the same time, European regulators are increasingly unhappy with Facebook s status quo. Last month, the European Parliament released its final report on its investigation post-Cambridge Analytica. In it, lawmakers do not explicitly saythat a break up is necessary, but that it may be worth thinking about.  The legislative tools already exist,  the report said.  They must now be applied to digital activity, using tools such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law. </p><p>In the EU, antitrust law looks dramatically different than it does in the US. European countries exhibit a competition model rather than a consumer harm model like in the US. The EU report also points to Facebook shutting down API access to apps like Twitter s former Vine product as a way to draw away competition from Instagram s new video product.</p><p>The report even cites Facebook s plan to integrate messaging services as a threat to competition.  The scale of this data sharing risks being massively increased, given the news that, by early 2020, Facebook is planning to integrate the technical infrastructure of Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, which, between them, have more than 2.6 billion users. </p><p>Josh Hawley</p><p>@HawleyMO  </p><p>The Big Tech giants regularly abuse the public trust   spying on consumers, taking data without consent, discriminating against conservatives. Then they wonder why citizens are angry? Time to hold them accountable</p><p>3,9084:12 AM   Mar 6, 2019 1,812 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy  </p><p>In the US Congress, the committees overseeing the Justice Department and antitrust generally have begun discussions about what a break-up might look like.</p><p>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing entitled  Does America Have a Monopoly Problem?  Tech behemoths took center stage for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.  Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said at the hearing.  Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies  behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights.

Facebook  shares were falling 3.77% on Thursday after the WSJ reported that federal officials  against the company over antitrust concerns. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The oversight board concept, which Facebook initially conceived in 2018, is intended to serve as an independent governance body that will guide criteria on what types of content should be removed from the platform, beyond the company's existing policies of complying with laws combined with its own frameworks for removing inauthentic or problematic activity. </p><p>The board will be comprised of up to 40 people representing a range of perspectives, Facebook has said. It issued a call for nominations to the board earlier this year. The $130 million was described as an initial commitment earmarked for operational and staff expenses and \"should allow the board to operate for at least its first two full terms, approximately 6 years.\"</p><p>However, Facebook appears to be having a harder-than-expected time identifying the makeup of the board. </p><p>\"While we had hoped to announce members by the end of this year, we've decided to take additional time to consider the many candidates who continue to be put forward,\" wrote Brent Harris, Facebook's director of governance and global affairs, in the post. He added that the board will start hearing cases next year. </p><p>Thursday's post echoed prior commentary from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has expressed discomfort with the idea that Facebook should arbitrate what constitutes acceptable speech. In a  , and later on the company's  , Zuckerberg expounded on Facebook's commitment to free speech -- even, in the case of political advertising, when it contains falsehoods. </p><p>Thursday's blog post reiterated that the content moderation board arose out of  The board's charter, which was published in September, establishes a \"speech protective\" framework, but it will be up to the oversight body to decide what is acceptable within certain gray areas, such as content that is not necessarily illegal but violates human rights norms. </p><p>Content moderation, taken more broadly to include safety and security matters, represents an  as its social platforms grow. It is also a very costly undertaking for Facebook, and the oversight board will contribute to those expenditures. </p><p>Zuckerberg said in October that Facebook's substantial investments in AI and machine learning to better weed out problematic content and accounts will not translate anytime soon into a less costly system, or reduce its need for human moderators. It currently spends roughly $5 billion per year on safety and security.</p><p> \"I don't foresee any time in the near future that AI is going to make it so that the cost comes down,\" he said. \"There's just so much content flowing through the system that we do need a lot of people looking at this. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.\"</p><p>In addition, the delay in spinning up the oversight board signals that it won't be ready in time for a ramp-up in the 2020 presidential campaign, which Zuckerberg identified in October as a pressure point for the company. U.S. political rhetoric places Facebook \"at the center of the debate,\" Zuckerberg said. </p><p>In the absence of an oversight board, that means criticisms and ire surrounding political content may be solely directed at Facebook itself -- potentially placing it, again, in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. </p><p>Facebook is one of several big tech firms under antitrust scrutiny by U.S. federal officials and a consortium of nearly all state attorneys general. </p><p>The potential FTC action reported on Thursday could seek to bar Facebook from integrating its various apps and limit how it interacts with outside tech companies. The injunction could be applied as soon as January 2020, according to the WSJ. </p><p>Facebook announced earlier this year that it aims to more closely integrate the back-ends of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC injunction, if applied, would restrict that initiative on the grounds that it may be anticompetitive and would make a forced breakup of the firm more difficult.</p><p>Shares of Facebook are up almost 50% so far this year. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-15192165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR6-DT01-F00X-J2H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><timeReceived>3:31 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Apple even breached the $1trn mark, with Amazon close behind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in late 2018, many of those companies fell heavily, mirroring a general downward turn for equities, especially US-based ones. Apple fell the most, resulting in Microsoft overtaking it in value over the last few weeks. At the time of writing, Microsoft has a market cap of $750bn, with Apple down to $718bn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But others weren't far behind, with Facebook falling from over $600bn to $380bn and IBM seeing a 30pc drop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Can these tech stocks recover in early 2019? Probably, though it surely depends on the same mix of macro-economic factors as ever.</p><p>Some analysts argue that the markets have simply been on too much of a bull run and will naturally ease back for a period. Others say that tech stocks can be the exception because they still have bigger disruptive potential than many traditional equities. An example, they say, is Amazon - as big as it is, it could still get way larger thanks to the generally-accepted factor of online shopping still not being at a mature stage yet.</p><p>On the other hand, 2019 could also be a year of unprecedented regulatory activism against the biggest tech stocks. Tech companies, in the eyes of many, are simply getting too big and powerful. The so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) now wield more control over critical areas of our lives than any other cabal of firms before.</p><p>This draws more scrutiny and a regular serving of outrage. It's not just Facebook that gets slammed in the press and by parliaments; Google and Amazon are seeing increasing hostility too. To this end, 2018 saw what was arguably the most impactful piece of regulation aimed at big internet firms - the GDPR privacy law. However, this mainly only has legal effect in the EU, even if the top tech firms are implementing some of its principles across their global operations. This could mean that GDPR-style regulatory action may officially extend to other major markets, which would be a threat to some of the biggest tech firms.</p><p>2 THE TOXIC COMBINATION OF POLITICS AND INTERNET FIRMS This was the year when tech and politics became embroiled in ways that created problems for both sectors. Most attention fell on Facebook for a series of controversial political interventions carried out on its platform.</p><p>The biggest single incident was the Cambridge Analytica scandal. There, a British-owned political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica, sought to influence the 2016 US presidential election by mining the personal information of up to 50 million people in the US. The incident, first reported by The Observer, Guardian and Channel 4 News, led to Facebook coming under fire for not having stringent-enough controls over its platform.</p><p>Other Facebook-related political controversy permeated the year, with the platform constantly criticised for allowing malevolent actors to undermine elections and foment civic discourse.</p><p>In Ireland, tech firms' political importance came to the fore when some of the biggest internet firms took an unprecedented decision not to allow campaigning ads in the weeks preceding the country's abortion referendum in May.</p><p>Google went furthest, blocking all ads on its search engine and on YouTube relating to the Eighth Amendment referendum. Twitter did the same. On the same issue, Facebook announced that it was blocking all ads related to the Eighth Amendment referendum that came from advertisers outside the jurisdiction.</p><p>However, it still allowed referendum-related ads that were paid for by organisations within Ireland.</p><p>The social networking firm said that it would implement the same rule for future elections in Ireland, disallowing any ads that do not come from registered entities in Ireland, Google has not yet said what it intends to do in the area of political ads here in future.</p><p>3 WHEN CHINESE TECH FIRMS RAN INTO POLITICAL TROUBLE Huawei is now Ireland's third-largest smartphone manufacturer and second in the world after Samsung.</p><p>But 2018 was the year when it started to run into serious hurdles for political reasons, with 2019 promising more of the same.</p><p>Three countries - the US, Australia and New Zealand - hardened policies that militate against using Chinese tech infrastructure or devices.</p><p>The reason, they say, is that Huawei has close links to Chinese authorities. And as the US seems to be escalating its cyberwar with China, it has decreed that some Chinese companies can't be used.</p><p>Huawei comes in for particular atttention because it's such a big player in communications network infrastructure. It now has 28pc of the world's networking market, overtaking Ericsson and Nokia to become the biggest company.</p><p>This means it is to the fore in the new generations of 5G mobile networks and core broadband infrastructure.</p><p>But it could get worse for Huawei. US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to bar US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Chinese tech firms, including Huawei and ZTE.</p><p>Will this spread to Europe? Earlier this month, Britain's biggest telecoms operator was reported to be scaling back its use of Huawei equipment for security reasons.</p><p>British Telecom will now move Huawei kit away from \"core\" network functions in rolling out 5G infrastructure, the Financial Times reported.</p><p>Is this strategic decision from a big British company that is only limited to mobile networks? Or is it a general sea change in policy? Here, BT Ireland uses Huawei as its \"core\" high-speed network between Dublin and Belfast.</p><p>It recently bragged about increasing the speed and power of its underlying telecoms infrastructure between London and Dublin using Huawei's technology.</p><p>But those investment decisions were taken a few years ago, before tension around Huawei's ascension rose.</p><p>In early December, matters escalated further when Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested and detained by police in Canada.</p><p>The Canadians were acting on a US extradition warrant. The apparent grounds for detention relate to contravening trade sanctions against Iran, which the Trump administration is pursuing almost single-handedly.</p><p>The Chinese government was outraged by the detention, interpreting it as a direct assault on Chinese interests.</p><p>4 THE NATIONAL BROADBAND PLAN: SO CLOSE, SO FAR AWAY In 2018, the government's long-suffering rural broadband rollout plan made some progress before running into controversy.</p><p>A series of previously undisclosed meetings between the Communications Minister Denis Naughten, below, and the head of the tendering consortium, David McCourt, led to Mr Naughten's resignation from the Government.</p><p>Despite insisting that the assessment process of the bid continued throughout, the Government failed to come to a conclusion before the end of December on whether it would proceed with the Granahan-McCourt bid.</p><p>Commenting publicly on the matter this month, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that a decision on the issue may not be made until February.</p><p>This might dash hopes for connections to rural homes by the end of 2019, something that had been on the cards until the controversy around Mr Naughten's meetings blew up at the tail end of 2018.</p><p>However, the contract decision remains one of the biggest calls that this government will make in 2019.</p><p>If the State prefers to go back to the drawing board, it will likely be several years until non-urban Ireland gets the kind of basic internet infrastructure that currently enables city economies. Outside the National Broadband Plan, 2019 will see some modest improvement in the availability of broadband in Ireland.</p><p>At the very least, the last 100,000 of the 330,000 rural fibre-to-the-home connections being built by Eir will be completed by June.</p><p>These are connections into areas that have never had any form of decent broadband availability, so it's a net gain for the country.</p><p>However, it still leaves 540,000 homes and businesses - mostly in rural areas - without a proper connection.</p><p>The broadband contract decision remains one of the biggest calls that the State will make in 2019  ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Huawei row: A TV image of Huawei Technologies' CFO Meng Wanzhou as she exits the court registry following a bail hearing at British Columbia Superior Courts in VancouverUnder fire: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced scrutiny in Washington.

The recent news of a data breach affecting millions of users had activated the press' cynicism about Facebook \u2014 which is never far from the surface even on a good day \u2014 and so Portal's reception was defined almost entirely by its potential for privacy violations. On Tuesday, before Portal could even materialize in stores, privacy issues once again came to the fore. The issue is Facebook's system for collecting data for advertising purposes. When first writing about Portal,Recode's Kurt Wagner wrote: 'No data collected through Portal \u2014 even call log data or app usage data, like the fact that you listened to Spotify \u2014 will be used to target users with ads on Facebook. </p><p>Wagner was told that by the Facebook executives demonstrating Portal for him. But in a follow-up report,Wagner reported that those executives had unwittingly misled him: The conclusion is inescapable, and would seemingly bode ill for Facebook's home hardware line: Even when the company appears to be going out of its way to collect less data about you than usual, making a show of how the device is 'private by design, its own spokespeople can still struggle to articulate exactly what they are collecting, and how it might be used. Incidentally, at least with respect to Portal's use of Messenger infrastructure, I'm willing to bet the Portal team didn't even know until recently that call data could be used to target ads at Facebook users. It's entirely possible that the contours of the company's data-collection operation are broader than most employees can even keep in their heads at any given time. All of which might give you some pause before you pre-order your Portal. In any case, Tuesday was an inopportune time for Facebook to announce even more plans for the living room, butAlex Heath did it for them anyway. He revealed the existence of a project codenamed Ripley: a camera that you plug into your TV to turn it into a big Portal: The world's largest social network is building a camera-equipped device that sits atop a TV and allows video calling along with entertainment services like Facebook's YouTube competitor, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, internally codenamed 'Ripley, uses the same core technology as Facebook'srecently announced Portal video chat devicefor the home. Portal begins shipping next month and uses A.I. to automatically detect and follow people as they move throughout the frame during a video call. Like Portal before it, Ripley represents a logical extension of Facebook's bid to insert a social graph and camera into all of the screens in your life. And also like Portal, it drew mostly exasperated tweets. You can get people to hate-read a story, but you can't get them to hate-buy a video phone. Facebook's case that Portal is 'private by design has fallen apart before it even shipped, and consumers who were on the fence about buying one may just have fallen off for good. Democracy What Is NPC, the Pro-Trump Internet's New Favorite Insult? Kevin Roose reports on a new influence operation found on Twitter, born of 4Chan, that takes the common video-game idea of a 'nonplayable character and turns it into an insult against liberals: Last week, a trolling campaign organized by right-wing internet users spilled over onto Twitter. The campaign, which was born in the fever swamps of 4chan and Reddit message boards, involved creating hundreds of fictional personas with gray cartoon avatars, known as NPCs. These accounts posed as liberal activists and were used to spread \u2014 among other things \u2014 false information about November's midterm elections. Over the weekend, Twitter responded by suspending about 1,500 accounts associated with the NPC trolling campaign. The accounts violated Twitter's rules against 'intentionally misleading election-related content, according to a person familiar with the company's enforcement process. The person, who would speak only anonymously, was not authorized to discuss the decision. Google's CEO Says Tests of Censored Chinese Search Engine Turned Out Great After the newsletter went out yesterday, Google's CEO took the stage to speak about Project Dragonfly in the most detail he has offered to date. He promoted the idea that Google will benefit the average Chinese citizen. TGIF should be interesting this week. Nitasha Tiku has the relevant quotes: 'It turns out we'll be able to serve well over 99 percent of the queries, that users request. What's more, 'There are many, many areas where we would provide information better than what's available, such as searching for cancer treatments, Pichai said. 'Today people either get fake cancer treatments or they actually get useful information. Facebook cracks down on \u2018dark ads' by British political groups Facebook's political ads database, now live in the United States and Canada, is coming next to the United Kingdom. But there are important differences, Alex Hern and Jim Waterston report: Unlike in the US, where the political transparency features were launched this year, the British iteration will not require adverts on political issues to be labelled and registered. Instead, the company is taking a narrow view, requiring registration for ads 'that reference political figures, political parties, elections, legislation before Parliament and past referenda that are the subject of national debate. This means that while adverts on topics such as Brexit will be made public in the ad archive, promotions on general topics such as immigration will not be covered. I'm an Amazon Employee. My Company Shouldn't Sell Facial Recognition Tech to Police. A day after Medium published an open letter from Microsoft employees asking the company not to pursue a $10 billion Pentagon cloud-computing contract, an anonymous Amazon employee takes to Medium to criticize the company for selling facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies: A couple weeks ago, my co-workers delivered a letter to this effect, signed by over 450 employees, to Jeff Bezos and other executives. The letter also contained demands to kick Palantir, the software firm that powers much of ICE's deportation and tracking program, off Amazon Web Services and to institute employee oversight for ethical decisions. We know Bezos is aware of these concerns and the industry-wide conversation happening right now.On stage, he acknowledged that big tech's products might be misused, even exploited, by autocrats. But rather than meaningfully explain how Amazon will act to prevent the bad uses of its own technology, Bezos suggested we wait for society's 'immune response. If Amazon waits, we think the harm will be difficult to undo. Facebook hack affected 3 million in Europe, first big test for GDPR The September Facebook breach affected 3 million European citizens, the Irish Data Protection Commission said Tuesday. Salvador Rodriguez \u2014 fun fact, my old roommate! \u2014 reports: This security breach is expected to be the first major test of Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation, and the number of European users affected could help determine the severity of any penalties against the company. Under GDPR, companies handling the personal data of Europeans must adhere to strict requirements for holding and securing that information, and must report breaches to authorities within 72 hours. Under the regulation, companies can face fines of up to 4 percent of their annual global revenue. For Facebook, which made more than $40.65 billion in revenue in 2017, that fine could be as much as $1.63 billion. Expanding Our Policies on Voter Suppression Jessica Leinwand clarifies recent changes that Facebook make to its policies around removing misinformation related to elections: We already prohibit offers to buy or sell votes as well as misrepresentations about the dates, locations, times and qualifications for casting a ballot. We have been removing this type of content since 2016. Last month, we extended this policy further and are now banning misrepresentations about how to vote, such as claims that you can vote by text message, and statements about whether a vote will be counted. (e.g. 'If you voted in the primary, your vote in the general election won't count.) We've also recently introduced a new reporting option on Facebook so that people can let us know if they see voting information that may be incorrect, and have set up dedicated reporting channels for state election authorities so that they can do the same. The alt-right loves YouTube Zack Beauchamp takes a look at two studies: one, fromBellingcat, which I included in yesterday's newsletter; and a second, from a European researcher, that attempted to take a 'census of right-wing extremists on Twitter. Both point to YouTube as a powerful force for radicalization: In short, these recent reports make it clear that YouTube's design has made it a powerful tool for far-right recruiting. There's a tremendous library of far-right content on the site, as one might expect on a largely unregulated video uploading service, and the alt-right spends significant effort spreading these videos on alternate platforms. What's more, the videos appear to be effective at radicalizing people. A not-insignificant number of people exposed to these videos, either via YouTube's algorithm or a link on another platform, finds them persuasive \u2014 and end up joining the alt-right or other far-right movements as a result. Elsewhere Black Man's Fatal Encounter With Police Strikes Close to Home in Silicon Valley Here is a heartbreaking story about Chinedu Valentine Okobi, an unarmed 36-year-old man who got into a struggle with police officers on October 3rd in the Bay Area. He died after being hit with a stun gun. His sister, Ebele Okobi, is Facebook's public policy director for Africa. Company executives have stepped forward to share Okobi's story and bring renewed attention to the the problem of police brutality: In the wake of her brother's killing, every senior leader at the company, including Mark Zuckerberg, has reached out to her to show support, she said. Current and former Facebook colleagues have used their connections to help spread her brother's story among activists and the news media. Several Facebook executives are expected to attend Mr. Okobi's memorial service.A memorial fundto make donations to the Equal Justice Initiative in his honor has been set up on Facebook. Facebook's big bet on telecom gear Ina Fried catches us up on Facebooks' Telecom Infra Project, which Facebook helps the telecom industry build networks at a lower cost, in the hopes that it will bring more Facebook users onto the internet: At its TIP summit in London, Facebook announced Terragraph trials have started with its partners in Hungary, Malaysia and Indonesia. Terragraph uses the same components as a high-speed, high-frequency wireless protocol known as WiGig to deliver gigabit speeds to dense underserved urban areas at a fraction of the cost of fiber. Facebook's former security chief warns of tech's \u2018negative impacts' \u2014 and has a plan to help solve them Alex Stamos \u2014 whose Twitter account has gotten really good lately! \u2014 is launching an 'institute at Stanford University to bring techies, Washington policy types, and academics closer together. Craig Timberg and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: 'There aren't processes to thoughtfully think through these trade-offs, he said in an interview ahead of his talk at the university's Center for International Security and Cooperation. 'You end up with these for-profit, very powerful organizations that are not democratically accountable, making decisions that are in their best and often short-term interest hellip; without there being a much more open and democratic discussion of what these issues are. He hopes the new initiative, called the Stanford Internet Observatory, will help unite 'sometimes warring factions of academia, tech companies and Washington policymakers to work together to help solve 'the negative impacts technology can have on society, he said. Advertisers Allege Facebook Failed to Disclose Key Metric Error for More Than a Year Facebook knew about issues with how it measured viewership of video ads for more than a year before it told advertisers in 2016, according to a new lawsuit. Instagram Has a Massive Harassment Problem Last week Taylor Lorenz told us thatteens are being bullied constantly on Instagram. Now she has talked to some people who work at Instagram about what they're seeing: 'There's an effort called \u2018kindness,' which is to reduce bullying and harassment, but there's not that many people working on it, said Alex, a current Instagram employee who asked to be referred to by a gender-neutral pseudonym. 'Generally, what you'll find is a lot of these efforts on harassment or bullying, or there's a new feature to track how much time you spend\u2014they're mostly done for PR. Another Instagram employee told me nearly the same thing: that Instagram's anti-bullying rhetoric 'doesn't seem connected to what's actually going on in the company. What's Next for Instagram's Kevin Systrom? Flying Lessons Speaking of Instagram \u2014 if, like me, you're obsessed with why the founders quit last month, you can now watch Kevin Systrom's interview with Lauren Goode and analyze his body language and intonation for yourself. Twitter spammed people's phones with cryptic notifications Hey, I wrote this! (The reason turned out to have something to do with 'invisible notifications sent to trigger badge icons.) Twitter, theBluth Companyof Silicon Valley social networks, kicked off Tuesday by sending users incomprehensible text strings via push notifications. A wide range of Twitter users tweeted their notifications, which consisted of long strings of numbers and lowercase letters, followed by a colon and another number. Maybe it's a random burst of data. Maybe Twitterhas revealed the nuclear launch codes! Either way, it should be a fun afternoon. Breaking WeChat's Grip on China's Social Networks ($) Would you believe that there's more competition among social networks in an authoritarian dictatorship than there is here in our capitalist paradise? Well there is! Juro Osawa and Yunan Zhang report: Imagine if Facebook's key lieutenants quit to launch a rival product. In China, something like that just happened. Two of the people who helped develop WeChat, the nearly universal chat app run by Tencent, recently created new social networks called Pop and Echo. It comes amid signs WeChat's grip over social networking and media consumption in China may not be as total as it once was, leaving openings for newcomers and potentially a more fragmented market. While the new contenders are young, the amount of backing they are getting shows investors believe new social apps more narrowly focused on photo- and video-sharing, where WeChat is less dominant, could pay off. How Short Video Created the World's Most Valuable Startup Peter Yang investigates why Chinese short-form video Douyin succeeded where Vine failed. I don't think this is a complete explanation, but worth considering, at least: Music as the inspiration:The vast majority of short videos on Douyin have a 515s music clip playing in the background. The song defines what creators do in the video and creators can click a song to see other videos and get inspired to create similar content. Create trends and copy them: Similarly, viewers can browse Douyin's discover tab to see a frequent rotation of trending hashtags and contests to get inspired to create content. The Douyin team actively curates new trends in partnership with its top creators. Donald Daters, a dating app for Trump supporters, leaked its users' data People who only want to date Trump supporters have enough problems in their life. And now this, from Zack Whittaker: On its launch day alone, the app had a little over 1,600 users and counting. We know because a security researcher found issues with the app that made it possible to download the entire user database. Launches Pinterest is turning more of its window shoppers into buyers with newest features Kate Clark has an update on what Pinterest is doing with its money-making shoppable pins: The three new features include up-to-date pricing and stock information on all product pins, with links that take pinners to the retailer's website, plus a new 'Products like this category under each fashion and home decor pin, which includes stylistically similar products that Pinterest thinks that user will like. It's also added a new shopping shortcut within the app that connects users to similar products to a given pin. That new feature is accessible when users hold down on any home or style pin and click on the price tag logo (second image below). Takes Here's a take from a former Google engineer who was once asked to participate in a company project related to censorship in China.

The proposed digital currency, which has yet to meet regulatory approvals, is set to launch sometime next year.Announcement of the social network's forays into the digital asset space has since raised serious concerns among lawmakers. Congress in July drafted a bill, titled Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prohibit large platform utilitiesdefined as a tech company that earns annual global revenues of $25 billion or morefrom being a financial institution or operating a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) in June called for a moratorium and Congressional review of Facebook's Libra project, given the company's troubled past. </p><p>Appearing in July on CNBC's Closing Bell, Waters likened Facebook's cryptocurrency venture to starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it.Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in July posited that Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.President Trump raised concerns about Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency as well, tweeting in July that if Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks.FS Vector, which was founded in 2018, bills itself as a regulatory compliance, public policy and business strategy advisory firm that specializes in the fintech cryptocurrency, blockchain and financial services markets.FS Vector partner John Collins leads the Facebook account. Collins formerly served as vice president of international policy at the American Bankers Association's international subsidiary, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade. Prior to that, he was a staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and also led Congress' first work into digital currencies in 2013.

Facebook added that \"the matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\"</p><p>Facebook has been in negotiations with the regulator for months over a financial penalty for claims that the company violated a 2011 privacy consent decree. That year, the social network promised a series of measures to protect its users' privacy after an investigation found that its handling of data had harmed consumers.</p><p>The FTC opened a new investigation last year after Facebook came under fire again. This time, the company was accused of not protecting its users' data from being harvested without their consent by Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm that was building voter profiles for the Trump campaign. Facebook also suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.</p><p>Levying a sizable fine on Facebook would go against the reputation of the United States not restraining the power of big tech companies. For years, American regulators have faced criticism that they allowed Silicon Valley firms to grow unchecked, even as their European counterparts aggressively brought actions against tech companies - including fining Google a record $5.1 billion last year for abusing its power in the mobile phone market. </p><p>For the Trump administration, penalizing Facebook would be a defining action. Although President Donald Trump has rolled back scores of business regulations, he and others in Washington - including Democrats - have coalesced around calling for greater scrutiny and enforcement of tech companies.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a presidential candidate, has called for the breakup of Amazon, Google and Facebook. And Trump has sounded alarms over the dominance of the firms and their control over speech and the distribution of information. </p><p>It would also be a milestone for the FTC, whose biggest fine for a tech company was $22 million against Google in 2012 for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. The agency, which is charged with overseeing deceptive and unfair business practices, is riding a wave of anti-tech sentiment as questions about how tech companies have contributed to misinformation, election meddling and data privacy problems have stacked up.</p><p>\"The FTC is really limited in what they can actually do in enforcing a consent decree, but in the case of Facebook, they had public pressure on their side,\" said Justin Brookman, a former official for the regulator who is now a director of privacy at Consumers Union, nonprofit consumer advocacy group.</p><p>But some lawmakers said a fine would not suffice in punishing Facebook. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said that \"a fine in the low billions of dollars would amount to a slap on the wrist for Facebook\" and that Congress needed to act.</p><p>\"Facebook must be held accountable - not just by fines - but also far reaching reforms in management, privacy practices and culture,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., added in a tweet.</p><p>The FTC declined to comment.</p><p>Officials at the agency have not reached a final decision on Facebook, said two people with knowledge of the situation, who were not authorized to speak publicly. In recent weeks, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, sent strict orders to all commission offices and staff in the consumer protection, enforcement and privacy bureaus to not discuss the Facebook case, two people said.</p><p>But Facebook's estimate of a fine signaled that a settlement with the FTC was near. The Securities and Exchange Commission typically requires that a company notify investors of any significant financial hits.</p><p>For Facebook, a $5 billion fine would amount to a fraction of its $56 billion in annual revenue. Any resolution would also alleviate some of the regulatory pressure that has been intensifying against the company over the past few years.</p><p>\"This would be a joke of a fine - a two-weeks-of-revenue, parking-ticket-level penalty for destroying democracy,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that is a vocal critic of the power of tech companies.</p><p>More meaningful to Facebook would be any regulatory mandates that curbed its ability to share data with business partners or required it to take more measures to inform consumers when and how it collected data.</p><p>\"Those will have the most lasting impact on consumers' privacy,\" said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technology officer for the FTC.</p><p>Even as the negotiations continue, Facebook's business remains robust. The company said Wednesday that its revenue increased 26 percent in the first quarter to $15 billion from a year earlier. Net income dropped 51 percent from a year ago to $2.4 billion because of the expected one-time charge related to the FTC investigation. The company has more than $40 billion in cash reserves. </p><p>New users continue flocking to Facebook. More than 2.7 billion people use one of the company's so-called family of apps - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - each month. The company said about 1.56 billion people use Facebook every day, up 8 percent from a year ago.</p><p>Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, said he planned to start shifting people toward private conversations and away from public broadcasting on social media, which is likely to help the company manage issues of toxic content and misinformation. On Wednesday in a conference call, Zuckerberg repeated that vision.</p><p>\"People want a platform that is as strong on privacy as possible,\" Zuckerberg said. He added that \"we just don't know\" how the change would affect the company's business.</p><p>Zuckerberg also said he welcomed regulations, an idea that he has increasingly been vocal about this year.</p><p>\"I think it's necessary,\" he said. \"Getting these issues right is more important than our interests. And I believe that regulation will help establish trust when people know that the right systems of governance and accountability are in place.\"</p><p>Isaac and Kang write</p><p> for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0094087388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYS-BD71-JBM5-R3M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook said the FTC had told it in June of the antitrust probe.Shares of Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, fell 1% after hours to $202.50 after initially rising on its quarterly results. The shares have recouped most of the losses sparked a year ago on concerns of slowing usage and the costs of improving privacy, which had spurred the biggest ever one-day drop in Facebook shares.A 'significant investment'On Wednesday, Facebook's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, told analysts that the FTC settlement would require 'significant investment' in people and technology. </p><p>He said ad revenue would be affected by new privacy laws rolling out globally, changes in privacy rules by the operating systems on which Facebook relies, and the company's tweaking of its own services.Facebook has increased the number and variety of ads, which are the foundation of its business, as users gravitate toward private and interactive features such as Stories. It has responded to political and regulatory pressure by expanding programs and promises related to securing data and policing objectionable content.The initiatives remain a drag on earnings, but the company's wealth of information on its users remains valuable to advertisers.Facebook, which had set aside $3 billion in the first quarter to cover a regulatory settlement, said it took a $2 billion charge in the second quarter to account for the remainder of the $5 billion settlement with the FTC. The settlement is still subject to court approval.Facebook also acknowledged in a statement the U.S. Justice Department's announcement Tuesday of an 'antitrust review of market-leading online platforms.'Steady user numbersFor the second quarter, Facebook reported 2.7 billion monthly users and 2.1 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both figures about the same as last quarter.Quarterly revenue rose to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion a year ago, beating analysts' average estimate of $16.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.'News regarding FTC and data privacy, along with antitrust investigations and additional headline risks likely to continue to hang over the stock, but it looks like the platform still remains a very popular destination for the users,' Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in an email to Reuters.US investigationsFacebook has faced questions for the past three years from regulators and users worldwide over how a service designed to share news and events with friends and family has become a platform for spreading misinformation about politics, health and other subjects. A series of data breaches has prompted investigations in several countries.The U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday that it would examine complaints that some 'search, social media, and some retail services online' are engaging in anti-competitive practices, an apparent reference to big tech companies including Facebook.The FTC inquiry that was settled Wednesday stemmed from allegations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. A Netflix documentary about the scandal, 'The Great Hack,' premiered Wednesday.The fine, which some lawmakers have called 'a slap on the wrist,' cut second-quarter profit to $2.6 billion, compared with $5.1 billion, a year earlier.Excluding the fine and a $1.1 billion one-time tax expense, earnings would have been $1.99 per share, Facebook said.The tax expense stemmed from a court ruling, in which the company was not involved, that it said required accounting changes for stock-based compensation.Costs jumped 66% compared to a year ago, to nearly $12.3 billion, as Facebook continues to ramp up spending to improve content and security across its platforms.Facebook has said it expects expenses and revenue growth to come back closer to even but several hurdles remain.In emerging markets such as India, revenue is lagging behind Facebook's number of users. Efforts to enter new businesses, such as recently announced plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra as part of a move into digital payments, have faced pushback from lawmakers and regulators.Meanwhile, the company is developing additional hardware products, which can be more costly to build than apps.There were bright spots in the second-quarter results. For instance, revenue from Europe accelerated for the first time in several quarters, growing 24% compared to 20% last quarter. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121564016926199251762100096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-CC31-JB5Y-N0GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><timeReceived>1:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Well, with notices about to be sent notifying over 600,000 Canadian Facebook users that their personal information had been collected and used by Cambridge Analytica, we thought it was time for a timely reminder by Canada's privacy commissioner to discuss your privacy and more. Daniel Therrien joins me in the studio. Commissioner, you're investigating Facebook, but we do have a direct connection here in Canada. This AggregateIQ outfit in BC has been pointed to by the whistleblower as having a link in this political meddling in the use of information, personal information for political purposes. Why isn't it being investigated?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANIEL THERRIEN (Privacy Commissioner): Well, actually, we have decided today to start an investigation with our colleagues in British Columbia, my colleague, the privacy commissioner of British Columbia. So we are starting an investigation jointly into both Facebook and AggregateIQ. AggregateIQ is a Victoria, BC, company, a data analytics company. I need to be careful about the facts because we're investigating so I won't prejudge the facts. But the allegations are that the information of many people, including 600,000 Canadians on Facebook, may have been used by Cambridge Analytica in the UK, and potentially by AggregateIQ in British Columbia ultimately to give advice to political parties.</p><p>MARTIN: Wow. I'm trying to, I know you don't want to talk specifically about the Facebook investigation, but how far are you willing to go with that? Could you call Zuckerberg to talk to him about it, or investigate to that level these privacy breaches, or what are you looking for investigating not only Facebook but now AggregateIQ?</p><p>THERRIEN: We have powers to compel people to testify and to give us information, but if we have information, as we think we will from Facebook representatives in Canada, that should suffice. What we will investigate is at the very general level of whether the privacy act was complied with. I think one of the issues that is highlighted by the allegations here is the concern that information that was obtained by Facebook was then used by others potentially based on fairly permissive consent rules that perhaps was responsible for the information to then go to other companies, the data analytics company. This question of consent, whether people provide meaningful consent, whether Canada's laws are sufficiently robust to ensure that consent is robust, is an important issue here, and I think what we're seeing with the facts, or at least the allegations of this case, is you have somebody like Tim Cook, for instance, a competitor to some extent to Facebook, but the CEO of obviously of a big tech giant saying that the time of self-regulation is probably over. So when you have the CEO of a very major tech company coming to that view, saying that the situation is dire in his view, and calls for regulation, I think that that certainly highlights the need for many countries, including Canada, to strengthen its laws.</p><p>MARTIN: Yeah, I mean, so you think it's an alarm bell sounding that the government is going to have to respond.</p><p>THERRIEN: I think so. I think so. It's certainly a wake-up call for the population and hopefully for the government.</p><p>MARTIN: There have been some steps. Facebook, one, is saying they're going to make it far more obvious you have to give consent. Is that a promising step forward in your view? Notwithstanding that you haven't finished your investigation.</p><p>THERRIEN: It's a good thing. But Facebook has made similar promises in the past. I think really it's important that companies be accountable, and changes like this by a company like Facebook is a sign of accountability, but I think that what we're now seeing in 2018 after several years of new technology and the internet is that accountability by companies is not sufficient.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p>Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p>Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p>MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p>FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p>FORBES: Worries --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p>MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p>FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p>ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p>So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p>BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p>ROLLINS: There's -</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p>ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p>FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p>ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p>ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p>FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p>ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: How do you -</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p>BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p>ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p>FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p>BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p>ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p>ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p>BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p>ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p>BELL: It's not your money. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p>ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p>FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p>FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p>CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p>British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p>And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p>CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p>KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p>Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p>So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p>FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p>FORBES: They know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p>The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p>Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p>Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p>New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p>Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p>FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p>In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p>YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p>And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p>Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p>BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p>So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p>YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p>But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p>FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p>FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p>YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p>FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p>YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p>MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p>YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p>FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p>YORK: Well --</p><p>FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p>FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p>FORBES: Exactly.</p><p>YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p>BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p>YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Her visit is expected to last four  days. Well, the Saudi Arabian stock market is joining FTSE Russell's  emerging market index. That's going to start March of next year. The move  is expected to draw billions of dollars of foreign portfolio investment  into the country. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister was on the show earlier  this week, talking about the country's reforms launched by the crown prince  Mohammed Bin Salman. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, FINANCE MINISTER, SAUDI ARABIA: We are at the stage  where we moved from planning over the past two years to execution. So there  is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of  June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.  Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi  Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the  movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo  Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef 'O'  Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that  also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p>Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for  the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb  recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super  fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to  find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they  did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel,  the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares  of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right,  I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it  for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise. </p><p>BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle. </p><p>FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie  star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with  Mel Gibson. We've got the details right after this. </p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well move over Michael Jordan, here comes Lebron.  Jared has the story right now. Hey Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. More folks saying  \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has  played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p>Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his  point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p>Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning,  before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever,  March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this  week. Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it gives us an opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP) </p><p>MAX: Yes, alll 30 MLB teams were scheduled to play today, but the Reds game  in Cincinnati against the Nationals postponed because of a rainy forecast.  They'll make it up tomorrow, first game 12:40 in Miami between the Cubs and  the Marlins. </p><p>History will be made in the NFL next season, the L.A. Rams are going to  have two male cheerleaders. While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore  Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton  Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of  the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p>Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves.  Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p>MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p>MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio. By the way, Gronk, I get to tell my one Gronk story. I saw him  wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once. </p><p>MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack. </p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big  screen. </p><p>MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts --  tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still  pretty good -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p>MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p>FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in  2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\"  everyone laughed. Now they're best buddies. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow interesting, Jared, thank you. Jared Max, catch the sports  sports reports and Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius XM115. Still ahead, we  head to outer space. That's next. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody  thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March   29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for  technology, shares of  several big tech companies under pressure yesterday,  and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet,  Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of  a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns  weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the  month and the quarter and today.</p><p> Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow  Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10  points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's  two thirds of one percent. </p><p> In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100,  TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green  across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in  China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p> Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to  fulfill a campaign promise. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our  infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way  behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then  a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and  15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination  between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department,  and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all  in on it. The shocking revelations coming up. </p><p> Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are  breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been  partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim  Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the  president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p> And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples  are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All  those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox  Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former  Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great  to see you.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to  be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware  for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once  earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all  off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of  corporate America. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in  the first quarter, right? </p><p> MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking  about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not  just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies.  We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just  yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this,  fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88  cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate.  Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production  rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is  another canary that we need to watch. </p><p> BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right. </p><p> FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p> FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit. </p><p> BARTIROMO: The trade war worries? </p><p> FORBES: Worries --</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section,  Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the  bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries. </p><p> MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell  you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all  in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed. </p><p> BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good  job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're  seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are  fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on  the president's part, don't they? </p><p> FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but  not much change.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to  talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this,  President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5  trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as  his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers  concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of  the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about  rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address  back in January. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of  builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a  disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved  for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together  to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy  needs and our people deserve. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that  Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over  the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman,  former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor  -</p><p> ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the  president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the  money come from for this infrastructure plan? </p><p> ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private  investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this  would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we  would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're  going to have much after the big budget bill. </p><p> So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think  we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal  government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills  (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local  communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the  federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private  investment in there is going to be very important. </p><p> BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and  then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector. </p><p> MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new  infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president  acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's  --</p><p> ROLLINS: There's -</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there. </p><p> ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington  was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of  transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want.  My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the  president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going  to get done until at least January or February of next year. </p><p> FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the  transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers,  permit barriers? </p><p> ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: That's the big issue. </p><p> ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this  administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her  in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this  stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a  fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition  because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats  should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I  think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage  type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive  bill. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to  my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it  hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular  income taxpayers to pay for this?  We're going to borrow it? Again, there's  no financial responsibility in Washington. </p><p> ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the  Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992. </p><p> FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway  spending. </p><p> ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big - </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BELL: How do you -</p><p> ROLLINS: Go ahead. </p><p> BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to  them to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead,  Ed.</p><p> ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see  that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate  and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that  piece of it's not done yet. </p><p> BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think  they won't get a return for 13 years. </p><p> ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think - </p><p> BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the  regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get  the investment, don't you think, Ed? </p><p> ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it  should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one.  And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p> FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having  toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads? </p><p> ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a  frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is  just not possible. </p><p> FORBES: Free potholes. </p><p> BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the  things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne  Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p> ROLLINS: Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's  when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've  got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs  Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump  Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to  replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be  fired just this month. </p><p> ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the  unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning.  He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government  regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant  decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249  pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to  be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this  point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the  president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present  secretary had the ear. </p><p> MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement  of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always  more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is  actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations  people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were  always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad  choice but this guy stinks, he's gone. </p><p> ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an  administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and  regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go  fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p> BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p> ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health  Secretary.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely  right. </p><p> ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White  House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd  say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by  them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was  our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules,  you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're  going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all  the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse  taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust. </p><p> BELL: It's not your money. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming  President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be  the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says  #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people  like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take  on this? </p><p> ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star  20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long,  long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And  this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being  vicious. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it. </p><p> FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up  actors would go -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO: You're right. </p><p> FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p> MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the  famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the  ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line. </p><p> ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75,  I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam  somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for  this.</p><p> BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p> ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell.  Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama  Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic  leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage  coming up.  And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you  see what this says</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final  day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses  concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the  start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also  higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting  many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock  markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl? </p><p> CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys  you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly  all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now  sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in  correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns  of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's  misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he  might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good,  because the stocks have been hit this month.  Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are  saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get  together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have  actually had since 1999.  Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13%  so far this year. </p><p> British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into  contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are  now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also  searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London  of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic  dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United  States. </p><p> And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce  from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot  more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples  have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some  uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds.   So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people  surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep  issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time. </p><p> CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that,  buddy, see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE: You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says  some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as  Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for  regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to  a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the  action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back  in a moment</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not  going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of  privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil  liberty.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's  commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology  community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now  sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called  to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph).  Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people  scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we  do? </p><p> KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about  it also, and  how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this  morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay  out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with  your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your  privacy. Number one, you can turn off  the ability for apps to have access  to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply  remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own  settings and I saw 74 apps,  about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and  they have it. </p><p> Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or  another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And  then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you  log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just  log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very  clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our  personal data. </p><p> So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location  privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread  crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends  to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends  allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria,  they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and  give it to a third party app. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day,  looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You  have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps,  right, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy  settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again,  it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years  Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just  down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary  school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app  developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on. </p><p> BARTIROMO: That is so wrong. </p><p> MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your  profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk  over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well  as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's  not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at  the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one  after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to  personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show  face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you  see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new  direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think  he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I  think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for  our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and  to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p> BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere. </p><p> FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can  he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing? </p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up.  There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his  part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's  on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's  kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different  story. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p> MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she  has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than  actually running the company. </p><p> BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\" </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p> BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.  </p><p> BARTIROMO: By the way -- </p><p> MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's  not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need  to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p> FORBES: They know.</p><p> BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you. </p><p> KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's  got control. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new  Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they  were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and  Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's  White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia  Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the  top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But  which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria  Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories  right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this  morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up  9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month  and the final trading day of the quarter. </p><p> The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track  for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the  day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on  the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine  points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday. </p><p> Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices  this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this  morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will  see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a  quarter percent in China. </p><p> Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning  we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector  all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a  quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p> New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against  democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They  show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies,  President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee  Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to  say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They  continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is  opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top  matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with  customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually  love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this  morning. </p><p> Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a  luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle.  We've got the story coming  up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob  Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up,  but first this top story this half an hour. </p><p> FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional  investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page  strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama  Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and  the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation.  Is anyone surprised? </p><p> In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber  CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is  the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's  (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber  info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would  be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they  had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee  Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to  what was revealed last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear  like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the  foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and  target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the  Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to  see you. </p><p> BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to  say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\"  Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us? </p><p> YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say  and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them  from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to  find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the  allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did  knowledge of those allegations go? </p><p> And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its  TrumpRussia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of  2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking --  Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was  President Obama's Chief of Staff. </p><p> Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for  keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears  The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. </p><p> BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are  now officially under  investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of  course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector  General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI  officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court  to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign. </p><p> So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion  between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party  paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court.  They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump  campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually  still won. I mean, it is. </p><p> YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking  about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier.  If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the  Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did  they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher  Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on  this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and  finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p> But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this,  on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a  lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the  FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of  personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't  need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their  relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the  Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's  name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official  involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p> FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p> BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about  wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge  Contreras. Go ahead, Steve. </p><p> FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is  muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a  tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special  prosecutor?  Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure  justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the  next step? </p><p> YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the  release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's  not an investigation into the TrumpRussia investigation, but it is an  investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the  Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions  about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the  same time as James Comey's national book tour. </p><p> FORBES: Just a coincidence. </p><p> YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general  investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the  dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will  eventually come out but not for probably at least a year. </p><p> MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited  power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the  government like Andrew McCabe. </p><p> YORK: Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey. </p><p> MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on  this?   </p><p> YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special  Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate  people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no  longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was.  What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is  the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't  seen any indication right now that that's going to happen. </p><p> FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this? </p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically  to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it  results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I  mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is  because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on  what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can  prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do  that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the  initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with  the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the  investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of  nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump  out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade? </p><p> YORK: Well --</p><p> FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they  didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do. </p><p> BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can  go wherever he wants. </p><p> FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's  a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he  has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul  Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a  scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they  would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts,  none of which involved any collusion. </p><p> FORBES: Exactly.</p><p> YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going  to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is  investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President  Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be  charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it  would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments  we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political  argument of president Trump. </p><p> BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think  anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power? </p><p> YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on  Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I  don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out  what happened right now. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much. </p><p> YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's  baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the  diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to  Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing  the big screen with Mel Gibson.  We'll be back in a moment with that. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist  is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban  militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by  militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours  after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and  said she was excited to be back in her country. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many  (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having  to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Her visit is expected to last four  days. Well, the Saudi Arabian stock market is joining FTSE Russell's  emerging market index. That's going to start March of next year. The move  is expected to draw billions of dollars of foreign portfolio investment  into the country. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister was on the show earlier  this week, talking about the country's reforms launched by the crown prince  Mohammed Bin Salman. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, FINANCE MINISTER, SAUDI ARABIA: We are at the stage  where we moved from planning over the past two years to execution. So there  is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going. </p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of  June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.  Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi  Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the  movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo  Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef 'O'  Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that  also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p> Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for  the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb  recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super  fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to  find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they  did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel,  the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares  of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right,  I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it  for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise. </p><p> BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle. </p><p> FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p> CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p> FORBES: Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie  star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with  Mel Gibson. We've got the details right after this. </p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well move over Michael Jordan, here comes Lebron.  Jared has the story right now. Hey Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. More folks saying  \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has  played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p> Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his  point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866  consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA  record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that  Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points,  which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last  night, a (inaudible) record. </p><p> Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning,  before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever,  March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this  week. Take a listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p> ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it gives us an opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p> (END VIDEOCLIP) </p><p> MAX: Yes, alll 30 MLB teams were scheduled to play today, but the Reds game  in Cincinnati against the Nationals postponed because of a rainy forecast.  They'll make it up tomorrow, first game 12:40 in Miami between the Cubs and  the Marlins. </p><p> History will be made in the NFL next season, the L.A. Rams are going to  have two male cheerleaders. While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore  Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton  Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of  the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p> Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves.  Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to  make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an  upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is  titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too.  So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made  you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future  outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked  around. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie? </p><p> MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it. </p><p> MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p> BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p> MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Really? </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p> BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on  audio. By the way, Gronk, I get to tell my one Gronk story. I saw him  wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once. </p><p> MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack. </p><p> BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big  screen. </p><p> MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts --  tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still  pretty good -</p><p> MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p> MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p> FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in  2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\"  everyone laughed. Now they're best buddies. </p><p> BARTIROMO: Wow interesting, Jared, thank you. Jared Max, catch the sports  sports reports and Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius XM115. Still ahead, we  head to outer space. That's next. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday morning. Everybody thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories right now, 7 am on the east coast. Trouble for technology, shares of several big tech companies under pressure yesterday, and there's fears of a regulatory crack down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Facebook and Twitter are in bear market territory while Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix are in correction territory. The slide comes amid fears of a regulatory crack down following Facebook's personal data scandal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, the stocks are bouncing this morning we should tell you. The concerns weighed on the major average yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, all on pace for the worst March in nearly 20 years across (ph) the month and the quarter and today.</p><p>Futures this morning show a rally at the start of trading this morning, Dow Industrials up 70 points right now, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 10 points, at the third of a percent and the Nasdaq is up 40 points, that's two thirds of one percent.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher a across the board. Take a look, FT-100, TechCrunch (ph), DAX Index, all up this morning. In Asia overnight, green across the board there as well. Shanghai composite, the best performer in China, up one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated infrastructure plan. He's going to Ohio to do that today in an effort to fulfill a campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: We're going to make our infrastructure modernized, and we're really way behind schedule. We're way behind other countries. We also led the many way for many, many years. Then a number of decades ago it slowed down, and over the last eight years and 15 years, to be honest, it's come to a halt.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning. Collusion in the Capitol, newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department, and the Democratic Leadership over the Russia investigation. They were all in on it. The shocking revelations coming up.</p><p>Let's make a deal. Nissan reportedly in talks to merge with Renault. We are breaking down the deal for the two auto companies, which have been partnered side by side for some time now. And not funny, comedian Jim Carrey under fire again this morning after his latest painting targets the president's son. The outrage coming up this morning.</p><p>And then problems in the bedroom, why nearly one-third of married couples are ready to hit the snooze button on their sleeping arrangements. All those stories coming up this morning. Joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McdDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and the former Republican President Trump Candidate himself, Steve Forbes is here. CRFA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell as well. Good morning, everybody. Great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning, good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here on a day that we're ending the quarter, which is going to be a pretty good quarter for earnings, by the way.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CRFA: It's going to be a great aware for earnings, not so much for the performance of the stock market. But once earnings start being released, April 13th, JP Morgan really kicks it all off. We should see investors feel reassured about the fundamentals of corporate America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you're expecting 16.5% earnings growth in the S&amp;P 500 in the first quarter, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think one thing weighing on the market, and we were talking about this in the break, and we mentioned it in the last hour. It's not just Facebook and regulatory risk at some of these technology companies. We'll also look at Tesla. I think Tesla's stock fell more than 7.5% just yesterday. The unsecured bonds that mature in 2025, you mentioned this, fell to 86 cents on dollar. Although they recovered two cents of that 88 cents before ticking up to that. That is a real concern with the burn rate. Tesla was $1 billion a quarter recently. They're trying to get production rolling of the model 3. That's a real concern. Again I think that is another canary that we need to watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right.</p><p>FORBES: Uncertainty about a trade war too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Which thankfully it looks like it may be tamping down a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The trade war worries?</p><p>FORBES: Worries --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On your point, Dagen, cover story on the business section, Tesla, first it was the stock that traded down. Now we're worried about the bonds, because that's really showing liquid at this worries.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're nerds. We watch the debt. The equity doesn't really tell you the story. Again financial crisis in - leading up to 2008, it was all in and in the bonds for two years before the market really collapsed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to give a shout out to Zero Hedge, they did a very good job on this a couple of days ago before this really came out. Now we're seeing it all over the place. You were saying the trade war worries are fading, because people look at it now as a real negotiation opening bid on the president's part, don't they?</p><p>FORBES: Yes, the South Korea deal we'll be discussing later, tampering but not much change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes that's what Mary Kiesel (ph) said yesterday. We're going to talk with Peter Navarro about that coming up. But first there's this, President Trump is headed to Ohio this afternoon to talk about his $1.5 trillion plan on fixing America's roads and bridges. The pitch coming as his proposal appears to be stalled in Congress with some lawmakers concerned that state and local governments are responsible for the bulk of the spending. Here's a look back to what President Trump said about rebuilding our nation's infrastructure at his State Of The Union Address back in January.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State building in just one year. Isn't is a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I'm asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that Trump's plan could add between 290,000 to 414,000 infrastructure jobs over the next 10 years. Joining us right now is the Great America PAC Chairman, former Reagan Chief White House Political Advisor, and Fox News Contributor -</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Rollins. Ed, Good to see you. What do you expect the president to talk about today? Obviously money is tight. Where does the money come from for this infrastructure plan?</p><p>ROLLINS: Obviously it's a balance between federal investment and private investment and state. This should have been priority number one. If this would have gone up instead of the healthcare in the beginning, I think we would have had a big bill today. The problem today is I don't think we're going to have much after the big budget bill.</p><p>So I think until the Congress re-votes itself, in or out, I don't think we'll see much until January. The biggest problem here is the federal government's always put the biggest chunk in -- 80% on the highway bills (inaudible). He's talking about 20% today. A lot of these states and local communities don't have the resources. We don't have the resources at the federal level to do what we should do. And trying to get the private investment in there is going to be very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president, Dagen, wants $200 billion in federal money and then the rest of the $1.5 trillion to come from the private sector.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, though, Ed, there was $21 billion in new infrastructure spending that was in that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that omnibus bill -- that spending bill that the president acted like he was going to veto it and didn't. So there's --</p><p>ROLLINS: There's -</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- there are hands-out to construction in there.</p><p>ROLLINS: The problem always when you -- my first experience in Washington was the assistant secretary congressional (inaudible) department of transportation. Every member has their own special projects that they want. My sense is democrats, at this point in time, will do nothing to make the president look good. I do think they want this bill. I think it's not going to get done until at least January or February of next year.</p><p>FORBES: Is there any way with executive orders - or even in the transportation department, to remove the barriers, licensing barriers, permit barriers?</p><p>ROLLINS: I think that's very, very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the big issue.</p><p>ROLLINS: As you know well and Elaine Chao is as capable as anybody in this administration. My assumption is she's not going to get a tweet firing her in the foreseeable future. I think she can basically push a lot of this stuff. I think it's going to be a slow walk, it doesn't really need to be a fast walk from the get-go. It will create jobs. It will be a coalition because labor unions, what have you, all want these jobs. So democrats should be at the forefront of this, and they're basically stalling it. I think what they're going to try and do is split it into multi-bills, sewage type bills, highway bills, what have you as opposed to a big comprehensive bill.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who is going to pay for it though? This is my - this goes back to my issue, that, again, when you don't have the federal gas tax, when it hasn't gone up in more than 20 years, and then you expect what -- regular income taxpayers to pay for this? We're going to borrow it? Again, there's no financial responsibility in Washington.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well the last time you raised the gas tax, George Mitchell was the Senate Majority Leader back in 1991 and 1992.</p><p>FORBES: And then moreover, they've been using the gas tax for non-highway spending.</p><p>ROLLINS: Non-highway types things. So it's a big -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Trail (ph) of the original trust -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: How do you -</p><p>ROLLINS: Go ahead.</p><p>BELL: How do you get private investment to come in, make this attractive to them to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they all want in. I think a lot of private - well go ahead, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS: I feel the same way. I think if you have a real plan, and you see that the state and local and the federal government are going to coordinate and speed this process up, they'll put money in. If - but there's -- that piece of it's not done yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to invest in infrastructure if they think they won't get a return for 13 years.</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely. I think -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's one of the issues. They've got to roll back the regulations and the barriers and the red tape, and then I think they'll get the investment, don't you think, Ed?</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, and I think it's a high priority. And, again, it should have been the first priority. It should have been bill number one. And it wasn't, and now we have to wait on it --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think at the local level there will be blowback on having toll roads instead of supposed (ph) free roads?</p><p>ROLLINS: There is, but at the end of the day I think there's such a frustration at this point in time the old term free highways - or -- is just not possible.</p><p>FORBES: Free potholes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When I interviewed Jamie Dimon back in January, one of the things he said was \"I tried to invest,\" and he was looking at the Bayonne Bridge, Bayonne New Jersey and Staten Island.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The bridge crossing and it was going to take 13 years. That's when his team said \"You know what, let's put this aside right now.\" We've got to get to The White House shake up Ed., because Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin is now out. The latest to leave the Trump Administration with position to the president, and Ronnie Jackson tapped to replace him. Your thoughts, Ed? Shulkin is the second cabinet member to be fired just this month.</p><p>ROLLINS: He was an Obama holdover. He was, as you remember, was the unanimous appointment. I don't think he was a Trump guy from the beginning. He obviously self-destructed by his inconsistencies on following government regulations. The Admiral will be a unique choice. He made a brilliant decision in saying that the president weighed 239 pounds as opposed to 249 pounds, which would've put him in the obese category.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: So he's (inaudible) enough to know that. My sense is he's going to be a great outside spokesman. He's an admiral, he's a surgeon, and at this point in time it's one of the president's priorities, and he'll have the president's ear which is very important. Where I don't think the present secretary had the ear.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what I was thinking about, though, with the announcement of Shulkin, which was expected, people - again the headlines are always more White House chaos. And I thought to myself, maybe president Trump is actually firing people who deserve to be fired and in past administrations people hung around too long, because the president and their advisors were always reticent to make it look like we made a bad hire, we made a bad choice but this guy stinks, he's gone.</p><p>ROLLINS: I think you're right. The fact that he had been in an administration as the Deputy Secretary, he knew what the rules and regulations were. You don't take free tickets to Wimbledon. You don't go fly your wife all over the world on a -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who gave them to you? Umm (ph).</p><p>BELL: He's a really good friend, but I forgot his name.</p><p>ROLLINS: It's amazing this keeps coming up. Tom Price, former Health Secretary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Why does this keep coming up? You're absolutely right.</p><p>ROLLINS: The bottom line -- one of the jobs I had when I was in The White House is I would be the last person to talk to the cabinet officers. I'd say here there's rules and regulations. Read those basically and abide by them. If you have any doubt, call your Counsel - call Fred Fielding who was our Counsel. And you followed those rules. If you don't follow those rules, you're done. Just understand that. You're going to get over there. You're going to think you're imperial (ph), because you've got big offices and all the rest of it. At the end of the day, you've got to basically reverse taxpayers' dollars and it's a position of trust.</p><p>BELL: It's not your money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, more ugliness from Hollywood. Jim Carrey is slamming President Trump again. The actor tweeted a drawing of what appears to be the president's sons being attacked by an elephant. The caption says #teamelephant. Jim Carrey has posted other pictures. He bashed other people like White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. What's your take on this?</p><p>ROLLINS: My take is he's totally irrelevant today. He was a big movie star 20 years ago, 15 years ago, he hasn't made a buck they a movie in a long, long time. Political commentary (ph) cartoonists and always vicious. And this guy who's talentless, trying to basically be outrageous is being vicious.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we shouldn't make a big deal out of it.</p><p>FORBES: We used to have a show called \"Hollywood Squares\" where washed up actors would go --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>FORBES: Maybe he should resurrect that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I didn't think he was funny when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now Paul Lynde was never washed up, he was awesome. He was the famous center (ph) square, so I'm just putting him back on that (ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: It's good to know all of this stuff is not relevant to the ordinary people who are 18 and 19 years old anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim Carrey, you're irrelevant, that's the bottom line.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you know, I always thought in the next life - I'm now 75, I'd be a political cartoonist, because you get to get up everyday and slam somebody and a not pay a consequence. I think he will pay a consequence for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Ed, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins. Coming up, new FBI bombshell. Newly uncovered texts show possible coordination between the Obama Administration and all the agencies, CIA, FBI, Just Department, Democratic leadership as well in Congress on the Russia Investigation. The outrage coming up. And then until sleep do us part? A new survey, wait until you see what this says</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Looks like it will be a good open, this the final day of the quarter and the month for certainly markets and businesses concerned. Dow Industrials expected to be up 70 points this morning at the start of trading, up a third of a percent. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are also higher. Meanwhile, there's this, a slide in big technology stocks affecting many investors as companies gain more influence in the global stock markets. Cheryl Casone has headlines now, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONEl: Looking for those good earnings reports, Maria, from these guys you know after the slide in their stocks for the month of March. It has Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, nearly all of these guys losing ground yesterday, in particular with Facebook now sitting in bear market territory and Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon in correction territory. Technology stocks have been under fire over concerns of more regulatory oversight following the revelations over Facebook's misuse of user data. President Trump reportedly, again, suggesting that he might seek to change Amazon's tax status. So we hope the earnings are good, because the stocks have been hit this month. Well, a car merger reportedly is in the works this morning. Reports are saying that France's Renault is in talks with Japan's Nissan. A get together would build on the strategic alliance that the companies have actually had since 1999. Taking a look at shares of Renualt, it's up 13% so far this year.</p><p>British police say a former Russian spy and his daughter first came into contact with a nerve agent at their own front door. Authorities there are now focusing their investigation in and around their home. They're also searching for a person who could have delivered the poison to them. London of course blames Moscow for the attack, triggering a major diplomatic dispute between Russia and several Western countries including the United States.</p><p>And get this, nearly one-third of Americans want to file for sleep divorce from their partners. That's according to a brand new survey. That's a lot more than the study back in 2010, that found that one-quarter of couples have separate sleeping arrangements. But now it seems that some uncomfortable sleepers are afraid to bring up the idea of different beds. So let's just get a divorce. Here's another crazy stat of the 3,000 people surveyed, 300 say they've ended a previous relationship because of sleep issues. There you have it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't get in the middle of my sleep time.</p><p>CASONE: You need your sleep. And if you can't get on board with that, buddy, see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Facebook is under fire. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook says some big changes are needed at Facebook and needed fast. This comes as Facebook users scramble to protect themselves without waiting for regulatory crack downs. Then, Carnival Cruise Lines making a huge offer to a teenager for his Snapchat handle, even getting Shaquille O'Neal in on the action. Now the teen is sailing away with a win. The story coming up. Back in a moment</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>TIME COOK, CEO, APPLE: We care about the user experience, and we're not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of privacy. I think it's - privacy to us is a human right, it's a civil liberty.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, doubling down on his company's commitment to protecting user privacy. The comments come as the technology community remains under fire following Facebook's data scandal, which now sees several technology executives including Mark Zuckerberg being called to testify before congress. Joining us is the cyber guy, Kurt Knudsen (ph). Kirk, thanks for weighing in here. This scandal around Facebook has people scrambling to figure out how to protect their personal data. What can we do?</p><p>KURT KNUDSEN (ph): Maria, so true. Good morning to you. We're talking about it also, and how about Tim Cook? Does he not smell like a rose this morning in the manure of Silicon Valley? I think he's just trying to stay out of it. Facebook, though, not so lucky. Things you can do right now with your own devices. Six must do changes just to reign in a little bit of your privacy. Number one, you can turn off the ability for apps to have access to the data. I was shocked when I went to my own settings -- you simply remove the apps on Facebook. I went to my own settings and I saw 74 apps, about half of which I never even remembered giving access to my life, and they have it.</p><p>Also, set alerts so if your Facebook is logged on at another location or another device that you're familiar with, it's going to let you know. And then disable the Facebook integration. It's so easy to use this where you log onto other websites and instead of putting in all of the form, you just log on with Facebook. But what we now know, that we didn't really know very clearly before, is that they're using that as a path to, again, share our personal data.</p><p>So the list goes on. Limiting access to the apps that you use, location privacy, turning that off as well as the history which is like the bread crumbs of everywhere you go, and then number one thing, tell your friends to do these same settings, because you're vulnerable to what your friends allow through also. So if they can see what's on your profile, Maria, they're also going to see access to being able to carry that data away and give it to a third party app.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean we were all doing this ourselves the other day, looking at our apps to try to figure out what's open and what isn't. You have to go into Facebook and then there's another area just for the apps, right, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're trying to basically make changing your privacy settings easier. That was one of the announcements yesterday. But again, it's never been clear. And that's really the whole point, is over the years Facebook has asked you for more and more of your personal information, just down to even the most granular detail about where you went to elementary school. And what do they do? They slice it and dice it and let these app developers in to access it. And you really don't know what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then so what the alternative is, if you want to delete your profile, Kurt, they don't make it that easy either. Your history is still - -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): No one's going to do that, I'm sorry.. You've got Elon Musk over in California, big drama (ph) answering some removing myself as well as the companies off of Facebook. No one is going to really do that. That's not a practical solution. The practical solution may be taking a look at the leadership at Facebook and saying by now, after all of thee flaws, one after another and the messes that Facebook has, especially related to personal data, you have Mark Zuckerberg who always is reluctant to show face, he comes out, he makes a big grand corrective gesture and then you see about a 5% action of what he said would be some spectacular new direction. I'm soft on him. I don't like what the company's done. I think he's a spectacular human being, great leader, love what he built. But I think they need a grown-up inside of Facebook. They're clearly not out for our interests. They're out to serve themselves, to grow their platform and to make money off of apps (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's not going anywhere.</p><p>FORBES: Kurt (ph) - can he -- he's going to be testifying to Congress. Can he finally settle this in congress and say here's what we're doing?</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Not a chance. Two weeks from now, he's due to show up. There's no way. I'm sorry. Again, that's just going to be theater on his part. There's something very awkward about him in the public, whether he's on camera or he's at a group. That's probably why they kept him, and he's kept himself from being in public forums. He's not the best communicator.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well there's -</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Put Sheryl Sandberg up there, there might be a different story.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- testimony --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a Chief Operating Officer named Sheryl Sandberg, but she has been too busy telling women how to treat other women, rather than actually running the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mean \"Lean In.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, whatever it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Lean In,\" yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whatever hooey (ph) message that was.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Entire book (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as we've spoken before, if he doesn't want to step down, he's not going anywhere, he's got full voting control, Steve Forbes. People need to understand that when they buy Facebook shares.</p><p>FORBES: They know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's making all the decisions. Kurt (ph), thank you.</p><p>KNUDSEN (ph): Yes, his architecture in setting up that was brilliant. He's got control.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently. Kurt Knudsen (ph), thank you so much. Coming up, new Russia probe bombshells, newly uncovered text messages - we told you they were coming, now we know. They are between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They strongly suggest a coordination between President Obama's White House, former Senate democrats, and the CIA early on in the Russia Investigation. The outrage coming up this morning. Then I-Hop making the top five list of casual ding customers with the most loyal customers. But which one flies to number one? The big reveal coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Thursday. It is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:30am on the east coast. Stocks are looking to rebound this morning. Check it out, Dow Industrials are up 70 points right now, S&amp;P up 9, and the Nasdaq is up 43. This marks the final trading day of the month and the final trading day of the quarter.</p><p>The first quarter was a tough one for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 on track for the first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closed the day yesterday lower. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down almost 1% on the session as technology once again took a hit. The Dow was down only nine points and the S&amp;P down only seven yesterday.</p><p>Global markets are higher this morning. Take a look at European indices this morning, the FT-100, the (inaudible), and the Dax Index all up this morning. In Asia overnight stocks edged higher at the close, as you will see. The Shanghai Composite was the best performer there, up one and a quarter percent in China.</p><p>Technology was the big pressure on the market yesterday, but this morning we're looking at a relief rally underway. The biggest names in the sector all higher at the open today. As you can see, Facebook is up one and a quarter percent, and Netflix is up 1% as well.</p><p>New questions this morning over the collusion. This time it is against democrats. The shocking allegations revealed in new text messages. They show coordination between The White House and law enforcement agencies, President Obama's White House. Here's how House Intelligence Committee Chairmen Devin Nunes reacted last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The left continued to say that \"This is Watergate,\" and \"Trump's going to be impeached.\" They continued that. Well now this has effectively boomeranged on them.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The fallout coming up this morning. And then play ball. It is opening day today for major league baseball. We have a look at the top matchups. All 30 clubs will be playing today. Plus flying high with customers. People love I-Hop right? But there is one place they actually love more. We have the top restaurant for customer loyalty coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus there's this, trading up, Carnival Cruise is offering a teenager a luxury trip in exchange for a Snapchat handle. We've got the story coming up. And then from the grid iron to the silver screen, details on Rob Gronkowski's new role in a Mel Gibson film. All those stories coming up, but first this top story this half an hour.</p><p>FBI fury over newly uncovered text messages. GOP Congressional investigators telling Fox News the text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page strongly suggest coordination between officials in the Obama Administration, former Senate Democratic Leadership, the CIA, the FBI, and the Justice Department during the early stages of the Russia Investigation. Is anyone surprised?</p><p>In one of the text messages Strzok texts Page this, \"Internal joint cyber CD Intel piece for D.\" This refers to former FBI Director James Comey. \"Is the scene setter for Former Chief Of Staff under Obama, Denis McDonough's (ph) brief, Trainor the Head of the FBI Cyber Division directed all cyber info be pulled. I'd let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be best for D to have it before the Wednesday White House Session.\" So they had the meeting at The White House it appears. House Intelligence Committee Chiarman Devin Nunes has been leading the charge on this, and he reacted to what was revealed last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE The democrats appear like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services by using the foreign intelligence surveillance apparatus in this country to go and target the opposition campaign, is totally unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner and Fox News Contributor Byron York. Byron, great to see you.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Remember during the election when Hillary Clinton always used to say \"Seventeen agencies said there was collusion between Trump and Russia\" Remember that B.S.? They were -- what do you think these texts tell us?</p><p>YORK: Well, these texts are important for two reasons, for what they say and for the fact that the Justice Department hid important facts about them from Congress. On what they say, one of the things we've been trying to find out for quite a while is about the Trump dossier, about the allegations in the Trump dossier, how high in the Obama Administration did knowledge of those allegations go?</p><p>And what these texts show is that shortly after the FBI formally began its Trump Russia, counter intelligence investigations -- this is in August of 2016, shortly after the investigation gets underway, they are talking -- Strzok and Page are talking about briefing Dennis McDonough who was President Obama's Chief of Staff.</p><p>Now remember, we have heard democrats being critical of President Trump for keeping tabs on the FBI investigation. Here at the very least it appears The White House may have been keeping tabs on the FBI investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know the FBI and the DOJ are now officially under investigation for the FISA abuses in the Russia probe as well. That was of course made earlier this month by House Intel Committee. DOJ's Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced yesterday he's reviewing what FBI officials and the Justice Departtment knew when they asked a federal court to let them spy on Carter Page during the presidential campaign.</p><p>So Byron, basically they created this narrative that there was collusion between Trump and the Russians. Then they paid for -- the Democratic Party paid for the dossier with unverified stuff. They take it to the FISA court. They get a warrant based on that unverified dossier to spy on the Trump campaign all during the election. It's extraordinary to me that he actually still won. I mean, it is.</p><p>YORK: When you hear the Inspector General or you hear republicans talking about investigating FISA abuse, they're really investigating the dossier. If you look at the charging -- if you look at the description of how the Inspector General is going to investigate, it's about this dossier, how did they get it, what was the role of the former British spy, Christopher Steele in doing it, why did they agree to pay Christopher Steele to work on this at the same time Steele was being paid by the Clinton campaign, and finally how did they use it in the FISA warrant application?</p><p>But one last thing about the Justice Department not being open about this, on these Strzok Page texts, they sent a lot of the texts to Congress, but a lot of them -- parts of them were redacted. They were blacked out. And the FBI said \"Look, these two people were having an affair. There's a lot of personal information in the texts. We're going to cover that up. You don't need to see that.\" Congress said \"Fine, we're not investigating their relationship.\" But what they have now discovered is that the FBI and the Justice Department also covered up important facts like Dennis McDonough's name. So they learned that, wow, there's an Obama White House official involved here and that was previously redacted -</p><p>FORBES: Well Byron -</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely right, and they also redacted the texts about wanting to go to a party with the FISA judge. Let's not forget that, Judge Contreras. Go ahead, Steve.</p><p>FORBES: Byron, one of the things the other side has been good at is muddying the waters, making it complicated so people can't grasp it in a tweet, you might say. Where does this go from here? Will we get a special prosecutor? Is Sessions going to step up to the plate and make sure justice is done here? A lot of revelations. What happens next? What's the next step?</p><p>YORK: Well the first thing that's going to happen, probably, will be the release of this inspector general's report that you've heard about. It's not an investigation into the Trump Russia investigation, but it is an investigation into how Andrew McCabe, James Comey, the FBI handled the Hillary Clinton investigation and, boy, we know there's plenty of questions about what they did there. So look for that to come out basically at the same time as James Comey's national book tour.</p><p>FORBES: Just a coincidence.</p><p>YORK: So we'll - you will find out about that. This new inspector general investigation just announced into the dossier and the handling of the dossier, you know what happens with those. They take a long time. It will eventually come out but not for probably at least a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron, I want to add to that. The Inspector General has limited power to compel the testimony from people who no longer work within the government like Andrew McCabe.</p><p>YORK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jim Comey.</p><p>MCDOWELL: and Jim Comey. Sp do you think we still get a Special Counsel on this?</p><p>YORK: Yes, you have given the Trey Gowdy argument in favor of a Special Counsel, because look at all the people involved. They can only investigate people who are employees of the Justice Department. James Comey is no longer an employee, neither is Andrew McCabe. Christopher Steele never was. What about Fusion GPS? All these people who can't be investigated. That is the strongest argument for a Special Counsel, but I have to say, I haven't seen any indication right now that that's going to happen.</p><p>FORBES: What's Sessions' hang up on this?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: There are a lot of republicans who are just opposed philosophically to the idea of Special Counsel. They believe - and they're correct, that it results in mission creep. They go forever. They go all over the place. I mean we're seeing that in the Mueller campaign, because -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YORK: -- but the reason this one's gone off the track, the current one, is because the parameters were not there. If you set specific parameters on what you can and cannot do when you appoint that Special Counsel, you can prevent the abuses. But the number two in the Justice Department didn't do that, which is why Mueller is going all over the place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right, but let me just add to that because the initial mandate here, Byron, was that Bob Mueller looks at collusion with the Trump campaign or collusion between Trump and Russia. So why is the investigation still going on? If we know that this is a whole bunch of nothing, and that they created this whole narrative to keep Donald Trump out of The White House, why is Robert Mueller continuing this charade?</p><p>YORK: Well --</p><p>FORBES: Because the guardrails were not put in. They said it, but they didn't make it in a specific way, this is what you can and cannot do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, he can go into obstruction of justice, he can go wherever he wants.</p><p>FORBES: He can investigate us if he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>YORK: We should always be careful in talking about Mueller, because there's a lot of stuff we don't know. But on the collusion front, look at this, he has charged several people who are very high in the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Richard Gates -- people who if there had been a scheme to conspire with the Russians, they would have been involved, they would have known about it. And yet they've been charged with criminal acts, none of which involved any collusion.</p><p>FORBES: Exactly.</p><p>YORK: So that's a good reason for us to believe that maybe it's not going to happen. And as far as obstruction is concerned, we know he is investigating that, but we also know one other thing. As far as President Trump personally is concerned, he's the president. He's not going to be charged with a crime and dragged into a courtroom. If anything happens, it would be the political process of impeachment and all these legal arguments we hear about, they're not really going to be as important as the political argument of president Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right real quick, Byron, we've got to jump, but do you think anybody goes to jail over the massive abuse of power?</p><p>YORK: Anybody in the FBI, it would be very unlikely. I think people on Capitol Hill want to expose this. They want to find out what happened. I don't think they want to send anybody behind bars. They want to find out what happened right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron, we'll leave it there. Good to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>YORK: Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Byron York joining us there. Coming up, play ball, it's baseball's opening day today, but the hope for all 50 teams to hit the diamond today are dashed. We'll tell you why. Then, from New England to Hollywood? Rob Gronkowski may be sharing the big screen with Mel Gibson. We'll be back in a moment with that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Nobel Prize winner and human rights activist is back home in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot by Taliban militants. Cheryl Casone with the story. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, Malala Yousafzai he was shot in 2012 by militants who were angry over her support for teaching girls. Just hours after she arrived in Pakistan, she met with Pakistan's Prime Minister and said she was excited to be back in her country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MALALA YOUSAFZAI: (Inaudible) in 2007 to 2009, and then seeing how many (inaudible) in our society and how we can fight against those challenges.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Malala adding how she always planned to come home after having to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Her visit is expected to last four days. Well, the Saudi Arabian stock market is joining FTSE Russell's emerging market index. That's going to start March of next year. The move is expected to draw billions of dollars of foreign portfolio investment into the country. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister was on the show earlier this week, talking about the country's reforms launched by the crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, FINANCE MINISTER, SAUDI ARABIA: We are at the stage where we moved from planning over the past two years to execution. So there is significant positive momentum now, where the economy is going.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is expected to unveil rules by the end of June to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies. Officials say this is the final regulatory step for the listing of Saudi Aramco. And then there's this, the winner of the hunger games, not the movie, but the casual restaurant with the most loyal customers is Buffalo Wild Wings. Others in the top 10 include Applebee's, Hooters, and Beef `O' Brady's. Buffalo Wild Wings was acquired by the private equity firm that also owns Arby's, by the way, Roark Capital, back in November.</p><p>Then there is this. A Virginian teen is taking a cruise of a lifetime for the small price of Snapchat handle. Fifteen year old Darian Lipscomb recreated the handle at @Carnival Cruise years ago, because he was a super fan of the cruise line. Well Carnival wanted it. They went to prospect to find Darian, even putting up a giant billboard, asking for help When they did find him, they offered him a trip worth $5,000 on their latest vessel, the Carnival Horizon. He's taking his entire family, Maria. There is shares of Carnival year-to-date (ph). It's down a buck 09 yesterday. All right, I've got to say I would have taken the money and I don't know, invested it for college, butt that's just me, bur he took the cruise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He wanted the cruise. Hey, he's smart to get that handle.</p><p>FORBES: What if they had investeed in Facebook, you know?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Or Snapchat.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, Gronk (ph) the movie star? The New England Patriots' tight end may be in a new action film with Mel Gibson. We've got the details right after this.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well move over Michael Jordan, here comes Lebron. Jared has the story right now. Hey Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FBN SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. More folks saying \"Lebron, is he the best ever?\" Every regular season NBA game Lebron has played since January 6th, 2007, he has scored at least 10 points a game.</p><p>Last night, this dunk by Lebron against the Charlotte Hornets pushed his point total to 10 points for the game. Ten, the milestone marker, 866 consecutive games Lebron has scored double digit points. This ties an NBA record shared by Michael Jordan, who happens to own the Hornets team that Lebron of the Cavaliers beat last night. Lebron finished with 41 points, which is 15 fewer than the 56 scored by Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns last night, a (inaudible) record.</p><p>Hey, happy Hope-ening Day. Every team is in first place this morning, before the baseball season begins 12:40 eastern. Earliest opening day ever, March 29th. Commissioner Rob Manfred spoke Maria Bartiromo earlier this week. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: We think getting back to the tradition of everybody playing on opening day is an exciting thing for the sport. I think it gives us an opportunity to own Thursday, make opening day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MAX: Yes, alll 30 MLB teams were scheduled to play today, but the Reds game in Cincinnati against the Nationals postponed because of a rainy forecast. They'll make it up tomorrow, first game 12:40 in Miami between the Cubs and the Marlins.</p><p>History will be made in the NFL next season, the L.A. Rams are going to have two male cheerleaders. While the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore Ravens do have men who perform stuns with the female cheerleaders, Quinton Peron and Napolean Jinnies will actually be cheerleaders dancing part of the squad of 40 with the Rams.</p><p>Speaking of dancing, we've seen Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's moves. Last week he was on the shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal. Now he's going to make another movie. Gronk reportedly has signed on for an acting role in an upcoming action movie that is going to star Mel Gibson, and the movie is titled \"Boss Level.\" He was just in a movie last year too, \"Clapper,\" too. So Gronk's doing it all. After the Super Bowl,l he made comments that made you think is he looking to retire? Maybe he sees that there's a future outside of football that has nothing to do with getting your head knocked around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, would that get you to go see the movie?</p><p>MCDOWELL: If Mel Gibson isn't in it, I would go see it.</p><p>MAX: That's not going to happen with them together (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would probably go -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Mel Gibson has a career left, I have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given his horrible behavior, remember the drunk driving charge -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the horrible slurs</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: -- it was just like gosh (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the way he speaks to women, the rants that were caught on audio. By the way, Gronk, I get to tell my one Gronk story. I saw him wearing a Spongebob backpack down in Miami once.</p><p>MAX: He is a Spongebob backpack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of his size, I bet he photographs very well on the big screen.</p><p>MAX: Yes, in this country, there are numerous second acts, third acts -- tenth acts. You're never down forever. Lebron James' acts (ph) is still pretty good -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at Roseanne (ph).</p><p>MAX: -- (inaudible) what he's got too.</p><p>FORBES (ph): Remember, Trump went after Rosanne in that first debate in 2015 when you called out statements about women, he said \"Oh Rosanne,\" everyone laughed. Now they're best buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow interesting, Jared, thank you. Jared Max, catch the sports sports reports and Fox News headlines 24/7, Sirius XM115. Still ahead, we head to outer space. That's next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018032902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S09-SBD1-JB20-G2BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is a start.\" </p><p>The move nonetheless opens Mark Zuckerberg's company to claims that liberal-leaning employees are quashing opinions with which they disagree, an argument made by conservatives ever since social media platforms began trying to weed out content posted by agents from Russia and other hostile nations to influence U.S. voters. </p><p>Intelligence officials in the U.S. have said the Kremlin used such tactics to promote President Trump's candidacy in 2016, an assessment backed up in a recent report from special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating whether the campaign knowingly cooperated.</p><p>[Related: Facebook bans white nationalist speech]</p><p>\u201cOnce you start banning people for speech, inevitably you\u2019re picking and choosing which speech you approve, and we don\u2019t believe the social media companies should be trusted to do that,\u201d said Dan Gainor, vice president of the Media Research Center\u2019s TechWatch. \u201cThey have policies that are liberal, staff that are liberal, and inevitably we think conservatives are the ones who suffer for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCensoring people is like eating peanuts,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you eat one, you just can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Chief among Facebook\u2019s critics is President Trump, who tweeted in the wake of its announcement that he is monitoring and watching \u201cthe censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the United States of America \u2014 and we have what\u2019s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH!\u201d he tweeted.</p><p>The president warned in subsequent posts that social media is \u201cgetting worse and worse for conservatives\u201d and signaled support for one of the people kicked off Facebook, right-wing internet personality Paul Joseph Watson.</p><p>Joining the president in his attack on Facebook was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who accused the tech giant of mounting a \u201ccensorship campaign\u201d that could result in platforms systematically purging conservatives.</p><p>\u201cThe purposeful and calculated silencing of conservatives by [Facebook] &amp; the rest of the Big Tech monopoly men should terrify everyone,\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted.</p><p>But Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, said Facebook \u201chesitated for a long time\u201d before its action.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they don\u2019t relish doing it, but eventually if someone is repeatedly violating the standards you\u2019ve set out as governing behavior in your privately owned platform, you\u2019re going to bid that person farewell,\u201d Barrett said.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s issues, he said, are symptoms of its reach and influence, and have been exacerbated by its own technologies that boost widely shared posts.</p><p>\u201cThe extremist and sensationalistic and conspiracy-oriented expressions of people like Alex Jones, at least in part, reflect Alex Jones\u2019 understanding that his posts will get more circulation on Facebook and on Twitter because of their very nature,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s because of the algorithms Facebook and Twitter use that encourage sharing of sensationalistic material, because that keeps people\u2019s attention, and attention is what Facebook sells to its advertisers and that\u2019s the business model.\u201d </p><p>Jones, a 45-year-old community college dropout, stirred controversy when he pantomimed shooting Mueller and was sued by parents of some of the 20 children killed in a December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., over his claims the shooting was staged. In 2002, he wrote a book linking the George W. Bush administration to what he said was a conspiracy behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>To address hate and fearmongering on Facebook, some lawmakers have suggested Congress could step in, which Barrett warned could lead to government overreach. </p><p>Lawmakers' criticisms of Facebook and other platforms reached a fever pitch in March after a gunman whom police said killed 50 in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, livestreamed the shooting. </p><p>The 17-minute video was flagged by a user but remained on Facebook for roughly 30 minutes before it was taken down. Facebook subsequently removed 1.5 million videos of the massacre in the first 24 hours, of which 1.2 million were blocked at upload. </p><p>The events prompted the House Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing last month on hate speech that included representatives from Facebook and Google. Republicans used the session to accuse tech companies of censoring conservatives, while Democrats noted the First Amendment prohibits the government, not private companies, from restricting freedom of speech.</p><p>The potential for federal involvement in content regulation is a \u201cprime reason why Facebook, Twitter, YouTube need to devote a ton of resources right now to figuring out how to better govern themselves,\u201d Barrett said.</p><p>He believes social media companies need to invest more in algorithms that identify false material, backed up by staff who understand the affairs of other nations. Facebook has done both, but Zuckerberg has welcomed more regulation, arguing that social media companies shouldn't make such sweeping decisions on their own.</p><p>Gainor, however, wants Facebook and others to \u201cembrace the First Amendment, not to embrace global censorship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom of speech is uncomfortable sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, the way to look at this is people should be able to determine what they want to see, not Facebook determining what they want to see.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2234509418</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DFB1-JBHT-D39G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

CNN's Matthew Chance joining us now from Moscow. So, Facebook publicly saying it doesn't really know for sure who's buying it. But we're hearing that it's probably a Russian group and certainly the same sort of fingerprints. What's been the reaction there?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, the reaction, Michael, as you might expect from Russian authorities has been one of -- one of denial, instead, default stance whenever they're confronted with these kinds of allegations. They've denied any kind of hacking or attempting to intervene in the U.S. political workings of repeatedly since those allegations were first made.</p><p>Maria Zakharova who is the foreign ministry spokeswoman here in Moscow said it shows the evidence essentially and will comment on that.</p><p>But as of course, as you just reported, as you just heard Drew Griffin reports, the evidence that Facebook has by its own admission is not conclusive and it would require a sort of political assessment in order to point the finger of blame into Facebook have held back from doing that purposely, calling on the intelligence agencies to make an assessment, of course, U.S. politicians have pointed the finger at Russian.</p><p>[03:05:03] But because there is that small element of doubt that the evidence isn't entirely conclusive that will always give the Russians the ability to say no, it's not us. Michael?</p><p>HOLMES:  And I guess, you know, and you're right. They can't point names, they can't say anything for certain but the fact that it is going on that disinformation it's widespread despite the publicity that as you said, members of Congress, if not the president speaking out. It just shows that whoever is doing it thinks it's working and it is worth it.</p><p>CHANCE:  It would seem that way. I mean, look, if it is Russia, and of course Russia has a record of doing this, intelligence agencies in the United States have concluded that Russian did hacked and intervene and manipulate social media in order to, you know, meddle in U.S. politics in the past in the lead to the 2016 presidential election of course.</p><p>If it did do it, it's been sanctioned for it. A number of military intelligence GIU officers were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department just earlier this month. </p><p>And of course, there have been other sanctions put on the internet research agency which is St. Petersburg company with strong links to the Kremlin which is believed orchestrated the manipulation of social media from Russia in the lead up to that 2016 presidential race.</p><p>But clearly, that punishment of sanctions has not been enough to deter whoever is doing this from doing it again. Perhaps the reason for that, Michael, is because one of the objectives we've assessed for these internet hackers, et cetera, is to sow discord in western institutions.</p><p>And by backing these various political groups and these political rallies in the United States that result is achieved.</p><p>HOLMES:  Yes, precisely. Matthew, thanks for that. Matthew Chance there in Moscow for us. </p><p>The first trial stemming from Robert Mueller's Russia investigation underway in the U.S. state of Virginia.

There will be a full honor ceremony for the remains that have been brought back from North Korea. Now they came back on Friday. </p><p>There's been a couple of days where forensic experts here at the Osan Air Base in South Korea have been shifting through those remains to try and ascertain whether or not what North Korea had said about them appears to be true.</p><p>We just had a press conference from the head of the DPAA, the Department for the Prisoners of War and the MIA that there's (Inaudible) of repatriation around the world that different combats learned.

Now that of course was the party Mugabe helped create. </p><p>But on the eve of the vote he announced he wasn't going to vote for it.

They were making noises earlier that they weren't happy with how the vote was unfolding.</p><p>ZENZELE NDEBELE, JOURNALIST:  Yes. The opposition don't agreeing with the results. They think that they result was rigged. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is working with the ruling party to make sure that they don't win. </p><p>So even (Inaudible) the people projecting in the Harare, saying that they don't believe what came out of the result. I think it's going to be really a very serious in the next few days with the way the results are coming out. People are going to be disappointed because most of the opposition members they are expecting change.</p><p>I see them going into the street demonstrating (inaudible) that they can sustain the image because this is quite big victory for the Zanu- PF. I'm not sure whether they will really provide evidence that the result had been rigged because that is what is important.</p><p>And with all the 46 mission, observer mission from different countries, if the observer mission don't collaborate their side of the story that the election had been rigged then they will have a problem.</p><p>HOLMES:  Yes, good point. When it comes to Zanu-PF and Robert Mugabe saying he wasn't going to vote for the party that he helped found, what are the challenges for the Zanu-PF there because there are still enormous economic issues and challenges facing Zimbabwe. </p><p>NDEBELE:  Yes, I think, I mean, for some reason Zanu-PF rebranded themselves when they fired Robert Mugabe there were some people who were I mean, voting for Zanu-PF just because voting for Emmerson Mnangagwa just because he removed Robert Mugabe. </p><p>So I think that the removal of Mugabe was blissful for Zanu-PF and therefore put some reasoning. I mean, his -- Mugabe speech that he wasn't going to vote for Zanu will not affect Zanu-PF at all. </p><p>There are some people who thought that Mugabe this youth crowd that followed him and what he say is then going to be followed by (Inaudible). But this election clearly Zanu-PF is an institution and not an individual and the opposition have moved on to firing Robert Mugabe.</p><p>HOLMES:  Interesting days ahead. Zenzele Ndebele, thank you so much for joining us there from Harare to talk about this. I appreciate it.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters slowly making progress against deadly wildfires ravaging California, but the weather doing them no favors. Extreme heat, strong winds forecast for this week could spread the flames even further.</p><p>Have a look at that video there. The largest fire the so-called Carr Fire is now the seventh most destructive in California's history. Thirty percent contained we're told, 30 percent. At least six people have died in that fire, four others are missing.</p><p>Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri is at the CNN weather center, he joins us now with more on the weather conditions affecting those fires up. Yes, I mean, what do we say this, seventh largest in history for California but most of the biggest ones in the top 10 had been in the recent years, haven't they?</p><p>[03:24:59] PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Absolutely. And you know, in fire records I'll go back to the 1920s in California. In fact, you can look at that and 8 of the top 10 have happened since the 2000. So, it kind of, another way to look at it of how frequent this has been happening in recent years. </p><p>And of course the persistent broad air is in high pressure, the persistent drought, the extreme heat, all of them playing a role into exacerbating the problem. And down at the ground level we'll certainly see gusty winds here and extreme temperatures. Unfortunately, that pattern it looks to continue a couple more days. But, finally, if we're going to see a shift here for the better, and really seeing how extensive this has been.</p><p>Because one way to look at how explosive of a fire weather pattern we had is that, look at the peak of this particular fire, the Carr Fire. We had at one point 11 hectares per minute of land being consumed across this region. </p><p>Another way to look at that is think about every three seconds. The size of a football field being consumed by wildfires. That's what was happening here in Northern California in the last couple of days and conditions have remained, so unsettled with the dry condition but even in the last 24 hours as we talked to you yesterday. </p><p>The active fires across the western U.S. have gone from 90 to almost 100 now. So we're still seeing additional fires popping up across this region, and of course the gusty wind, the extreme heat is not helping out the forecast --</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES:  Welcome back, everyone.  I'm Michael Holmes.  Time to update you on the top stories this hour.  49 people in hospital in Mexico after an aero Mexico flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Durango.  The pilot and the passenger in critical condition.  The plane was scheduled to fly to Mexico City.  It had 101 people on board.  It was hail and heavy rain in the area around the time of the crash.  Not known, however, whether that factor.  Incredibly no deaths.  </p><p>Prosecutors are laying out their case against the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.  They say he avoided paying taxes on millions earned through lobbying work in Ukraine.  The defense pointing the finger at Manafort's former Deputy, Rick Gates, who is working with prosecutors.  </p><p>Facebook shutting down dozens of pages and accounts with could be link to Russia, and may have blew it hundreds of thousands of followers. The social media giant says it identified a new and coordinated U.S. effort to interfere in U.S. politics and mislead American voters ahead of November's congressional election.  </p><p>A CNN political analyst Brian Karem joins me now from Washington, he is also the executive editor of the Sentinel newspaper.  Good to see you, Brian.  </p><p>BRIAN KAREM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good to see you, Michael.  How are you doing?  </p><p>HOLMES:  Doing well.  I guess it is no surprise that this is still happening, because by all accounts it works so well the last time. Facebook says it is doing what it can, what about the reaction of the Trump administration?   KAREM:  Well, the Trump administration reaction to this issue has been muted at best. He has -- the president is kind of confuse the two issues.  He doesn't want to really admit there is a problem, because he so busy defending himself against charges of collusion that to admit that the Russians in any way help them.  He doesn't want to face that possibility, or that or the reality of that and so while he's talking about collusion, he is ignoring the fact that the simple fact that the last election was affected by Russian trolls that are added again and were inadequately prepared for it.  And so he's left the preparation for this up to the states and up to the Senate and up to Congress to do something about it and without leadership from the top is questionable as to whether or not it will effectively be able to head this off to the passes were doing about it in every situation.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Do you think that is the president's sensitivity about the election, I mean, he just does not want for his presidency to be seen as illegitimate in any way and by giving credence to all of this. What impact that the interference had which clearly was significant. By giving that credence.  He's hurting his own credibility in a way of legitimacy is that the problem, so therefore the problem are being tackled.  </p><p>KAREM:  Well, his credibility and his legitimacy is up for debate on any given day for a number of reasons, of which this is just merely one.  It's isn't but the heart of the issue is an outside country tampering with and influencing the elections of the largest democracy on the planet and undermining the very foundations of our Republic and you have to address that for a country to be legitimate. It's its elections have to be so and we have in this country sent a, you know, to different countries to oversee their elections to make sure they're legitimate and so are we going to now have to have people from the United Nations come to the United States and oversee hours.  That's the scary prospect of it.  How serious is this?  </p><p>We won't really know until someone in this administration and the administration as a whole takes it as seriously as we all know it to be.  The Facebook is taking it more seriously than he is.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Well, I was just going to say, even there assigned to the problem clearly is difficult to spot and stop.  Is the country able to stop this sort of interference?  It's not -- it's not hard to set up a Facebook page and start agitating.  </p><p>KAREM:  Well, yes, and agitation is one thing, manipulation of elections is another.  And yes, the agitation that the agitation is real.  The trolls on the twitter trolls and the Facebook trolls are all real and they're all setting out what he calls fake news and that is influencing, you know, voters.  So, you have to really kind of -- two different things working with our elections.  The direct interference in hacking of election sites and election machinery and then the influence of those who do vote by the trolls.  The Russian trolls on Facebook and twitter and those of the two issues that we have to face as voters in this country.  </p><p>[03:35:15] HOLMES:  Yes, and I guess the extent of it is pretty clear that Facebook saying more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspects pages, that is a lot of followers.  In recent weeks, of course there has been other aspects of meddling, you know, of this report that Claire McCaskill, Senate Democrats --  </p><p>KAREM:  The right.  </p><p>HOLMES:  There were attempting to hack her as well.  So, were not just talking social media and you mentioned polling machines as well.  </p><p>KAREM:  Yes.  You know, you have to remember the history of this country goes back to the hanging chad elections with George W. Bush and you know we didn't want mechanical counting of the elections we wanted it more streamlined, more efficient, because of what happened there, but when you go to the electronic counting when you go to be able to count your votes and then get on the Internet, you know with the same machine, you're gonna have trouble and so were finding that perhaps maybe the old-fashioned paper ballot that is in such a bad idea after all.  </p><p>You rather have a hanging chad then have hanging elections.  It's going to be very difficult to sort this all out.  It is very difficult for electors and you have to remember that in this country, you know the elections are run by precinct captains, they are run by counties and states, and so each state has different machinery.  Sometimes different counties have different machinery, sometimes different precincts have different machinery and if you're able to get online with that machinery and count the votes then someone is going to be only get online and hack those machines.  And that's what happened previously.  </p><p>So, when you put together the Facebook trolls that the Internet trolls, influencing legitimate votes with a lot of fake news and stuff, but you know, honestly, is a legitimate and then you have that compounded by those who go and hack the machinery, it's hard to tell exactly how much of the Russian trolls have affected our elections and we do know that they have.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Just before I let you go.  It's quite -- it was quite a depressing picture that you paint there, we got the midterm elections coming up obviously crucial elections for the Trump administration and for the Democrats.  </p><p>KAREM:  Yes.  </p><p>HOLMES:  I mean, how do you feel?  Do you have confidence in how those elections will go?  </p><p>KAREM:  Good question.  I have hope that will go well.  I do know that there are people in Congress, the Senate and in Maryland at the state level in other states, Missouri, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, has spoken with people there who are working hard to make sure and ensuring that the election is legitimate, but there are 50 states in this grand and glorious union.  There are a lot of precincts and there are a lot of machines, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. So the best I can do is hope and I hope that the people in office care more about the election results and the legitimacy of the election over their own party and it will make the right decision.  Now, that I do have faith then, but the machinery, I have faith in people machinery not so much.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Yes.  You're right, each state and different precincts have different systems are being concern here in the state of Georgia, about the machines as well.  Brian, good to see you, Brian Karem.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>KAREM:  Thank you.  </p><p>HOLMES:  The Philippine president, Rodrigo Detective, is not afraid to show criminals he means business and to prove his point, he oversaw this, the destruction of dozens of luxury cars, we are talking Lamborghinis, Porsche, Mustangs, and all of them had been smuggled into the country.

It is a tactic he has used before as part of his anticorruption campaign sending a very visual message like bulldozers crushing $5 million worth of cars.  </p><p>It is latest target in the gun-control battle coming up, as jobs full to log on plans for 3-D printable guns going online, for now.  </p><p>Plus, three newborn babies abandoning Germany over two year period.

The founder of Defense Distributed told CNN's Laurie Segall, him, it is a freedom of speech issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CODY WILSON, FOUNDER DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED:  I already uploads the plans, I mean, ship to sell, it is (inaudible) information now.  It is regrettable, no one can take it back.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  The democratization of guns online giving people the ability to 3d print their own gun would make it feasible for felons, minors, mentally ill, to have access of firearms.  Are you worried about those repercussions?  </p><p>WILSON:  No, I don't believe the access information is ever tremendously negative or that thing.  I know that people can use information for bad things.  But this is a justification to what stop a publisher from speaking.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HOLMES:  Our CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Page Pate, joins me now here on set always a pleasure, sir.  Good to see you.  </p><p>PAGE PATE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Great to be here.  </p><p>HOLMES:  This is a Temporary Restraining Order, blocking it being on the internet.  What does that mean in a legal sense in terms of this going forward?  </p><p>PATE:  Well, basically means that a federal judge looked at this lawsuit that was filed by a number of different states and said there's enough here for me to put a stop to this now.  So that we can later argue about the real issues and whether this particular entity has a constitutional right to publish this material, or whether the government has a more important right to stop the publishing of these blueprints.  </p><p>HOLMES:  That is interesting, because their argument.  The ones you want to stop out there.  Their argument is that it's a free speech issue and opponents saying, no you are telling people how to make a gun.  </p><p>PATE:  Exactly and that's correct.  Under federal law. It is not illegal to publish blueprints for a firearm.  It is illegal to possess a firearm.  If it is a plastic firearm, it cannot be detected through metal detectors, radar devices, things of that nature.  But you can tell someone how to do it.  The concern here that the states have his look. We have no way of monitoring where these blueprints are going, you can have people overseas making these firearms.  You can have terrorist organizations now having access to the sensitive information.  The previously had been prohibited from released.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Page Pate, when does blueprints and instructions, basically, they are saying, this is how you make your -- when does that become the international distribution weapon on which there are treaties and international law requires when you disseminating firearms, basically. </p><p>[03:45:12] PATE:  That's the ultimate question and no court has made that decision yet.  The reason they were not able to publish this information initially was not because of federal firearm laws, but because of the release of technical information, so it was governed by totally different set of laws.  What the court will now have to decide, once this order reaches to the point where the judge has actually go through all the arguments.  The courts is going to have to decide exactly at what point are you possessing and distributing a firearm, is it when you publish the blueprints or when you actually use the 3-D printer to make the device.  </p><p>HOLMES:  This is the thing, isn't it?  I mean, whether it's a free speech issue and I'm just, you know, exercising my First Amendment rights and whether you are and you make the point of actually in particular, other countries was strict gun laws.  All of a sudden it's out there on the Internet.  It's everywhere so you can be in the country that is strict on laws and be making those in your garage and violating that country's law as well.  That is a responsibility there, surely for the U.S.  </p><p>PATE:  There's a responsibility, but the groups that are behind this, the people that are trying to publish this information they believe everyone should have a right to produce their own firearms. If you can afford the equipment to make it, then you are to have a right to do it.  </p><p>HOLMES:  What about the U.S.'s responsibility to other countries. </p><p>PATE:  Well, that's what started initially, the Obama administration was enforcing the restriction on allowing this sort of technical information to be distributed.  The Trump administration change all that.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Does that surprise you, I mean, because it is sort of like, I mean it makes you wonder why would the administration after years of successfully having hold of this, why would this administration say, yes, there is no problem with this.  </p><p>PATE:  Well, it doesn't make any sense and one of the main arguments that the states are making and the reason I think they got this Temporary Restraining Order, is they said the Trump administration didn't follow the rules.  You can't just willy-nilly change the requirements that you have that are already in place to prevent the release of this information.  You have to go through procedures.  You have to talk to Congress about it.  They didn't do that at all.  They just issued the settlement and said look, you can do it now where's you can do it before.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Do you wonder of the motivation for that?  Why do that?  I mean, the NRA has no problem with it.  A lot of suspicion is now that, you know the NRA pressure and all of a sudden the Trump administration, is he a taker?  </p><p>PATE:  It is possible.  I think we are going to find out a lot more about the motivation once we get into the litigation.  Remember, this is just pressing the pause button.  No judge has decided whether it's illegal or legal that is going to come much later.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Of course the issue too here, these were out there from, I think last Friday and by Sunday, I think 2 1/2 thousand or so had been downloaded.  The genie is out of the bottle, it is out there. You can't put it out.  </p><p>PATE:  You can't get it back.  So, what you can still do though is prohibit anyone from actually following through and making these weapons to the extent you can enforce it again with international concerns.  I don't know exactly how the U.S. government intends to enforce the laws that we do have about possessing and distributing the stock of firearms.  </p><p>HOLMES:  The things is a specious argument in many ways, the administration.  I think, one of the press secretary were saying but, the administration supports existing law that makes it illegal to own or make an untraceable gun.  Which would be, because it is made of plastic, but supporting that law, compared to outlawing the posting of plans.  I mean, it deals with the end product only, but if you're doing that the privacy of your own home for nefarious reasons, where is the responsibility of government to protect the person who might be on the wrong end of that gun.  </p><p>PATE:  That is the problem and we already had that in this country in second amendment issues with bump stocks.  I mean, you see this mass murders and you have law that prohibits someone from possessing and manufacturing an automatic weapon, but not this little device that can take a normal semi-automatic weapon and turn it into a machine gun. So, there's always this tension we have in interpreting the Second Amendment and also enforcing federal firearms laws and this is another area.  </p><p>HOLMES:  And bump stocks were outlawed after what happened in Las Vegas.  It didn't happen it, did it?  </p><p>PATE:  No.  Not yet.  What happened so far is ATF the agency that's charged with regulating that has now said we consider bump stocks to be part of an automatic weapons, we are not going to allow you to do it.  That's not a law.  This is just a regulation can be changed just like this.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Fascinating times.  Pate Page, always a pleasure.  Thanks for coming.  </p><p>PATE:  Thank you, Michael.  </p><p>HOLMES:  And now through a mystery in Germany three baby girls abandoned on the outskirts of Berlin over two year period.  Please say their mother is yet to be found could have use the safe and anonymous resource to drop her babies off for adoption if she wanted to, but she did not do that.

Here, a mother with unwanted pregnancy can anonymous deposit a newborn baby in the baby hatch.  There are dozens of baby hatches in Germany and also many hospitals like this one where a mother can deliver a baby anonymously. But police in Berlin are asking why neither possibility was used in the case of three abandoned babies also at the same mother.  </p><p>The first baby was left here at the bus stop just outside of hospital, next summer another child abandoned just a few minutes' drive away. And last year, the third baby was left outside of front door in this neighborhood, the children were taken into foster care.   This year police appealed to the public for information, bearing another child could be on the way, he distributed these photos of the baby clothes that were worn on the day they were abandoned, but no answers yet.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (TRANSLATOR):  We can only hope that any 4th child will be taken care of this officer says, left in a baby hatch or hospital so that the child can be helped as quickly as possible.  </p><p>SHUBERT:  At the hospital, doctor (inaudible) tells us that the baby hatch hasn't been used for at least two years and hopes the mother will know it is here for her to use.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (TRANSLATOR):  She want to for her baby to live, he says.  She wanted to be found quickly and for that reason no one should see her.  </p><p>SHUBERT:  A waiting box, a missing mother and a mystery still unsolved.

Now police say that claimed may had been a scam.  The process a special welcome home for Ms. Helen to tell all of this.  Stolen, shock and made it back safely to the Texas aquarium.  </p><p>[03:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>HOLMES:  Remember that sunken Russian warship rumored to have billions of gold.  The South Korean company that discovered it is now in hot water and questions are being raised about the ship itself. (Inaudible), explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The discovery of the century-old Russian warship and its treasure of gold.  A salvage team released this footage claiming he had found the final resting place of the Russian warship Dmitri Donskoy.  Solving a mystery that he alluded treasure hunters for decade.  But now, a new twist, South Korean police telling CNN. They are investigating the salvage company for fraud after it claimed it discovered boxes of gold on board the ship.  The Dmitri Donskoy was sunk after an attack by Japanese warships during the Japanese war 1905.  As she sank into the deep dark waters of the South Korean island of Lando.  She reportedly took with their incredible amount of gold.  If you believe scam reports, the total amount of gold bars and coins on board would today be worth more than $130 billion, that would be thousands of tons of gold all on board to pay for Russia's war effort against the Japanese.  </p><p>Now there is no shortage of treasure ship skeptics.  Why they asked, would Russia put so much gold on one ship and why put it on a ship at all.  It would have been safer to transfer the loot by rail to Russia's eastern city of Vladivostok.  The latest skeptic's South Korean police who have 14 people from the salvage company under a travel ban, as police investigate the latest twist to the century-old history.

I'm Michael Holmes, and this is CNN Newsroom.</p><p>Just months before millions of Americans both in congressional elections, Facebook uncovering what is believed to be a new and coordinated effort to spread disinformation. The social media giant has shut down dozens of fake accounts and pages with might have ties to Russian trolls.</p><p>Details now from CNN's Drew Griffin.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: Facebook causing inauthentic behavior and though Facebook can't be sure, it sure it looks like Russia again. Thirty two pages with names including 'Black Elevation,' 'Resisters,' 'Aztlan Warriors' being followed by 290,000 accounts.</p><p>The fake accounts also setting and promoting real events and protests aimed at further polarizing U.S. political discourse.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Many of the events did occur including this one last year in New York City attended by actual Americans who likely had no idea that the Resisters Facebook page was probably run Russians.</p><p>Another event by the same group was supposed to take place in a couple of weeks. Resisters set up a counter protest against white supremacist at the White House, August 10. Five other real groups signed on to participate.</p><p>As Facebook was announcing its crackdown on this potential Russian sites, the U.S. secretary of homeland security was at a cybersecurity conference saying there's no doubt meddled in the 2016 election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Everyone and everything is now a target.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: And Russian actors maybe added again, comparing the upcoming midterm elections to a looming storm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIELSEN: Today I believe the next major attack is more likely to reach us online than on an airplane. We are in a crisis mode that cat five hurricane has been forecast, and now we must prepare.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Facebook says these current pages all shut down at the hallmarks of the activities that Russians did around the presidential election, although there are some differences this time the pages didn't lead back to Russian I.P. addresses and they used third party services to buy ads to boost their post and encourage people to follow the pages.</p><p>As part of its new transparency policy, not only as Facebook announcing this publicly that it shut down these 32 suspected Russian sites, it is going to contact all 290,000 accounts that were in contact with these sites to let them know this were obviously face Facebook accounts.</p><p>Drew Griffin, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>HOLMES: And let's find out more on how Russia is responding to Facebook's move. CNN's Matthew Chance joining us now from Moscow. So, Facebook publicly saying it doesn't really know for sure who's buying it. But we're hearing that it's probably a Russian group and certainly the same sort of fingerprints. What's been the reaction there?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, the reaction, Michael, as you might expect from Russian authorities has been one of -- one of denial, instead, default stance whenever they're confronted with these kinds of allegations. They've denied any kind of hacking or attempting to intervene in the U.S. political workings of repeatedly since those allegations were first made.</p><p>Maria Zakharova who is the foreign ministry spokeswoman here in Moscow said it shows the evidence essentially and will comment on that.</p><p>But as of course, as you just reported, as you just heard Drew Griffin reports, the evidence that Facebook has by its own admission is not conclusive and it would require a sort of political assessment in order to point the finger of blame into Facebook have held back from doing that purposely, calling on the intelligence agencies to make an assessment, of course, U.S. politicians have pointed the finger at Russian.</p><p>[03:05:03] But because there is that small element of doubt that the evidence isn't entirely conclusive that will always give the Russians the ability to say no, it's not us. Michael?</p><p>HOLMES: And I guess, you know, and you're right. They can't point names, they can't say anything for certain but the fact that it is going on that disinformation it's widespread despite the publicity that as you said, members of Congress, if not the president speaking out. It just shows that whoever is doing it thinks it's working and it is worth it.</p><p>CHANCE: It would seem that way. I mean, look, if it is Russia, and of course Russia has a record of doing this, intelligence agencies in the United States have concluded that Russian did hacked and intervene and manipulate social media in order to, you know, meddle in U.S. politics in the past in the lead to the 2016 presidential election of course.</p><p>If it did do it, it's been sanctioned for it. A number of military intelligence GIU officers were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department just earlier this month.</p><p>And of course, there have been other sanctions put on the internet research agency which is St. Petersburg company with strong links to the Kremlin which is believed orchestrated the manipulation of social media from Russia in the lead up to that 2016 presidential race.</p><p>But clearly, that punishment of sanctions has not been enough to deter whoever is doing this from doing it again. Perhaps the reason for that, Michael, is because one of the objectives we've assessed for these internet hackers, et cetera, is to sow discord in western institutions.</p><p>And by backing these various political groups and these political rallies in the United States that result is achieved.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes, precisely. Matthew, thanks for that. Matthew Chance there in Moscow for us.</p><p>The first trial stemming from Robert Mueller's Russia investigation underway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Prosecutors urging jurors to, quote, \"follow the money\" as they lay out the allege financial crimes of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.</p><p>They say he lived an extravagant lifestyle avoiding taxes on millions in secret money from his lobbying work in Ukraine. Manafort's defense team pointing the finger at his deputy Rick Gates. He has pleaded guilty to several charges and he is cooperating with the government.</p><p>If convicted, Manafort faces a maximum 305 years in prison. Donald Trump tried to distance himself from Manafort, at least in public. But sources say he has requested frequent updates on the trial and spent part of Tuesday watching television coverage.</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta reports it may all be an effort to see how Robert Mueller's investigation could affect the president.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The recent pass to camera on his way to Florida President Trump appears to have a new strategy for the Russia investigation, ignore questions from reporters while spinning up a new defense where he shielded from outside scrutiny. Tweeting, \"collusion is not a crime.'</p><p>It's a notable leap from the president who has repeatedly claimed there was no collusion with the Russians during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no collusion, you know why? Because I don't speak to Russians.</p><p>There's been no collusion. There's been no crime. I can only say this, there was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it. Every committee.</p><p>There's no collusion. There was no collusion with Russia other than by the Democrats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: The president is now amplifying what his outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: I don't even know if that's a crime colluding about Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: And another Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM: Well, that's not just technically correct, it's actually the law. But there is no violation of law statute rule regulation that we have seen after reviewing this case for a year. And I think Bob Mueller will come to the same conclusion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: Democrats aren't buying it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: You can't keep up with Rudy Giuliani's theories of defense and they change almost by the hour. You know, collusion at one point it never happened. The next point if it happened it's not serious.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: Weighed down by the Russia probe, the president is turning to issues popular with his base, threatening to shut down the government to make Congress pay for a border wall, insisting that's a very price to pay. And tweeting, \"I don't care what the political ramifications are.\" Even fellow Republicans are leery of a shut down with the midterm elections fast approaching.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SCOTT TAYLOR (R), VIRGINIA: I kind of see this posturing, and to be honest with you, it's an irresponsible thing for to do I think.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: Mr. Trump's border policy is coming under increasing scrutiny with an administration official admitting to Congress that the president's practice of separating children from undocumented migrants amounts to child abuse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:09:59] JONATHAN WHITE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN'S PROGRAM, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: There's no question that separation of children from parents until significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: One of the president's fellow hardliners on immigration, Chief of Staff John Kelly appears to be sticking around. Sources confirmed the president has asked Kelly to remain at his post until 2020. Though CNN has learned the chief of staff wanted the story leaked to tamp down the reports that he could be on his way out.</p><p>Mr. Trump arrives in Florida with the upcoming elections on his mind, throwing a support behind GOP gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Build the wall.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He reads the stories.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then Mr. Trump said, you're fired.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: DeSantis appears in a new ad teaching his children how to build their own wall in a show of big league flattery. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Big league, so good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: CNN's Jim Acosta reporting there for us. President Trump meanwhile, standing most to that Florida campaign bragging about his economic accomplishments. But he also made this surprising prediction about Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Iran nuclear deal, it's a harrow show.</p><p>(CROWD BOOING)</p><p>TRUMP: I hope it works that well with Iran. They're having a lot of difficulty right now. I hope it works out well, and I have a feeling they'll be talking to us pretty soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Well, Tehran having none of that. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeting on Tuesday, quote, \"Iran and the U.S. had two years of talks. We produce the unique multilateral accord it's been working. U.S. can only blame itself for pulling out and leaving the table. Threats, sanctions, and P.R. stunt won't work. Try respect for Iranians and international commitments.\" End quote.</p><p>Well, in about an hour a former repatriation ceremony begins at Osan Air base in South Korea. Fifty five cases believed to contain the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean War being sent back to the U.S.</p><p>Paula Hancocks is at the air base and joins us now with the latest. An emotional and politically important day. Tell us how it's going to unfold.</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Michael. There will be a full honor ceremony for the remains that have been brought back from North Korea. Now they came back on Friday.</p><p>There's been a couple of days where forensic experts here at the Osan Air Base in South Korea have been shifting through those remains to try and ascertain whether or not what North Korea had said about them appears to be true.</p><p>We just had a press conference from the head of the DPAA, the Department for the Prisoners of War and the MIA that there's (Inaudible) of repatriation around the world that different combats learned. And they say that it appears that North Korea has been act to what it says certainly from the very initial look at them.</p><p>They say that they are all human remains. They say that they do appear to be remains from the Korean War. They also had one dog tag. This is the American I.D. that was within remains. They're already notified that family.</p><p>So, at least one family has some sense of closure for 65 years after the Korean War. And they say they'll be sending that dog tag to that family within this coming week.</p><p>Now also saying that alongside remains they found things like military hardware, helmets, boots, and other equipments, all very crucial in trying to find out what kind of nationalities they have within these remains.</p><p>Now there are many Americans still missing but of course there were 17 countries underneath the United Nations demand icing (Ph) during the Korean War, so it is possible that some of these remains maybe from other countries as well. Although initial assessments we're hearing today say that there are some Americans within there as well.</p><p>Now the U.S. also gave a quick press conference. An embassy official saying that no payment has been given for these remains. In the past there has been quid pro quo when it comes to North Korea giving up service members remains from the North Korea. But the U.S. says simply that has not happened this time around. Michael?</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Paula Hancocks there on the spot there for us. We'll in with you as they unfold. Thanks, Paula.</p><p>Meanwhile, some terrifying moments for passengers and crew on board a commercial flight that crashed in Mexico. I got images you seem them there. The smoldering wreckage from Aeromexico flight 2431, 49 people in hospital after the plane went down, this is after taking off from Durango.</p><p>The pilot and a passenger in critical condition. Now the aircraft was scheduled to fly to Mexico City but ended up in the field right near the runway. Hail and heavy rain were reported in the area not known if weather did in fact though contribute to the crash. Extraordinary no death reported.</p><p>All right. Coming up here on the program. Extreme weather not giving firefighters a break in California as they battle some of the most devastating wildfires the state has ever seen.</p><p>[03:15:05] Plus, the trade war between the U.S. and China, and the impact on your wallet. That's when we come back.</p><p>HOLMES: Apple's pricey iPhone came paying off for the tech giant. The thousand dollar phone boosted Apple's revenue 17 percent, pulling it more than, wait for it, $53 billion. Now that left the third-quarter profit of 11.5 billion and that is up 32 percent, even though Apple sold the same amount of iPhones it sold a year ago 41 million of them.</p><p>The strong earning sent Apple's stocks in after hours trading and put it closer to becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company worth a trillion dollars. And while Apple earn or enjoys its big earnings the trade was between the U.S. and China may soon be escalating. A source saying the Trump administration plans to raise pending tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent. But source says the move is not been finalized. It could as these things sometimes do, change.</p><p>Meanwhile, our Samuel Burke explains first how the trade war could affect big tech companies and consumers like you and me.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Trump's trade war is barreling towards Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are demanding fair and reciprocal trade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: The latest round of proposed tariffs targets the Chinese hardware, fueling the tech sector. Things like semiconductors and electronic circuits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSH KALLMER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL POLICY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL: There are certain kinds of machines that you and I never come into contact with. But that will underpin a lot of the high-tech products that people buy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: They are the key components that make smart devices, household appliances and home security systems hang.</p><p>Everyday items like the iPad could be hit, the tablet has a chip from Intel, which could be a target. These scooters have taken off this year. Now they faced a 25 percent tariff, even your favorite Netflix series could be in the firing line. The streaming companies videos are played from the Amazon cloud server and that equipment comes from China.</p><p>[03:19:55] Missing from the list the Apple iPhone. CEO Tim Cook told CNN in June he thought the device was safe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO: I don't think that iPhone will get a tariff on it is my belief based on what I've been told and in what I see I just don't see that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Now the president says he's ready to tax almost all Chinese imports, which would include the iPhone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: They went after our companies and they stole our intellectual property.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: The administration says the tariffs are meant to pressure China to fall in line. But experts say a (Inaudible) on the iPhone would be counterproductive. Even though the device is assembled in China it's designed and manufactured in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KALLMER: Ninety percent of that tariff falls on value created by Americans. It is -- there is no other way to say it and to say that literally the United States is taxing itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: And Apple may have the most to lose if China retaliates with tariffs of its own. Twenty one percent of the company sales are in China leaving a clear target on America's most valuable company.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>HOLMES: And the developing story we're following right now we're getting some official results of the first election in Zimbabwe since former President Robert Mugabe stepped down.</p><p>Zimbabwe's Electoral Commission reporting the governing Zanu-PF Party has won a majority in parliament with 109 seats. Now that of course was the party Mugabe helped create.</p><p>But on the eve of the vote he announced he wasn't going to vote for it. The main opposition securing 41 seats and other 58 yet to be declared.</p><p>Journalist Zenzele Ndebele joins us now on the phone from Zimbabwe to discuss this crucial election for a country once considered Africa's breadbasket.</p><p>Zenzele, first of all, how is this result likely to be received by the opposition. They were making noises earlier that they weren't happy with how the vote was unfolding.</p><p>ZENZELE NDEBELE, JOURNALIST: Yes. The opposition don't agreeing with the results. They think that they result was rigged. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is working with the ruling party to make sure that they don't win.</p><p>So even (Inaudible) the people projecting in the Harare, saying that they don't believe what came out of the result. I think it's going to be really a very serious in the next few days with the way the results are coming out. People are going to be disappointed because most of the opposition members they are expecting change.</p><p>I see them going into the street demonstrating (inaudible) that they can sustain the image because this is quite big victory for the Zanu- PF. I'm not sure whether they will really provide evidence that the result had been rigged because that is what is important.</p><p>And with all the 46 mission, observer mission from different countries, if the observer mission don't collaborate their side of the story that the election had been rigged then they will have a problem.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes, good point. When it comes to Zanu-PF and Robert Mugabe saying he wasn't going to vote for the party that he helped found, what are the challenges for the Zanu-PF there because there are still enormous economic issues and challenges facing Zimbabwe.</p><p>NDEBELE: Yes, I think, I mean, for some reason Zanu-PF rebranded themselves when they fired Robert Mugabe there were some people who were I mean, voting for Zanu-PF just because voting for Emmerson Mnangagwa just because he removed Robert Mugabe.</p><p>So I think that the removal of Mugabe was blissful for Zanu-PF and therefore put some reasoning. I mean, his -- Mugabe speech that he wasn't going to vote for Zanu will not affect Zanu-PF at all.</p><p>There are some people who thought that Mugabe this youth crowd that followed him and what he say is then going to be followed by (Inaudible). But this election clearly Zanu-PF is an institution and not an individual and the opposition have moved on to firing Robert Mugabe.</p><p>HOLMES: Interesting days ahead. Zenzele Ndebele, thank you so much for joining us there from Harare to talk about this. I appreciate it.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters slowly making progress against deadly wildfires ravaging California, but the weather doing them no favors. Extreme heat, strong winds forecast for this week could spread the flames even further.</p><p>Have a look at that video there. The largest fire the so-called Carr Fire is now the seventh most destructive in California's history. Thirty percent contained we're told, 30 percent. At least six people have died in that fire, four others are missing.</p><p>Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri is at the CNN weather center, he joins us now with more on the weather conditions affecting those fires up. Yes, I mean, what do we say this, seventh largest in history for California but most of the biggest ones in the top 10 had been in the recent years, haven't they?</p><p>[03:24:59] PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Absolutely. And you know, in fire records I'll go back to the 1920s in California. In fact, you can look at that and 8 of the top 10 have happened since the 2000. So, it kind of, another way to look at it of how frequent this has been happening in recent years.</p><p>And of course the persistent broad air is in high pressure, the persistent drought, the extreme heat, all of them playing a role into exacerbating the problem. And down at the ground level we'll certainly see gusty winds here and extreme temperatures. Unfortunately, that pattern it looks to continue a couple more days. But, finally, if we're going to see a shift here for the better, and really seeing how extensive this has been.</p><p>Because one way to look at how explosive of a fire weather pattern we had is that, look at the peak of this particular fire, the Carr Fire. We had at one point 11 hectares per minute of land being consumed across this region.</p><p>Another way to look at that is think about every three seconds. The size of a football field being consumed by wildfires. That's what was happening here in Northern California in the last couple of days and conditions have remained, so unsettled with the dry condition but even in the last 24 hours as we talked to you yesterday.</p><p>The active fires across the western U.S. have gone from 90 to almost 100 now. So we're still seeing additional fires popping up across this region, and of course the gusty wind, the extreme heat is not helping out the forecast --</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: Welcome back, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. Time to update you on the top stories this hour. 49 people in hospital in Mexico after an aero Mexico flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Durango. The pilot and the passenger in critical condition. The plane was scheduled to fly to Mexico City. It had 101 people on board. It was hail and heavy rain in the area around the time of the crash. Not known, however, whether that factor. Incredibly no deaths.</p><p>Prosecutors are laying out their case against the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. They say he avoided paying taxes on millions earned through lobbying work in Ukraine. The defense pointing the finger at Manafort's former Deputy, Rick Gates, who is working with prosecutors.</p><p>Facebook shutting down dozens of pages and accounts with could be link to Russia, and may have blew it hundreds of thousands of followers. The social media giant says it identified a new and coordinated U.S. effort to interfere in U.S. politics and mislead American voters ahead of November's congressional election.</p><p>A CNN political analyst Brian Karem joins me now from Washington, he is also the executive editor of the Sentinel newspaper. Good to see you, Brian.</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Good to see you, Michael. How are you doing?</p><p>HOLMES: Doing well. I guess it is no surprise that this is still happening, because by all accounts it works so well the last time. Facebook says it is doing what it can, what about the reaction of the Trump administration? KAREM: Well, the Trump administration reaction to this issue has been muted at best. He has -- the president is kind of confuse the two issues. He doesn't want to really admit there is a problem, because he so busy defending himself against charges of collusion that to admit that the Russians in any way help them. He doesn't want to face that possibility, or that or the reality of that and so while he's talking about collusion, he is ignoring the fact that the simple fact that the last election was affected by Russian trolls that are added again and were inadequately prepared for it. And so he's left the preparation for this up to the states and up to the Senate and up to Congress to do something about it and without leadership from the top is questionable as to whether or not it will effectively be able to head this off to the passes were doing about it in every situation.</p><p>HOLMES: Do you think that is the president's sensitivity about the election, I mean, he just does not want for his presidency to be seen as illegitimate in any way and by giving credence to all of this. What impact that the interference had which clearly was significant. By giving that credence. He's hurting his own credibility in a way of legitimacy is that the problem, so therefore the problem are being tackled.</p><p>KAREM: Well, his credibility and his legitimacy is up for debate on any given day for a number of reasons, of which this is just merely one. It's isn't but the heart of the issue is an outside country tampering with and influencing the elections of the largest democracy on the planet and undermining the very foundations of our Republic and you have to address that for a country to be legitimate. It's its elections have to be so and we have in this country sent a, you know, to different countries to oversee their elections to make sure they're legitimate and so are we going to now have to have people from the United Nations come to the United States and oversee hours. That's the scary prospect of it. How serious is this?</p><p>We won't really know until someone in this administration and the administration as a whole takes it as seriously as we all know it to be. The Facebook is taking it more seriously than he is.</p><p>HOLMES: Well, I was just going to say, even there assigned to the problem clearly is difficult to spot and stop. Is the country able to stop this sort of interference? It's not -- it's not hard to set up a Facebook page and start agitating.</p><p>KAREM: Well, yes, and agitation is one thing, manipulation of elections is another. And yes, the agitation that the agitation is real. The trolls on the twitter trolls and the Facebook trolls are all real and they're all setting out what he calls fake news and that is influencing, you know, voters. So, you have to really kind of -- two different things working with our elections. The direct interference in hacking of election sites and election machinery and then the influence of those who do vote by the trolls. The Russian trolls on Facebook and twitter and those of the two issues that we have to face as voters in this country.</p><p>[03:35:15] HOLMES: Yes, and I guess the extent of it is pretty clear that Facebook saying more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspects pages, that is a lot of followers. In recent weeks, of course there has been other aspects of meddling, you know, of this report that Claire McCaskill, Senate Democrats --</p><p>KAREM: The right.</p><p>HOLMES: There were attempting to hack her as well. So, were not just talking social media and you mentioned polling machines as well.</p><p>KAREM: Yes. You know, you have to remember the history of this country goes back to the hanging chad elections with George W. Bush and you know we didn't want mechanical counting of the elections we wanted it more streamlined, more efficient, because of what happened there, but when you go to the electronic counting when you go to be able to count your votes and then get on the Internet, you know with the same machine, you're gonna have trouble and so were finding that perhaps maybe the old-fashioned paper ballot that is in such a bad idea after all.</p><p>You rather have a hanging chad then have hanging elections. It's going to be very difficult to sort this all out. It is very difficult for electors and you have to remember that in this country, you know the elections are run by precinct captains, they are run by counties and states, and so each state has different machinery. Sometimes different counties have different machinery, sometimes different precincts have different machinery and if you're able to get online with that machinery and count the votes then someone is going to be only get online and hack those machines. And that's what happened previously.</p><p>So, when you put together the Facebook trolls that the Internet trolls, influencing legitimate votes with a lot of fake news and stuff, but you know, honestly, is a legitimate and then you have that compounded by those who go and hack the machinery, it's hard to tell exactly how much of the Russian trolls have affected our elections and we do know that they have.</p><p>HOLMES: Just before I let you go. It's quite -- it was quite a depressing picture that you paint there, we got the midterm elections coming up obviously crucial elections for the Trump administration and for the Democrats.</p><p>KAREM: Yes.</p><p>HOLMES: I mean, how do you feel? Do you have confidence in how those elections will go?</p><p>KAREM: Good question. I have hope that will go well. I do know that there are people in Congress, the Senate and in Maryland at the state level in other states, Missouri, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, has spoken with people there who are working hard to make sure and ensuring that the election is legitimate, but there are 50 states in this grand and glorious union. There are a lot of precincts and there are a lot of machines, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. So the best I can do is hope and I hope that the people in office care more about the election results and the legitimacy of the election over their own party and it will make the right decision. Now, that I do have faith then, but the machinery, I have faith in people machinery not so much.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. You're right, each state and different precincts have different systems are being concern here in the state of Georgia, about the machines as well. Brian, good to see you, Brian Karem. I appreciate it.</p><p>KAREM: Thank you.</p><p>HOLMES: The Philippine president, Rodrigo Detective, is not afraid to show criminals he means business and to prove his point, he oversaw this, the destruction of dozens of luxury cars, we are talking Lamborghinis, Porsche, Mustangs, and all of them had been smuggled into the country. And so, this happened. It is a tactic he has used before as part of his anticorruption campaign sending a very visual message like bulldozers crushing $5 million worth of cars.</p><p>It is latest target in the gun-control battle coming up, as jobs full to log on plans for 3-D printable guns going online, for now.</p><p>Plus, three newborn babies abandoning Germany over two year period. Police trying to track down their mother. We will be right back.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: Welcome back. If you try hailing a taxi in major cities across Spain, you might be out of luck. Taxi drivers in Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere have been on strike blocking streets to pressure the government to restrict licenses for Uber and similar services. Driver say the ridesharing apps are making it impossible for them to compete union and government officials met Monday they for them to compete. Union and government officials met Monday, they were unable to reach a deal.</p><p>Blueprints for building your own gun at home with a 3-D printer are on hold, at least for now, the U.S. judge temporarily blocking a website from posting the plans, the government recently reached a settlement to allow a gun rights group called Defense Distributed to post the plans online, but then states file suit to preventive it. And they got a Temporary Restraining Order. Both sides go back to court August 10 to argue the next steps. The founder of Defense Distributed told CNN's Laurie Segall, him, it is a freedom of speech issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CODY WILSON, FOUNDER DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED: I already uploads the plans, I mean, ship to sell, it is (inaudible) information now. It is regrettable, no one can take it back.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: The democratization of guns online giving people the ability to 3d print their own gun would make it feasible for felons, minors, mentally ill, to have access of firearms. Are you worried about those repercussions?</p><p>WILSON: No, I don't believe the access information is ever tremendously negative or that thing. I know that people can use information for bad things. But this is a justification to what stop a publisher from speaking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Our CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Page Pate, joins me now here on set always a pleasure, sir. Good to see you.</p><p>PAGE PATE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Great to be here.</p><p>HOLMES: This is a Temporary Restraining Order, blocking it being on the internet. What does that mean in a legal sense in terms of this going forward?</p><p>PATE: Well, basically means that a federal judge looked at this lawsuit that was filed by a number of different states and said there's enough here for me to put a stop to this now. So that we can later argue about the real issues and whether this particular entity has a constitutional right to publish this material, or whether the government has a more important right to stop the publishing of these blueprints.</p><p>HOLMES: That is interesting, because their argument. The ones you want to stop out there. Their argument is that it's a free speech issue and opponents saying, no you are telling people how to make a gun.</p><p>PATE: Exactly and that's correct. Under federal law. It is not illegal to publish blueprints for a firearm. It is illegal to possess a firearm. If it is a plastic firearm, it cannot be detected through metal detectors, radar devices, things of that nature. But you can tell someone how to do it. The concern here that the states have his look. We have no way of monitoring where these blueprints are going, you can have people overseas making these firearms. You can have terrorist organizations now having access to the sensitive information. The previously had been prohibited from released.</p><p>HOLMES: Page Pate, when does blueprints and instructions, basically, they are saying, this is how you make your -- when does that become the international distribution weapon on which there are treaties and international law requires when you disseminating firearms, basically.</p><p>[03:45:12] PATE: That's the ultimate question and no court has made that decision yet. The reason they were not able to publish this information initially was not because of federal firearm laws, but because of the release of technical information, so it was governed by totally different set of laws. What the court will now have to decide, once this order reaches to the point where the judge has actually go through all the arguments. The courts is going to have to decide exactly at what point are you possessing and distributing a firearm, is it when you publish the blueprints or when you actually use the 3-D printer to make the device.</p><p>HOLMES: This is the thing, isn't it? I mean, whether it's a free speech issue and I'm just, you know, exercising my First Amendment rights and whether you are and you make the point of actually in particular, other countries was strict gun laws. All of a sudden it's out there on the Internet. It's everywhere so you can be in the country that is strict on laws and be making those in your garage and violating that country's law as well. That is a responsibility there, surely for the U.S.</p><p>PATE: There's a responsibility, but the groups that are behind this, the people that are trying to publish this information they believe everyone should have a right to produce their own firearms. If you can afford the equipment to make it, then you are to have a right to do it.</p><p>HOLMES: What about the U.S.'s responsibility to other countries.</p><p>PATE: Well, that's what started initially, the Obama administration was enforcing the restriction on allowing this sort of technical information to be distributed. The Trump administration change all that.</p><p>HOLMES: Does that surprise you, I mean, because it is sort of like, I mean it makes you wonder why would the administration after years of successfully having hold of this, why would this administration say, yes, there is no problem with this.</p><p>PATE: Well, it doesn't make any sense and one of the main arguments that the states are making and the reason I think they got this Temporary Restraining Order, is they said the Trump administration didn't follow the rules. You can't just willy-nilly change the requirements that you have that are already in place to prevent the release of this information. You have to go through procedures. You have to talk to Congress about it. They didn't do that at all. They just issued the settlement and said look, you can do it now where's you can do it before.</p><p>HOLMES: Do you wonder of the motivation for that? Why do that? I mean, the NRA has no problem with it. A lot of suspicion is now that, you know the NRA pressure and all of a sudden the Trump administration, is he a taker?</p><p>PATE: It is possible. I think we are going to find out a lot more about the motivation once we get into the litigation. Remember, this is just pressing the pause button. No judge has decided whether it's illegal or legal that is going to come much later.</p><p>HOLMES: Of course the issue too here, these were out there from, I think last Friday and by Sunday, I think 2 1/2 thousand or so had been downloaded. The genie is out of the bottle, it is out there. You can't put it out.</p><p>PATE: You can't get it back. So, what you can still do though is prohibit anyone from actually following through and making these weapons to the extent you can enforce it again with international concerns. I don't know exactly how the U.S. government intends to enforce the laws that we do have about possessing and distributing the stock of firearms.</p><p>HOLMES: The things is a specious argument in many ways, the administration. I think, one of the press secretary were saying but, the administration supports existing law that makes it illegal to own or make an untraceable gun. Which would be, because it is made of plastic, but supporting that law, compared to outlawing the posting of plans. I mean, it deals with the end product only, but if you're doing that the privacy of your own home for nefarious reasons, where is the responsibility of government to protect the person who might be on the wrong end of that gun.</p><p>PATE: That is the problem and we already had that in this country in second amendment issues with bump stocks. I mean, you see this mass murders and you have law that prohibits someone from possessing and manufacturing an automatic weapon, but not this little device that can take a normal semi-automatic weapon and turn it into a machine gun. So, there's always this tension we have in interpreting the Second Amendment and also enforcing federal firearms laws and this is another area.</p><p>HOLMES: And bump stocks were outlawed after what happened in Las Vegas. It didn't happen it, did it?</p><p>PATE: No. Not yet. What happened so far is ATF the agency that's charged with regulating that has now said we consider bump stocks to be part of an automatic weapons, we are not going to allow you to do it. That's not a law. This is just a regulation can be changed just like this.</p><p>HOLMES: Fascinating times. Pate Page, always a pleasure. Thanks for coming.</p><p>PATE: Thank you, Michael.</p><p>HOLMES: And now through a mystery in Germany three baby girls abandoned on the outskirts of Berlin over two year period.

''But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The statement followed a lengthy Op-Ed by Mr. Hughes published online Thursday morning arguing that the social media giant be subjected to extensive government oversight and separated into multiple companies, notably by spinning off the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messenger service WhatsApp. The essay will appear in print on Sunday.</p><p>  Mr. Hughes was a co-founder of Facebookwith <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>15 years ago when they were undergraduates at Harvard. He left the company in 2007 to work with the Obama campaign and more recently has focused on the issue of income inequality. In the essay, he said repeatedly that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is a good, kind person but simply has too much power for any one individual.</p><p>  ''The government must hold Mark accountable,'' Mr. Hughes wrote in the 5,800-word column, arguing that the social media giant has grown far too powerful.</p><p>  ''From our earliest days, Mark used the word 'domination' to describe our ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility,'' he wrote. ''Over a decade later, Facebookhas earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.''</p><p>  [Read Chris Hughes's argument for breaking up Facebook.]</p><p>  Though others have made similar arguments over the past year, the essay by a longtime confidant of Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>drew intense interest, given Mr. Hughes's role in the start of the company and his once close-knit relationship with Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg.</nameText></person></p><p>  Naturally, the debate also played out on Facebookitself and other social media platforms. Some said Mr. Hughes's argument rang hollow because he had made hundreds of millions of dollars from Facebook. Others said that a breakup would not fix the core issues posed by a few companies with so much power over the flow of information.</p><p>  The specific prescription Mr. Hughes offered was government intervention. He wrote that the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department ''should enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several years.'' He called the decision to allow Facebookto buy these two major competitors ''the F.T.C.'s biggest mistake.''</p><p>  He also argued that simply breaking up Facebookwould not be sufficient. ''We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies,'' he wrote, saying that ''its first mandate should be to protect privacy.''</p><p>  One person who embraced the essay was Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has made the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon a cornerstone of her presidential campaign. She  expressed  her support on Twitter and on Medium.</p><p>  ''Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector,'' Ms. Warren wrote. ''Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new start-ups to compete with these big tech companies because it's so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business.''</p><p>  Tim Wu, a professor of antitrust law at Columbia Law School and the author of ''The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,'' also applauded the proposal. ''It would be part of an American tradition of breaking up some of the largest tech companies that has produced positive results,'' he said.</p><p>  He pointed to the case of AT&amp;T, the telephone monopoly that was disassembled into eight smaller companies in 1984. ''A lot of what we now call the internet revolution was a byproduct of the breakup,'' he said.</p><p>  But Kent Lassman, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said industry-specific regulations can backfire. Established business interests will use them to ward off competition, he said. ''It is absurd for innovative companies to require constant permission from regulators like the F.T.C. to adapt to a dynamic market.''</p><p>  As a practical matter, a Facebook breakup won't happen anytime soon, said Bill Kovacic, a professor of global competition at George Washington Law School. He said Facebookcould argue that it had grown WhatsApp and Instagram into successful businesses with satisfied customers: ''How do we know they would have turned out to be an independent and effective competitor?''</p><p>  He said that Mr. Hughes's essay ''dramatically underestimates the difficulty for the government to prevail in such a case.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-022349190510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2Y-3G51-JBG3-64WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/facebook-response-chris-hughes.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/facebook-response-chris-hughes.html</url><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was a stark contrast between the relatively defensive attitude on display in the hearings and the more contrite and proactive approach indicated by Facebook's earnings call. The social networking company seems far more willing so far than others to put real money behind its efforts to ensure undue political influence is curbed, for better or worse.Political Fallout Remains UnclearThis week's hearings were certainly uncomfortable for the representatives (mostly lawyers) sent by the big tech companies to testify in front of Congressional committees. </p><p>They were on the receiving end of frustrated chastisement from lawmakers, and though they defended and dodged as best they could, they still likely came away licking their wounds. But it's still far from clear what if any action Congress might take as a result of these hearings \u00e2euro;ldquo; the threats have been general and fairly vague rather than specific enough to warrant real concern on the part of the tech companies. Certainly, none of those tech companies should consider itself immune from political fallout given the growing unease about their role from both the political right (over perceived bias) and the left (over antitrust and related issues). But for now they may well escape any concrete attempts at additional regulation given their commitments to increased transparency and reporting around political advertising and the like.Facebook's Response Stands OutThough the attitude demonstrated by Facebook in the hearings wasn't markedly different from that of its peers, its earnings call on Wednesday certainly stood out from the others held by the tech companies appearing before Congress this week. Whereas the others have largely downplayed the financial impact of the current political quagmire in which they find themselves stuck, Facebook's leadership made a proactive commitment to trying to solve the problem: it committed to spending enough additional money on 'security' in the coming months to have a material impact on its profitability going forward. What's interesting here is that there is no immediate pressure on Facebook to take these steps, and the decision to take them seems motivated as much by Mark Zuckerberg's recent conversion to a more responsible and community-centric strategy for Facebook as by any political imperative. The CEO has been through such an abrupt about-face on the issue of Facebook's role in political meddling over the past year that it's almost as if he's a different person from the one who reacted dismissively to suggestions fake news on his platform might have played a role in the outcome of the 2016 elections. That community-orientedness was evident not only in the security commitments but also in Zuckerberg's comments on Wednesday's call about making interaction on Facebook more meaningful \u00e2euro;ldquo; an attempt to return to the company's roots as a social network rather than the content hub it's become in recent years. And of course all of this builds on the company's new mission announced earlier this year to focus on community building and bringing people closer together.People and Technology but no Change in Business ModelFacebook's approach to solving what it frames as the security issue involves both people and technology: Facebook will double its ten thousand strong moderation team (many of them likely outside contractors) in the coming year, but will also continue to apply its AI and machine learning skills to the challenge. The cost of additional employees and contractors will therefore have by far the biggest financial impact on the company. But one thing the company is notably not proposing to do is change its business model, which is interesting because it's that business model that's been at the root of the company's problems with regard to political interference. Making its platforms far less open, and its algorithms more tightly controlled would certainly do a great deal to mitigate election meddling, but it would also have a massive effect on its top line, which continues to grow rapidly despite its dire warnings over the past year of coming slowdowns. Facebook says that the investments it will make will precede the improvements to the user experience and therefore healthier user and revenue growth in the longer term, but that the latter will come eventually. However, there's a real risk that all the dollars it spends on neutralizing political criticism with stronger moderation and smarter AI don't really solve these business model-driven problems and leave it both poorer and in the same place politically as it is now, while big competitors like Google and Twitter try to ride out the political turmoil without making such drastic changes. Facebook is here putting its investors' money where Mark Zuckerberg's mouth is \u00e2euro;ldquo; there was a palpable sense of disappointment at the financial commitment being made here among financial analysts on its earnings call, though also some acknowledgment that the moves might be necessary. The risk here will be borne by those investors, while the upside is still far from clear, and the real motivation seems to be a personal desire from Zuckerberg to feel better about the role his platform plays in the world. The next few months may alternatively demonstrate his wisdom in taking these bold steps or reveal them to be misguided and expensive. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCHP1289261509640859308251761300096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHP-128926</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVW-FP91-JCMN-Y4T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tech.pinions</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 2, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook said the Access Act is a positive initial move in the right direction. The bill would mandate that big tech firms allow their users to simply transmit their information to different platforms.   Data portability, for its part, has been an essential part in the conversation over antitrust domestically and in Europe.   Facebook indicated in April that it ultimately aspires to let users transition important information like friend lists and contacts onto a different platform in a manner that safeguards privacy.   The news comes as Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, testified before the FTC as part of the organization\u2019s antitrust probe into the social media company.   It is not known what the chief executive discussed during his digital testimony over two days, however the testimony reportedly indicates that the agency is proceeding with the probe it opened last summer.   Joe Osborne , a Facebook representative, said per a report that the firm is \u201ccommitted to cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s inquiry and answering the questions the Agency may have.\u201d   In other news, the  U.S. Department of Justice  (DOJ) is proceeding with its probe into Big Tech firms based on antitrust complaints per Deputy Attorney General  Jeff Rosen as noted by Reuters .   \u201cWe are going full-tilt,\u201d Rosen said per Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a major priority. We have a great team working really hard to get on top of the documents, hearing from people in the industry and the like.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS REPORT: THE FI\u2019S GUIDE TO MODERNIZING DIGITAL PAYMENTS       Instant payouts have become the name of the game for vendors and suppliers facing crumbling revenue streams, but banks can find themselves struggling to facilitate faster B2B payments. In this month\u2019s The FI\u2019s Guide to Modernizing Digital Payments, PYMNTS talks to Vikram Dewan, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief information officer , about how regulatory compliance complicates payments digitization \u2014 and why change must begin with shifting away from paper.

We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.\"</p><p/><p>During its Q3 earnings call, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>announced that the company plans to double the number of employees working on safety and security from 10,000 to 20,000. However, these numbers also include third-party contractors, and not just full-time <url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/russian-ads-influence-2016-election-1202604650/\">Facebook</url> employees. The company ended September with\u00a023,165 employees.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>made these remarks as Facebookhandily beat analysts' estimates of its earnings. Facebookgenerated $10.33 billion in revenue during its third quarter, compared to $7 billion during the same quarter last year. The company's net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion, compared to $2.4 billion a year ago. This equals diluted earnings of $1.59 per share, up from $0.90 last year.</p><p/><p>Analysts had expected $9.88 billion in revenue, and a net profit of $1.29 per share.</p><p/><p>Facebookalso continued to grow its user base, attracting some\u00a01.37 billion daily active users on average in September, compared to\u00a01.18 billion a year ago. Monthly active users reached\u00a02.07 billion by the end of September. The company said that it now generates 88 percent of its advertising revenue from mobile ads, compared to 84 percent during the same quarter last year.</p><p/><p>Facebookstill makes the vast majority of its money with advertising - more than 98 percent of the Q3 revenue came from ads, to be precise. However, the \"payments and other fees segment\" had its first sequential growth in the last 6 quarters. This could be an indicator that the company's Oculus VR headset is finally seeing some growing sales.</p><p/><p>Coincidentally, FacebookCFO David Wehner called out virtual and augmented reality as one of three factors driving up costs in 2018. The other two major investment areas would be safety and video content.\u00a0\"We are investing aggressively in video content to seed our watch tab,\" he said. Altogether, investments are expected to grow by 45-60 percent year-over-year next year, Wehner said.\u00a0\"It is shaking up to be a significant investment year.\"</p><p/><p>Facebook's earnings release happened to come during a week of intense hearings on Capitol Hill on the role big tech companies played in Russia's attempts to undermine the 2016 election.
