The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX8-WKW1-DYNP-M044-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXJ-HX31-DYNP-M2NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible.

However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWY-RB01-JC6M-X0W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXB-BY61-DYNP-M1CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWR-S431-JC6M-X3HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWX-DKN1-JC6M-X4TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX2-XGF1-DYNP-M3DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX4-CT41-JC6M-X1H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>\u200b (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>\u200b is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes \u2018reliable evidence.\u2019</p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI\u2019s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational \u2018meta-science\u2019 that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research \u2013 which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification \u2013 to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study \u2013 and patient identification \u2013 allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes?\u200b\u00a0</p><p>PR:\u200b Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a \u2018learning health care system,\u2019 whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only \u2018data liquidity\u2019 but also \u2018evidence liquidity\u2019 that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWP-Y671-JC6M-X2V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXS-9921-JC6M-X2NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible.

However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>\u200b (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>\u200b is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes \u2018reliable evidence.\u2019</p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI\u2019s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational \u2018meta-science\u2019 that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research \u2013 which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification \u2013 to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study \u2013 and patient identification \u2013 allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies?\u200b</p><p>PR:\u200b Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look?

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWV-Y8N1-DYNP-M1GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXP-V1B1-JC6M-X1CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The event discussed the opportunities and challenges of health care in the era of big data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2018/12/05/To-access-the-rewards-of-big-data-in-health-care-potential-risks-must-be-managed?utm_source=copyright&amp;utm_medium=OnSite&amp;utm_campaign=copyright\">To access the rewards of big data in health care, potential risks must be managed</url></p><p>To further discuss the issue, Outsourcing-Pharma (OSP) caught up with Dr. Patrick Ryan (PR), head, epidemiology analytics, Janssen R&amp;D, office of the chief medical officer, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p> OSP: What are the key ethical concerns of integrating big data into the health care landscape? </p><p>PR:  Generating reliable evidence to inform future clinical practice based on the past experience of patients is essential to advancing better health outcomes. However, we need to do this in a manner that protects patient privacy and respects the interests of those who contribute to the data collection or could be impacted by the data use.\u00a0</p><p>In the context of observational data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, a strategy that is used by groups such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ohdsi.org/\">OHDSI</url>  (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdassentinelinitiative/ucm2007250.htm\">FDA-Sentinel</url>  is to establish data networks that conduct analysis using a distributed model, whereby patient-level data are maintained securely behind the firewalls of the data-holding organization and only aggregate summary statistics are shared between participating sites.\u00a0</p><p>A counter-balancing concern is ensuring the reliability of the evidence generated from observational data. Consensus on proper standards for evidence quality has not been established, which raises questions of how evidence generated from observational data should be integrated with evidence from other sources, including weighing against evidence from randomized clinical trials.</p><p>To address this, some have expressed a desire to ensure data provenance and auditing through source record adjudication, which is not always possible. Further, if centralization of data were required, it could potentially compromise patient privacy.\u00a0</p><p> OSP: How are these being addressed? And what are the main challenges? </p><p>PR:  A key challenge is achieving consensus across scientific disciplines (epidemiology, statistics, medical informatics, clinical sciences) and stakeholders (industry, regulatory agencies, health systems, academia) for what constitutes  reliable evidence. </p><p>That consensus is a necessary pre-requisite before determining appropriate governance for how and when these observational data can be used by which analytical methods to meet the scientific needs of the community.</p><p>To address this challenge, OHDSI has developed an open-science community that allows academia, industry, and government to collaborate in the design and conduct of observational analyses across its international network of databases.\u00a0</p><p>It is also conducting methodological research that aims to empirically evaluate analytical methods and data standards to quantify the reliability of evidence generated using alternative approaches.</p><p>Janssen contributes to OHDSI s research agenda, because it recognizes the need to perform this foundational  meta-science  that can be used to establish scientific best practices that can be consistently implemented for specific clinical questions of interest.</p><p> OSP: Specifically, what considerations must be taken into account to navigate recruitment and consent? </p><p>PR:  Retrospective data analysis of de-identified patient-level data requires different governance structures from prospective data collection in the context of clinical research   which requires informed consent.\u00a0</p><p>Observational data can be used to support clinical research in the following ways: First, they can support clinical trial design to ensure that studies are feasible and sufficiently generalizable to be informative.</p><p>Second, they can be used for site identification   to find the providers who may be interested in engaging in clinical research because they treat patients who would qualify for a given study   and patient identification   allowing for authorized clinicians to raise awareness of patients of their opportunities to participate in clinical research for which they may qualify if they are interested.\u00a0</p><p>Note that the ability to identify sites and patients is limited to the providers of the data, e.g., a health insurance company, and is not available to end users who pay a fee to access these datasets.</p><p> OSP: How has the entrance of new players (from tech, etc.) created a period of disruption? </p><p>PR:  New players have introduced exciting innovations in data collection platforms, data aggregation systems, and analytic ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>Technological advances, coupled with scientific progress across multiple disciplines, have enabled analyses to be designed and executed by a broader community, with new technical infrastructures making it feasible to conduct large-scale analyses at a more reasonable cost point.</p><p>These advances are also introducing opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of analyses performed beyond what was imaginable less than a decade ago.</p><p> OSP: How is the pharma industry working with these companies? </p><p>PR:  Pharma is partnering with big tech to learn about innovations in technical infrastructure, analytical solutions, and novel scientific approaches, and actively applying these new technologies to attempt to advance their data science capabilities and expand the role of data to inform their decision-making.</p><p>Another innovation is to make data collection more patient-centric. In this model, patients are asked to consent to providing access to all of their medical records and claims, and may also get asked to complete questionnaires, e.g., on symptoms they may be experiencing (which are not generally available in any of the otherwise available data sources). These systems also provide patients with access to their own data in a useable form.</p><p> OSP: Looking ahead, five, ten years, how do you expect the industry to look? What may be some of the biggest changes? \u00a0</p><p>PR:  Over the next 10 years, I expect we will finally realize the untapped potential of a  learning health care system,  whereby data captured during the course of routine clinical practice can be continuously used to generate evidence that can directly inform future clinical practice.</p><p>The data captured will be systemically used to characterize disease and treatment utilization patterns, to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of alternative medical interventions, and to learn patient-level prediction models that allow for personalized medicine and disease interception.</p><p>I hope we will see greater international collaboration across industry, academia, and government, so that learnings from one organization or health system can be proactively used to inform policy and care decisions around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Technology will enable not only  data liquidity  but also  evidence liquidity  that will more seamlessly fill the current gaps in our understanding of the effects of medical interventions and encourage greater dissemination of real-world evidence so that clinicians and patients can be more informed and empowered in their shared decision-making.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OUTPHR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OUTPHR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXC-07K1-JC6M-X3B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1239\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

The new law is intended to update existing European copyright rules for the internet age, but tech companies and free speech advocates have voiced concern that the directive will negatively limit the way content on the internet is moderated and disseminated online, chilling free speech, making digital content harder to find and disenfranchising smaller businesses who can\u2019t afford to comply with the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advocates of the directive, though, argue the requirements will give publishers and content creators more control over their work and allow them to reap the financial rewards of their content when it\u2019s disseminated across the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ongoing discussion and protests around the bill\u2019s passage have been contentious, and a Change.org petition opposing the directive has collected more than 5 million signatures as of today.</p><p>Policy experts expect the rules will have consequences around the world.</p><p>\u201cThe EU is, for better or for worse, a global standard-setter on internet policy,\u201d said Raegan MacDonald, the head of EU public policy for the open-source software company Mozilla, which opposes the new rules. \u201c \u2026 I don\u2019t think it will be long until it comes to the U.S., and the way the EU and the U.S. have been looking at the tech-lash and examining the responsibility of platforms, the discussions are actually quite similar.\u201d</p><p>The EU Copyright Directive is a series of rules aimed at updating copyright regulation to account for the digital age. In broad terms, the rules are intended to give copyright holders, like publishers and content creators, more control over how their content is used across the internet and provide more ways to earn money from their content. It\u2019ll also expand the ways some content can be used for educational and cultural purposes.</p><p>Two portions of the directive in particular\u2014Article 11 and Article 17, previously numbered Article 13\u2014have drawn the greatest deal of attention and scrutiny. Article 11 will require web platforms and news aggregation services to pay publishers when they aggregate small portions of their content in search results, a policy that\u2019s been referred to as a \u201clink tax.\u201d</p><p>The other, Article 17, holds for-profit platforms accountable for copyright-infringing content that appears on their sites. In practice, it will likely mean companies would have to implement a screening process before content can live on their platforms, much like YouTube\u2019s Content ID upload filter, which checks for copyrighted music and other assets prior to upload.</p><p>Legislators supportive of the articles say that the law will make the internet fairer by ensuring that content creators are compensated when their content is used and aggregated, and by requiring tech platforms to ensure that content they profit from is not infringing copyright. People opposing the directive are much less optimistic, saying the bill will limit the spread of information, chill free speech and prevent small platforms from competing with the established tech giants.</p><p>Media associations and groups that represent big publishers operating in the EU have expressed support for the finalized text, and are particularly enthusiastic about Article 11, which they say will allow them to get more money from search results. More than 270 organizations comprising groups representing news publishers, photographers and music publishers advocated for the rules, and in a joint statement called the bill a \u201chistorical opportunity\u201d to help build \u201can internet that is fair and sustainable for all.\u201d</p><p>Not every publisher is on board. A study prepared for Parliament, which concluded that Article 11 would not help fund the media industry as intended, found that many journalists opposed the proposal.</p><p>Allison Davenport,\u00a0a technology law and policy fellow at the Wikimedia Foundation, said that for platforms like Wikipedia, the link tax will affect contributors\u2019 abilities to find information for Wikipedia and will ultimately shrink \u201cthe depth, accuracy and quality of Wikipedia\u2019s content.\u201d The Asturian, Catalan, Galician and Italian versions of Wikipedia blacked out the sites today in protest of the directive.</p><p>Similar link taxes have been shown to have negative effects on publishers elsewhere; in Spain, for instance, a similar legislation requiring Google pay all publishers for snippets included in its news aggregation service that Google News pulled out of the country entirely, leading to a dramatic decline in traffic to Spanish newspapers.</p><p>After a similar bill passed in Germany, Google simply refused to pay publishers to include their content and waited for publishers to waive the legally-imposed fees. The German publisher Axel Springer tried to hold its own against Google, but after suffering a 40-percent drop in traffic, caved, and let Google include snippets of its news content without paying.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear what exactly the rules might mean for U.S. publishers, who last year told Adweek they were uncertain about whether the rules could hurt or help U.S. publishers not beholden to the same rules.</p><p>Big tech platforms have come out against the bill. In a company blog post published in early March, Google svp of global affairs Kent Walker said the directive \u201ccreates vague, untested requirements, which are likely to result in online services over-blocking content to limit legal risk.\u201d Google has also expressed opposition to Article 11, which would require web platforms pay publishers for aggregating portions of their content, including photos and snippets of articles. In a statement today, a spokesperson for Google said the law will be bad for businesses.</p><p>\u201cThe Copyright Directive is improved but will still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe\u2019s creative and digital economies,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe details matter, and we look forward to working with policy makers, publishers, creators and rights holders as EU member states move to implement these new rules.\u201d</p><p>Facebook, which has previously voiced opposition to parts of the directive, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Smaller platforms that might not be able to shoulder the cost of creating a content-filter or afford the legal risks of hosting content could face even tougher barriers to entry as a result of the bill, MacDonald said in an interview with Adweek prior to the directive\u2019s final approval. She said she feared that the rules will further entrench the power of the big internet platforms because those companies will have the resources to manage it.</p><p>\u201cIf you are not YouTube or Facebook, which has its own tailored tech, and if you are not one of these platforms with massive resources, you might just not take the risk,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cWe are concerned that we will see much fewer open platforms because of this.\u201d</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, along with other digital rights groups and free speech advocates, have warned that platforms\u2019 content-filtering processes could chill free speech and creativity online, especially when those processes often happen automatically and without human review.</p><p>\u201cMachines are good at many things\u2014making the final determination on your rights isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d EFF activism director Elliot Harmon wrote in a February blog post about why the group opposes upload filters that the copyright directive would ultimately require.</p><p>It\u2019s likely that the final text of the bill will be approved by legislators later this month. Barring even more pressure on legislators and a reversal of an EU country\u2019s stance on the bill, the directive will get a final rubber-stamp, and countries in the EU will have until 2021 to implement laws of their own that match the directive. What that will mean in practice, though, is unclear\u2014primarily because the text of the directive leaves lots of room for legal interpretation.</p><p>\u201cI think the legal uncertainty that will be created is really overwhelming for even large companies,\u201d MacDonald said.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the internet in the EU that stands to change dramatically once the bill is implemented. If the industry learned anything from the passage of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, it\u2019s that what happens in the EU doesn\u2019t stay in the EU. Free speech advocates, small publishers and platforms say they will continue to ring the alarm bell hoping to stop other legislative bodies from adopting similar rules.</p><p>\u201cThe EU has squandered the opportunity of a generation,\u201d MacDonald said, \u201c\u2026 and the biggest loser out of this whole reform will be individual users.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1033616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-95M1-DYRK-H2RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Some people called it tech's \"Big Tobacco moment\" while others compared it with past antitrust investigations of Microsoft and AT&amp;T. To me, the hearing - and the ongoing investigations - conjured another set of hearings from 70 years ago: the probe into mob activity led by Sen. Estes Kefauver (D-Tenn.).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those hearings led to a wave of enforcement, new laws and eventually, in 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. What we learned at Wednesday's hearing suggests the behavior of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon calls for a comparably comprehensive and forceful response. (Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are more than a few similarities between the organized crime and these four companies. Like the Mafia, the threats that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google pose to American democracy flow from the power they have over key services (from email to social media to music and film), the way they use dominance in one area to achieve dominance in others and their ability to use fear to stop challenges to their control.</p><p>Like the Mafia, they are a resilient, surveillance-based shadow government. So citizens are dual subjects - of the country, and of the flawed online markets created by these companies. Like the mob, big tech has friends in very high places. Likewise, big tech is an oligarchy with several bosses, who compete in some territories but generally divide power among themselves, without consulting elected officials.</p><p>Obviously, I am not saying Facebook and Google murder and kneecap their opponents, or burn down businesses that refuse to play by their rules; I am not equating tech companies with the mob. While just about every Mafia enterprise was illegal, big tech operates in a legal gray area; these companies argue that they have broken no laws. They evade taxes using legal loopholes, not as the mob does by simply refusing to report income. Still, the analogy is useful, because it helps us think about a certain kind of oligarchic governing power that exists alongside - is interwoven with - responsive democratic systems. It helps us to think through what an effective governmental response to systemic interference with, dominance of, and bullying of businesses with less power might look like.</p><p>The hearing, compressed into one afternoon with all the CEOs present at one time, was not ideal, but arguably the best Congress could get without getting dragged into an extended legal fight over subpoenas. In one of the funnier moments, Bezos said, \"I don't want to be sitting here,\" and then trailed off, revealing a basic truth.</p><p>It went far worse for the titans than you might have expected, given that oversight hearings often feature a series of sleepy (or pointlessly grandstanding) speeches and that big tech has at its disposal potent lobbyists and consultants from every recent presidential administration.</p><p>Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), who heads the subcommittee, kicked off the hearing with an explosive opening statement, arguing that the heads of the tech companies are acting like emperors, and they use three basic strategies - copy, kill and acquire - to make it impossible for upstarts to get a foothold. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) described the result as an \"innovation kill zone,\" because nobody is going to want to create a new product or service if they know their ideas will either be stolen, suppressed or bought at discount, under threat. A lot of the questions were about territory and fear - how the big four built their territories, how they protect it and how they intimidate small business owners and app developers.</p><p>Cicilline's subcommittee used the time constraints well, pinning down the CEOs by using easy-to-understand examples of abusive strategies and explaining how they undermine freedom, equality and fairness.</p><p>In Amazon's case, the hearing showed how the company directly competes against independent sellers in its online marketplace. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) forced Bezos to admit that while his company has a policy against using the data it collects on sellers and their products to create competing goods, he cannot promise the policy has not been violated. Bezos also admitted that a seller may get preferential treatment in a search result if they use affiliated Amazon services such as \"fulfillment by Amazon,\" Amazon's storage, packing and shipping service. The result? Amazon made $60 billion from seller fees last year, and the average fees Amazon charges sellers has jumped from 19 percent of an average sale to 30 percent in five years.</p><p>While Amazon demands tribute, Google focuses on steering those of us who depend on its search engine to its own products. On average, 40 percent of the space on the first page of Google search results direct people to Google products, according to an analysis by the Markup, an investigative nonprofit group focused on tech. Rivals charge that the company scrapes content from other sites and uses it for its own purposes - content such as pictures from Yelp restaurant reviews. Cicilline said the committee had evidence that when Yelp complained about this behavior to Google, Google threatened that Yelp would not show up in search results.</p><p>Cook, of Apple, was sharply questioned about the 30 percent cut Apple takes when consumers pay for an app by an independent company, and why rival screen time apps disappeared from the store at the very moment Apple was promoting a similar product. Cook's repeated response that protecting the \"privacy and security\" of consumers was the reason for expelling such apps - not protecting Apple's financial interests - reminded me of the catchall \"national security\" defense that government officials often give when asked about questionable activities.</p><p>The committee presented documents it had uncovered showing that two months before buying Instagram, Zuckerberg wrote that the \"nascent\" business \"could be very disruptive to us.\" On the day Facebook bought Instagram, he told an engineer he was correct that \"Instagram was our threat,\" adding: \"one thing about start-ups though is you can often acquire them.\"</p><p>These are not small revelations. It is a violation of the Sherman Act to protect a monopoly by buying out or shutting out a direct competitor. It is telling that a congressional committee, not an antitrust enforcement agency like the Federal Trade Commission, revealed these exchanges. The federal enforcers seem not to have been looking - although state antitrust enforcers, who are already in the middle of their own big tech probes, will likely use the new evidence in those investigations.</p><p>But the subcommittee's goal involved more than merely revealing specific instances in which laws might have been broken. This is where the echo of the Mafia hearings is strongest: Like Kefauver, Cicilline wants to reveal and then root out a creeping form of oligarchic power.</p><p>The Kefauver hearings educated the country about the potency and reach of organized crime and led to short- and long-term legal change. That committee's final report recommended a \"racket squad\" within the Justice Department, a federal crime commission, bans on some forms of betting and the creation of what became known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (when it was finally passed in 1970). RICO created major new penalties and civil cause of action for crimes that occurred as part of an ongoing criminal enterprise.</p><p>What the country understood after the Kefauver hearings was that when a large, networked institution engages in systemic bullying it is far more dangerous than occasional or individual wrongs; shadow governments cannot be squashed with piecemeal whack-a-mole enforcement.</p><p>If the analogy to Kefauver's mob hearings holds, Wednesday's hearings could spell the beginning of the end of abusive big tech power. Congress will rouse itself to use its subpoena power to unearth even more damning documents, and the public will realize that four self-important men should not govern us.</p><p>The equivalent of a RICO Act for big tech would be robust new antitrust laws and regulations, such as the structural breakups proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). All of these companies simultaneously own marketplaces and compete in those marketplaces, and they use their clout to maintain their clout. An effective solution would aim directly at their power, not just their practices - just as Kefauver did with the Mafia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-344477dbd5bf4247b70071fecb2f5c3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-SHW1-JB4M-V0P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1437\"/><timeReceived>3:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

To many, this is the evolution of the trade-off for free online content, but the concept still spooks members of the general public. </p><p>The central premise of laws such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act is that businesses are more transparent with consumers over data sharing. But laws in the U.S., including CCPA, are widely considered to be less stringent.\u00a0</p><p>GDPR requires companies that collect personally identifying information on EU citizens to provide them with protections such as gaining their consent to use their data, especially to share it with third parties. CCPA asks that companies give users the ability to opt out by providing a clear \u201cdo not sell my personal information\u201d button, but California residents are essentially opted in by default. </p><p>Many believe GDPR requirements have unfairly burdened publishers whose monetization partners, such as SSPs and measurement providers, rely on them as their interface with the public for gaining consent. Even after GDPR enforcement started in 2018, \u201csequential liability\u201d was a hot-button issue among players in the ecosystem. Partners often tried to offload, or at least limit, their legal culpability for any data leakage along the supply chain. </p><p>Further complicating matters, Google was a notable holdout in the first iteration of the IAB\u2019s Transparency Consent Framework. Sources told Adweek at the time that Google\u2019s reticence to sign on to the data-sharing accord was due to questions about whether it was fit for purpose.But the online behemoth has signed on to the second version of the TCF, which now boasts close to 600 advocates.</p><p>\u201cThis new framework standardizes the process of gathering, managing and communicating user permissions for how their information may be used in the advertising supply chain,\u201d wrote Chetna Bindra, senior product manager of user trust and privacy at Google, in a blog post. \u201cOur integration with the TCF v2.0 applies to ads we serve on publisher inventory and not Google-owned and operated inventory, for which consent is obtained through our own consent flows.\u201d</p><p>Some have attributed Google\u2019s U-turn to increased levels of regulatory scrutiny, both in the EU and at home, and the result of the stark realities of the market. </p><p>Wayne Blodwell, CEO of The Programmatic Advisory, told Adweek that he thinks the online behemoth, whose ad stack contains both buy- and sell-side operations, wanted to designate itself as a \u201cdata controller\u201d instead of a \u201cdata processor,\u201d a scenario that would have ensured it has more control over potential liabilities. </p><p>\u201cThey realized over time that they can\u2019t do that and that they have to get the publisher to get consent for them,\u201d Blodwell said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why they thought they may as well get involved with TCF 2.0.\u201d </p><p>Gary Kibel, a partner specializing in digital media at U.S. law firm Davis &amp; Gilbert, said it\u2019s not unusual for tech giants to perform their own due diligence before deferring to industry standards. </p><p>Legal experts also told Adweek to expect similar debate as occurred in the EU over data sharing and sequential liability in the U.S. market ahead of upcoming legislation, starting with a pending overhaul to CCPA. </p><p>California residents will vote on the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in November. Sources told Adweek the proposed legislation would mean privacy laws in California would more closely adhere to GDPR. They also pointed to a recent open letter from high-profile elected officials asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potential data vulnerabilities in online ad auctions as an example of the heightened awareness among members of the public. </p><p>\u201cWhat I found really interesting about that letter is that it really got into the weeds,\u201d Kibel said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the standard \u2018we don\u2019t like the creepy ad industry\u2019 stuff. It was talking about the data [that can leak] from a losing bid in RTB [real-time bidding] transactions.\u201d</p><p>Jessica Lee, co-chair, privacy, security and data innovation at law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb, said matters are likely to come to a head over the next two years with Google poised to sunset third-party cookies in its market-leading Chrome browser by 2022. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also the same timeline as CPRA, and I anticipate over that period, we\u2019ll start to see what the new version of RTB and rules of the road look like,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lee also explained that privacy promises from Google and Apple (with its pending iOS 14 update) are going to raise \u201cinteroperability challenges\u201d that groups representing each tier of the industry will have to address by 2022. </p><p>\u201cIf you look at things like [the IAB\u2019s] Project Rearc and PRAM [Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media] \u2026 you have different frameworks being proposed with different technical limitations. And then, each platform requires something different, and it just gets harder and harder to operationalize, and then you obviously have to accommodate the biggest players,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMy hope is that we can get everybody around the table and try to achieve some kind of uniformity or interoperability. It won\u2019t be easy, but everyone can come out better on the other side.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1190681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MX-BF11-JC8H-T182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They are an increasingly important channel to help raise capital. </p><p>The ASX, which regulates company disclosure and polices keeping the market properly informed, is increasingly focused on the sector.</p><p>\"We have had cause to take action on fronts that are more unusual than traditional over the last six to 12 months, such as sponsored content and use of social media, even though they have long been areas we've monitored,\" ASX spokesman Matthew Gibbs said, noting advertorials in newspapers including The Australian Financial Review were a popular platform earlier in the year. </p><p>\"ASX is very alert to promoters using various social and other media platforms to 'promote' or 'pump up' stocks to which they're connected. And we're also alive to the issue of 'independent' research funded by companies themselves.\"</p><p>A spokesman for The Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which is focused on real-time market surveillance for investigating alleged market manipulation, said they were alert to the rising trend. </p><p>Within the industry there is also concern, as well as recognition, that there are few other effective ways to get the word out about micro-cap stocks, some of which have been outstanding performers.</p><p>In June of this year, Stocks Digital, one of the earliest and largest online stock promotion websites, wrote to now prime minister Scott Morrison to outline their concerns.</p><p>\"Businesses such as ours who are disadvantaged in the marketplace by the same unauthorised and unlicensed persons. These persons continue to offer and promise 'Riches' to investors with seeming impunity,\" wrote StocksDigital in the letter. </p><p>The letter called out five competitors it felt the regulator should be paying more attention to, although in a copy of the letter seen by AFR Weekend the names were redacted. </p><p>StocksDigital asked Morrison \"to direct the attention of ASIC and its investigators at these organisations and ensure Australian investors ... are protected from those who publicly and defiantly fail to comply with the law and manipulate the market with snake oil promotions\".</p><p>As one of the earlier movers in this market, it's a bold step for StocksDigital - which has many of its own critics in an increasingly snipey, but booming area where news is blurred with promotion. </p><p>New breed of stock promoters</p><p>Just months ago, StocksDigital was weighing up the merits of its own sharemarket listing, telling potential investors it was generating profits of about $2 million a year. </p><p>As micro-cap companies rush to market, the cottage industry that had been restricted to those with a moderate social media following has institutionalised and professionalised.</p><p>But for many, it's still a relatively opaque world that is forging a different set of rules.</p><p>Businesses have been built to cash in on the paid promotion of small companies, many of which are seeking ways to market directly to retail investors who can be critical in getting an IPO over the line, due to the \"spread\" rule which requires 300 or more investors to invest a minimum of $2000.</p><p>\"Their simple premise is 'the days of going to brokers is gone so why don't you come to us. We know where the investors are and we can help you find them',\" says a corporate adviser.</p><p>\"But they are not [all] licensed, not regulated under the Corporations Act and are just promoting stocks willy-nilly.\"</p><p>StocksDigital said regulators were \"having a bit of trouble keeping up\" with the new breed of stock promoters. </p><p>\"The new wave of unlicensed stock promotion via social media, blogs and news websites is the wild west and difficult to police,\" it said, adding StocksDigital operates under an Australian Financial Services Licence with accompanying regulation. </p><p>\"Helping investors make informed decisions is about cross-checking facts, intelligent interpretation, and full disclosure ??? These days anyone can spin up a $30 website and try to charge thousands of dollars to promote a stock with little accountability to either investors or the companies.\"</p><p>Blurred lines</p><p>It can be hard to tell what is paid for and what isn't. Mainstream media publications, including The Australian Financial Review, regularly run paid-for advertorials which are used by companies to promote their businesses.</p><p>Sometimes, they too can overstep.</p><p>In presentations to market participants, the ASX has highlighted issues with disclosure of customer contracts, including announcing contracts without any details, disclosing revenue projections that do not have a proper basis. More relevant to social media promoters or newsletter writers is the use of commissioned research reports to publish \"objectional material\", including forward estimates that haven't been released to the market.</p><p>It's an industry that has helped propel a hashtag: #DYOR - do your own research - to a whole new level.</p><p>StocksDigital, which lists Big Un, Creso Pharma, Lithium Australia, Orinoco, MMJ Phyotech and Milestone Sports as clients on its website, charges $19,500 for a typical three-month \"engagement\", according to one quote, and the client would be expect to reach 11,000 \"targeted and engaged investors\".</p><p>Sometimes this can be paid for in company scrip, sometimes cash. StocksDigital breaks down the three-month fee into $5000 for the initial engagement and $3500 for each month after that. And they say the \"large, in-depth article\" guarantees 5000 readers with a minimum view time of 4.37 seconds. Additional investor articles are $7500 for one or $20,000 for four.</p><p>There's also booster packages - for an additional fee.</p><p>Another service which blurs the lines between promotion and news is Bulls N Bears, a joint venture involving Business News. It says its point of difference is that it \"guarantees coverage in The West Australian\", including a daily breaking news email bulletin loaded on to The West Australian's website, posted to the The West Australian's Twitter account and The West Australian Facebook account. The cost? $1575 a month. The same monthly fee also covers managing the company's Twitter account. </p><p>\"Our stories go out under the banner of existing mainstream news media outlets which adds considerable news credibility to them\" is part of the pitch, according to an email. </p><p>When contacted by the AFR Weekend, Bulls N Bears said: \"Our clients do not pay us for the news content of the articles but rather they pay us to ensure their ASX news is actually covered - how we cover it [is] how we see it.\" It said the company would not take stock or options for its services.<br/><br/> \"For whatever reason the mainstream media has gravitated towards large-cap stories over the last decade ... there is still a very strong market interest in the activities of small-cap companies that are doing interesting things.</p><p>\"Bulls N Bears exists to ensure that the news relating to the next big tech play or the next massive biotech breakthrough or the next big lithium find is covered along the way before it becomes obvious to the wider news audience.</p><p>\"We can smell a beat-up a mile away too and, whilst it doesn't happen all that often, we won't hesitate to walk away from those companies who are just relentlessly trying to whip the donkey that won't move because it has no ability.\"</p><p>Also in the mix is Stockhead, which has told potential clients it is targeting coverage of two positive articles for every 1.5 negative articles across the site, which the company denied. </p><p>\"There is not - and has never been - a ratio or any policy regarding 'positive' to 'negative' stories on Stockhead. Editorial decision-making is based solely on newsworthiness,\" Stockhead said. The company does not accept scrip as payment.</p><p>The cost of working with the platform is variable; the offering starts at $4000 a month.</p><p>Stockhead is owned by AG Media Investments, which has some common shareholders with investor relations firm Media &amp; Capital Partners. Like more mainstream publications, the pitch to clients is that the sponsored content is labelled \"special report\" and interspersed with news stories. The claim is 75 per cent of the website's content is independent. (The website says 100 per cent of the journalism is independent, presumably excluding sponsored content).</p><p>???And, despite these newer upstarts, stock forum HotCopper is a stayer in the spruiker infrastructure. The influential platform listed on the ASX in 2016. </p><p>The company says in its marketing pitch that it is the largest financial news site with more page views than Google Finance, the ASX, <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.com.au/\">news.com.au</url> and The Australian Financial Review per Nielsen ratings. It says the $12,000 spend for its Corporate Spotlight package - effectively a banner advert on the company's forum home page - will increase its audience by 3.5 times.</p><p>Hot Copper charges $12,500 a time for an email blast to its large base of registered users. A few years ago that was closer to $20,000. The company says that reduction is due to increased competition, as well as a move away from the so-called \"sugar hit\" or one-off promotion to more sustained campaigns that roll out over a year. The site gets about 10,000 posts a day, with about 150 reported for moderating and 40 per cent of that number cleared. </p><p>HotCopper said that, while the company doesn't take shares or options for services, it sometimes will take a \"matching stake\" in an equity raise. In other words, it will invest the cash it has been paid for services in the company. The company said the shares were voluntarily escrowed for six months, and the portfolio managed by Perth broker Euroz. The board therefore doesn't make portfolio decisions, removing potential conflicts of interest. </p><p>But last year regulators demanded that the company disclose that these were paid advertisements from the company and that HotCopper did \"not endorse, approve or have responsibility\" for the offers and statements.</p><p>\"We see our biggest competitor as Twitter,\" HotCopper said. ???</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029834696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9P-WRS1-JBJ7-N1X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1768\"/><timeReceived>08:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Fifteen years ago, just before the global financial crisis, the bank easily outshone its Wall Street rivals\u2014winning the most lucrative deals and making the most profitable trades. It printed money, both for shareholders and employees. Although the crisis imperilled the firm along with the rest of the banking industry, it navigated the chaos relatively well. Success allowed it to be haughty\u2014while other banks engaged in the grubby game of sucking up to investors, Goldman remained secretive and enigmatic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How times have changed. This week the firm held its first investor day, led by David Solomon, who took over as chief executive last year. It comes after a long period of underperformance. A dollar invested in Goldman in 2010 would be worth just $1.60 today. A dollar wagered on the S&amp;P 500 would be worth $3.60, and on JPMorgan Chase, $4.10. Goldman has become a laggard.</p><p>Its predicament reflects two big changes in Western banking. One is the declining profitability of capital-markets activity, in large part the result of tighter rules, including higher capital requirements for riskier activity, penalties on lenders that rely on debt markets to fund themselves and tighter compliance regimes. The second is the rising importance of technology in the industry, as consumers and corporate borrowers shift to digital banking. This appears to give an immediate advantage to very large lenders that can support huge IT budgets, and to big tech platform firms that have vast numbers of customers who can be sold financial products, as is already the case in much of Asia.</p><p>Goldman has been on the wrong side of these trends. Consider its performance relative to JPMorgan Chase, a giant full-service firm. Goldman is still wrestling with past compliance mistakes\u2014it is expected to pay billions of dollars in penalties for the 1MDB scandal in Malaysia. Its funding costs are higher than JPMorgan Chase's (1.95% compared with 1.25% in 2018). Its ratio of expenses to revenues is worse. Not surprisingly, its return on tangible equity, a measure of profitability, was just 11% in 2019, compared with 19% for its rival. For Goldman's shareholders the only consolation is that it has done better than Europe's flailing banks\u2014in the most recently reported quarter Barclays managed 10%, Credit Suisse 9%, and Deutsche Bank made a loss.</p><p>Mr Solomon's new plan is, in part, to become more like JPMorgan Chase, with a broader range of services and funding. Goldman wants to expand Marcus, its fast-growing consumer arm, and also to build out its transaction-banking division that ships money around the world for companies. It plans to attract more deposits, which are typically the cheapest way to fund a bank. It has hired an army of tech experts. All this, Goldman hopes, will raise its return on tangible equity to 14%. </p><p>Goldman says it recognises the need for fundamental reform. It boasts of transforming its macho culture with a more diverse intake of recruits. But you can question how much it has really changed. It continues to allocate half its capital to its once-famed trading operation, despite its drab returns. And it still spends a lavish $12bn a year on rewarding its staff, even as the firm earned only $8bn for its shareholders in 2019. So far investors remain sceptical, with its shares priced at their book value. </p><p>If Goldman's reinvention fails it may ultimately have to do a deal. Uniting Wells Fargo and Goldman, for example, would create something more like JPMorgan Chase (and with a similar-sized balance-sheet). In America regulators and some politicians are sceptical about bigger banks. In Europe, where the industry is more desperate, the mood has already changed, with matchmaking now encouraged. At least Goldman's mergers-and-acquisitions advisers will be in on any action. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-FK8D54Q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y45-R4G1-DY2R-201H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

I can never forget that, no matter what my personal feelings might be.\"</p><p>Thirteen years later and that conflict has come to a head.</p><p>On Friday, current commissioner Adam Silver revealed that Beijing had asked him to fire Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, after Mr Morey sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong.\u00a0</p><p>The latest revelation followed a week of outrage on both sides of the Pacific, with NBA supporters in America appealing to the league not to bow to Chinese pressure.\u00a0</p><p>In the end Mr Silver's response was blunt - \"We said there's no chance that's happening. There's no chance we'll even discipline him.\"</p><p>But the episode has created an awakening in the West about the extent of Chinese influence over American corporations, which has metastised through Hollywood, the gaming, hotel and airline industries, big tech, automobile makers, and others.\u00a0</p><p>Corporate America is facing accusations that is sacrificing free speech in order to make\u00a0a buck in the East.</p><p>\"The NBA episode just emphasised the clash between the effort to stick up for Western values and the desire of companies, not just corporate America but multinationals, to serve their bottom line,\" said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>\"This really impacted Americans in a way that other incidents hadn't because of America's love of sport. But this is not a new problem. The Chinese are trying to ride this, to use it to stoke nationalism, and spread support for the Chinese communist party. This is a playbook they've been using for several years, it works, and they're going to use it more.\"</p><p>With the exception of the odd executive American companies have shown little desire to uphold the ideals of the West in the face of Chinese pressure.</p><p>And, when they do, they have not been treated sympathetically by their own employers. The dollar, or in this case the yuan, rules.</p><p>For many US industries the Chinese market, with its 1.4 billion customers, is the Holy Grail.</p><p>Over the next 20 years China will need more than 6,000 new airplanes, a market worth around $1 trillion. In 2020, China's film market will for the first time eclipse North America as the biggest in the world, raking in over $12 billion at the box office.</p><p>In recent years Apple has sold up to a quarter of its iPhones in China. Starbucks has over 3,000 stores there, its biggest market outside the US. Nike made $1.38 billion in China last year, 70 per cent of it from shoes.</p><p>In exchange, China has expected an acquiescence from these corporations on politically sensitive topics, particularly those surrounding its geographic sovereignty.\u00a0</p><p>Last year, Marriott International, which has over 100 hotels in China, had its website shut down for a week after the Cyberspace Administration internet watchdog found it had listed Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong as separate countries from China.</p><p>Marriott's apology was unequivocal. It said: \"Marriott International respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. We don't support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. \"We sincerely apologise for any actions that may have suggested otherwise.\"</p><p>Beijing also threatened to sanction US airlines - American, Delta, and United - unless they made changes to how they classified Taiwan on their websites. They all did.\u00a0</p><p>A wave of luxury brands recently released statements apologising for a variety of perceived slights against China, among them\u00a0Givenchy, Calvin Klein, Versace and Swarovski.\u00a0</p><p>Hollywood studios hold a special place among those prepared to go the extra mile not to offend China.</p><p>In 2016, Marvel Studios cast Tilda Swinton to play a character in \"Doctor Strange\" who was originally supposed to be from Tibet. C. Robert Cargill, the screenwriter, said to make the character Tibetan would \"risk alienating one billion people who think that that's bulls--t, and risk the Chinese government going, 'We're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'\"</p><p>The method of control works both ways.\u00a0When Top Gun: Maverick came along, US fans quickly spotted that Tom Cruise's jacket was without the Taiwanese flag it had borne in the original film 30 years earlier. The sequel was partly produced by the Chinese production company Tencent Pictures, which also funded \"Wonder Woman\".</p><p>The pressure has become more aggressive in recent years, as China has opened up to the Internet, making it more difficult for corporations to tailor their messages to a geographic audience.\u00a0</p><p>\"China used to only worry about speech and behaviour that occurred in China, and in Chinese,\" said Scott Kennedy, a Washington-based authority on the Chinese economy. \"Now, it's speech and behaviour that occurs anywhere, even in English, even on platforms Chinese people can't have access to legally. The Chinese expansion of its propaganda and censorship system is the biggest change.\"</p><p>That includes an army of concerned Chinese citizens scouring the internet for offensive acts by foreign companies.\u00a0</p><p>It was a Tweet - just seven words long - that landed the NBA in China's bad books.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" Mr Morley wrote on Twitter on Oct 4, in reference to the months of anti-Beijing protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous city.\u00a0</p><p>In an instant, the NBA's lucrative relationship with China - \u00a0it accounts for about 10 per cent of net revenue and growing - imploded. China cancelled TV coverage of NBA games. Chinese advertisers, taking their cue from the government, ran for the hills.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Morley's tweet was subsequently deleted, and a statement on Weibo, China's alternative to Twitter, said the NBA was \"extremely disappointed\" by the \"inappropriate\" comment.\u00a0</p><p>But there were hints that the league's\u00a0response would diverge from the standard grovelling retraction. A statement in English merely said the situation was \"regrettable\".\u00a0</p><p>The NBA later said it would not \"regulate what players, employees and team owners say.\"\u00a0</p><p>On Friday, Mr Silver said losses from the fallout had been \"fairly dramatic\", and were continuing, but he stuck by the NBA's position.\u00a0</p><p>The NBA's stance has won support among its fans in the US, and even brought the Hong Kong protest movement into mainstream consciousness.\u00a0Some started taking \"Free Hong Kong\" signs to games.</p><p>Last week Marco Rubio, the Republican senator, accused China of \"using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally\".</p><p>He was speaking after gaming company Activision Blizzard, in which Tencent has a stake, suspended an e-sports player who shouted \"Liberate Hong Kong\" in Mandarin during a live broadcast. His $10,000 prize money was withdrawn.</p><p>Mark Kern, a prominent former Blizzard employee, led vocal opposition to the move and urged other gamers to \"rise up\" to protect free speech, despite the risks to his own business investments.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Kern, who is ethnically Chinese, wrote on Twitter: \"We are in a situation where unlimited Communist money dictates our American values. We censor our games for China, we censor our movies for China. Now, game companies are silencing voices for freedom and democracy.</p><p>\"I take a huge risk by saying this. China monitors all social media and I know this means that we will probably never get an investment from China for my new MMO [multiplayer online game], and probably never get a licence to operate there.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-57130977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9R-5PM1-F021-60X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1327\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 20, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Google case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through Oracle v. Google, Google casts itself as a benevolent, pro-competition and pro-innovation tech giant who wants to see small tech companies and startups flourish in a healthy free market -- which pushes back on the idea that Google deserves the antitrust treatment.</p><p>But Washington's recent animosity towards Silicon Valley may negate Google's efforts to save face.</p><p>Google worked out an agreement with Sun Microsystems in 2005 to use Microsystems' Java SE application program interface (API) platform for Android. Google didn't end up using Sun Microsystems' Java SE platform and instead developed its own API platform, but used Java programming language and terminology.</p><p>(APIs are essentially computer languages allowing two different software programs to communicate. On the internet, APIs can allow an individual to use a preexisting account -- like a Facebook or Google account -- to log into a separate website, like a retail site.)</p><p>Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and promptly sued for copyright infringement, claiming Google stole its application program interfaces (APIs) for Google's Java platform on Android.</p><p>Google successfully monetized Android, raking in $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit, according to an Oracle lawyer. Now, Oracle wants $9 billion of that pie, because Oracle says Google's use of Java destroyed Oracle's ability to license Java and forced Oracle to give Amazon a 97.5 percent discount to use Oracle's Java instead of Google's. Oracle even has internal emails between Google employees showing how they knew no other API platform was as good as Java, and intentionally ripped off Java for Android.</p><p>Essentially, Oracle claims Google cheated.</p><p>Google contends the APIs are fair use and not copyrightable, because the software industry routinely uses, reuses and modifies existing APIs to create new products and services. To copyright APIs could chill innovation and hamstring startup tech companies looking to use preexisting APIs in new ways -- which is what Silicon Valley has done for years. It's also what Google has done for years and built its business on.</p><p>(Some tech experts would describe this as edge providers making money off of content creators and software developers without fairly compensating those creators and developers.)</p><p>But the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in Oracle's favor, and Google appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), who just asked the Trump administration yesterday for its views on the case.</p><p>While no company -- Google included -- wants to give up even a small piece of a profitable business, a skim of Google's court documents and the amicus briefs filed by tech think tanks like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Public Knowledge make Google's stance very clear. If Oracle wins, innovation, small business and the tech community will suffer. Google considers itself on the side of the 'little guy' and the future of tech innovation.</p><p>For example, Google calls the appellate court's ruling a \"devastating one-two punch at the computer software industry\" in its request for a deadline extension to file a petition to SCOTUS last fall.</p><p>In its 2014 SCOTUS petition (which SCOTUS denied), Google said, \"The developer community has long understood that interfaces are free for everyone to use. That understanding has enabled all of the innovation described above, and much more. The Federal Circuit's decision turns this understanding on its head, balkanizing computer languages and interfaces, requiring programmers to build from the ground up, precluding interoperability, and depriving consumers of the benefits of compatibility. At a bare minimum, that would make innovation much costlier and raise severe barriers to entry.\"</p><p>The tech think tanks -- which historically favor most Silicon Valley positions -- agree.</p><p>\"It is unusual for a decision of copyright law to implicate nearly every key modern technology, to upset settled expectations of industry, and potentially even to frustrate the ability of the federal government to do its job,\" Public Knowledge and D.C.-based think tank the R Street Institute said in a joint amicus brief supporting Google in February. \"Yet that is the situation of the present case.\"</p><p>In a March 2018 blog post, EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry wrote, \"The Federal Circuit has upended decades of software industry practice and created legal uncertainty that will chill innovation.\"</p><p>In a statement to InsideSources on SCOTUS' request for the Trump administration's opinion, Google repeated its pro-innovation message.</p><p>\"The outcome of this case will have a significant impact on the future of American innovation,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"We are asking the Supreme Court to hold that copyright law supports the kind of interoperability that has been critical to the progress of software development in the United States.\"</p><p>But the Trump administration already doesn't view Google favorably, and the lobbying numbers don't add up in Google's favor.</p><p>In 2018 alone, Oracle lobbied the Executive Office of the President almost half a million dollars through lobbying group Navigators Global, while Google hasn't lobbied the EOP at all at least since 2006, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Despite President Donald Trump's fear over Google's search algorithms being biased against conservatives, Google seems to have placated Trump's worry that Google is more committed to the Chinese military instead of the U.S. military.</p><p>Google's push to change the Big Tech narrative may not be too late. The Solicitor General will file a brief expressing the Trump administration's views sometime over the summer -- perhaps as late as August -- so there is still time for Google to sway the administration in its favor. Meanwhile, the tech think tanks continue to advance Google's cause.</p><p>Oracle declined to comment for this story.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

In doing so, they'll also decide who will take on the responsibility of regulating the state's technology industry \u2013 a sector that has become an integral part of New York's economy and increasingly dependent on state policy makers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Underwood, who was appointed as former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's replacement after he stepped down in May, has been an advocate for net neutrality on a national level, but has stayed relatively quiet on tech companies' relationship with New York officials. Schneiderman, on the other hand, had a more complicated relationship with the tech community, taking on sports betting disruptors FanDuel and DraftKings and home-sharing service Airbnb during his tenure.</p><p> Now more than ever, the local tech community likely wants an attorney general who will have a proper understanding of the sector and the issues that affect it. Perhaps more importantly, the industry would want the next attorney general to be unaffected by the preferences of groups with roots in the city, and those groups' relationships with city officials (see: the recent cap on the number of cars licensed by ride-hailing companies like Uber that have disrupted the well-connected New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission).</p><p> So how does each Democratic attorney general candidate fare in both categories? Considering the limited conversation around tech during the campaign, it's hard to say definitively. But their past lives and their responses to a room full of NYC techies during a panel hosted by Axios, Tech:NYC and WeWork back in August provide some details.</p><p> Two of the four candidates have actually worked for a technology company. One of them, Leecia Eve, is a lobbyist for Verizon and on leave from her post as its vice president of government affairs for the tri-state region. She said during the panel that she understands \"the role of technology better by far than (her) opponents,\" alluding to her executive role at a telecommunications company, but her background also puts her in a complicated position. She, like all three of her opponents, presents herself as a strong proponent of net neutrality. \"My company, Verizon, has never engaged and never will engage in paid prioritization,\" she said at the WeWork panel in August. \"No blocking. No throttling.\" But Verizon has been called out for that exact offense \u2013 and against California firefighters who thought they had unlimited data, no less. Democratic senators in Washington have since asked the FCC to investigate, and while Eve isn't directly responsible, it does speak to the complicated nature of her loyalties.</p><p> Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, meanwhile, was the chief operating officer of a New York-based software startup called Kiodex, Inc. from 2000 to 2003. He's able to speak fluently about the importance of H1B visas to tech companies and of innovation to New York City, spoke most vehemently against the Uber cap during the panel, and told eager attendees more than once that the attorney general should be their partner. He displayed a strong understanding of the issues associated with trying to marry emerging tech with an established (sometimes antiquated) governing system.</p><p> \"I've spent 10 years practicing law in this city ... but it doesn't mean you can't stand on your own two feet and answer a simple question like whether you support the cap or not,\" Maloney said. \"Because what's really going on with that question is whether you support the old school political bosses and political interests in this city or whether you support innovation and you are willing to deal with the disruptions and manage them as you go, because if you put an artificial cap on it, you are going to retard the creative atmosphere that all of you are working so hard to create it. And I'm opposed to it.\"</p><p> On the other hand, it would be risky to assume that the congressman would prioritize these issues should he win, completely unaffected by the needs or wants of outside groups. \"Maloney my guess is probably personally the most pro-tech of that group, so that's good,\" political strategist and venture capitalist Bradley Tusk told City &amp; State. \"But you know, he's also very political.\"</p><p> With the exception of net neutrality, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James has been perhaps the least committal of the candidates on tech issues. She said she thinks Uber raises a lot of social justice issues but \"disagree(s) with the approach of the vote (and) think(s) there should have been more analysis.\"</p><p> On data privacy, she said she believes in government access to open data to address social justice issues in New York, says it's important that business disclose what data they gather, and that personal data not be abused and \"is clearly protected.\"</p><p> If Maloney appeared to be the most informed candidate, James came away looking as the least. And aside from presiding over the New York City Council during votes like the one on the Uber cap, her background has little to no connection to the tech industry.</p><p> Zephyr Teachout was the only one of the four candidates has explicitly come out in support of the Uber cap bill. \"I support the Uber cap bill,\" she said on Twitter. \"We need to reduce congestion, break up concentrated power, and support drivers. Too many drivers have been squeezed out by big tech companies that steal all the money - and the dignity - from drivers.\"</p><p> She avoided weighing in on the Uber cap during the WeWork panel, although she was asked many times to take a side. Instead, she repeated the need for an AG to prioritize, outlining her own priorities as being voting, corruption, campaign finance reform and mass incarceration \u2013 basically, nothing tech-related.

How do you understand or manage something that has never happened before? In finance, the pandemic has demonstrated the value of, and the need for, human judgment in an increasingly algorithm-driven sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, the pandemic shock could, and should, lead to important changes in how we handle risk in finance.</p><h>Texte/Text</h><p>Canadian finance has a very specific risk profile. The evolution of Canadian finance resulted in a corporate and regulatory architecture that was highly effective at dealing with systemic risks, especially against mortgage and investment exposure. Canadian banks favoured stability, conservatism and large reserves.</p><p>In the 20th century, national institutions such as the Bank of Canada and supranational agreements, such as Basel Accords on liquidity and capital requirements, were put into place to coordinate risk within and beyond national borders.</p><p>Up until the early 20th century, bankers relied on personal and professional networks to assess the three Cs of banking credit - character, capacity and capital of the borrower. In the postwar decades, risk management became more systematic and eventually model-driven.</p><p>But the real transformations came with the advent of Big Tech and especially Big Data. Cloud computing, major advancements in processing power and speed and falling costs all drove technology adoption in the past decade.</p><p>The industry became increasingly dependent on both machine-assisted and, in many cases, fully automated risk adjudication as financial institutions expanded their reach.</p><p>That's what risk-management systems roughly looked like on the eve of the pandemic of 2020.</p><p>But the systems are only half the story. The other half is all about the way we think about risk.</p><p>In the broader context, scholars of risk point to two major waves that changed the way we think about risk in the North Atlantic world. The Chernobyl nuclear incident in 1986 caused a complete reassessment of the need to manage risk associated with human-made environmental disasters. The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 was another watershed, as it challenged the deep relationship of trust between individuals and financial systems.</p><p>The pandemic of 2020 has been a big enough and deep enough shock to the global financial system that it could well herald a \"third wave\" of change in the way we think about risk.</p><p>Thus far, the pandemic has outstripped the GFC in its impact. The events of 2020 have also shown that current risk-management tools failed to acknowledge the true range of the possible. In spite of all our prior experience, our expensive technology and our risk models, nobody saw this one coming.</p><p>So how can financial institutions possibly prepare for the next crisis?</p><p>First, human judgment must reclaim a more prominent role.</p><p>Without it, we are courting new and bigger dangers. Big Data is doing remarkable things for risk management, but if the data inputs are too narrow or too broad, conclusions are meaningless.</p><p>Second, applying a long-run lens to risk is vital. Executives understandably focus on the day, the week, the quarter, but a systematic effort to incorporate context is crucial to understanding and managing risk. It's a simple idea that is not so simple to implement.</p><p>Third, a multifaceted assessment of risk in the postpandemic world must address a perceived wider problem in corporate decision-making: incorporating more complex and even contradictory views in the decision engine.</p><p>As Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction, has observed, decision-making systems need to privilege and protect independent judgments, uncontaminated by conformity pressure and buoyed by free critique.</p><p>Hence, diversity of thought, as well as diversity of decision-makers, will be an effective way to drive performance compared with machine output only.</p><p>Fourth, understand where your decision-makers are coming from. Their personal history matters as much as your institutional history.</p><p>A recent paper in The National Bureau of Economic Research found \"that managers who enter the labour market during recessions exhibit a strong proclivity to reduce their firm's systematic risk.\" The research implies that controlling for those biases is important.</p><p>Finally, the pandemic has pointed to the need for a broader and more systematic use of the \"reverse stress test.\" Risk managers need to understand the key risk parameters and reverse engineer scenarios that deliver aggregate losses in excess of the maximum tolerable loss.</p><p>Machines are unequivocally better equipped for this task. Human judgment should then be deployed to determine how probable the scenario is and whether the risk of occurrence is acceptable.</p><p>The other lesson is that the second-best defence against the unknown is the ability to respond quickly. That way, rather than run your business based on the worst case which might only happen once every 10 to 15 years, you can run your business with only a modest nod to the possibility of the unknown because you can react to it quickly when it happens.</p><p>The pandemic of 2020 has appeared in many guises: the destroyer (of lives and livelihoods), or the divider (generating tension, highlighting inequality).</p><p>When it comes to risk and finance, it has come in the guise of the Great Revealer by exposing the system's decision-making overreliance on Big Data.</p><p>It has also underscored the urgency of reinforcing the organizational behaviours that support decision-making in a complex and transformational era.</p><p>In a nutshell, the pandemic points to four key insights: 1) acknowledging strong capital and liquidity as the first and strongest defence; 2) reinforcing financial risk-management systems appropriately with sophisticated human judgment; 3) avoiding the hubris of technological infallibility; and 4) ultimately finding a new equilibrium between harnessing the awesome power of algorithms and artificial intelligence, and the irreplaceable, inimitable power of human judgment.</p><h>Correction</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revision type: Modification</emphasis></p><p>Revision date: Tuesday, September 15, 2020</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GMGAM2202009142rbcomussiorisk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V9-64K1-F06S-3112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Consumers and businesses are wholeheartedly embracing mobile wallets powered by QR codes as the best way to pay, pretty much no matter where they are \u2013 or who they are. In fact, QR tech is so ingrained in China that even panhandlers are no longer asking for spare change, but are asking passersby to scan QR codes to make donations. Beggars can apparently be choosers when mobile payments are thrown into the mix.   But for all their remarkable success in the East, QR codes never really quite caught on in the United States or most of the rest of the West. Often written off as a technological solution in desperate search of an actual problem, the QR code fell by the wayside development-wise.   U.S. consumers could have learned to pay with QR codes, but the technology hit two major roadblocks. The first was that American mobile-wallet providers pretty much avoided it, starting with Apple eschewing QR codes in 2014 in favor of the higher-tech (and more secure) NFC technology.   Second, U.S. consumer interest in adopting mobile payments had been pretty consistently low. It turned out Americans liked paying by card just fine and weren\u2019t looking for a change.   Or at least they weren\u2019t until COVID-19. According to PYMNTS/PayPal\u2019s most recent  How We Shop Report , the pandemic raised concerns about health and safety that resulted in some very notable shifts in consumer preference.   By and large, they\u2019ve shifted away from physical shopping experiences to digital ones \u2013 and it seems that many might be quite content to stay that way for some time. Only about half of those who said in March that they would return to physical retail after COVID-19 were still planning to stick with brick-and-mortar shopping.   The other half was now leaning toward staying digital \u2013 and when they do go to stores, contactless payments have taken on big importance. Some 57 percent of consumers reported that they now pick merchants partly based on the payments options offered.   Contactless payments have become an area of high interest, with 26 percent of consumers saying that merchants must accept contactless to make people feel comfortable shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. Among QR code enthusiasts, the pull is even stronger.   \u201cThe convenience of using digital payments such as QR codes resonates so well that over one-third of the consumers who prefer them [34 percent] would not even consider making purchases in a physical store without them,\u201d the new study found. Moreover, the report found that among digital wallet users, 40 percent reported that they wouldn\u2019t transact with merchants who couldn\u2019t take payments from one.   The study further found that QR codes are emerging as an important offering \u2013 not only for consumers, but also for merchants to enhance their loyalty relationships with customers. That\u2019s particularly true when merchants pair QR with other often-requested features like buy now, pay later (BNPL).   And as consumer interest in contactless payments in general \u2013 and QR code-based payments in specific \u2013 has grown, so has big-name interest in the area.  PayPal unveiled a QR code payment system in May to help hard-hit small merchants accept contactless payments without having to take on any sort of complex hardware integration.   \u201c[PayPal] accelerated the efforts around QR codes \u2026 because our consumers and merchants are demanding and requesting contactless payments,\u201d PayPal Senior Vice President Jeremy Jonker , head of consumer in-store and digital commerce,  told Karen Webster in a conversation over the summer. \u201c[But] a lot of payment methods today aren't necessarily contactless. You still have to do a signature \u2026 you still have to put in PIN codes. What we developed [is] purely and truly contactless.\u201d   He added that as QR codes become more integrated into regular commercial life for consumers, the codes can begin to live up more fully to their potential. Jonker said the beauty of QR codes is that they offer a contactless payment that\u2019s not completely bound to a structured retail environment.   \u201cIt's completely unstructured,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou can take it and transact in any context, in any channel\u201d \u2013 which opens the door to a host of innovative possibilities to create more personal connections to consumers.   And PayPal isn\u2019t the only Big Tech looking to attack the payments game with QR codes. Apple might have once picked NFC over QR, but is now taking a second look as it contemplates building QR tech into its own offering.   Published reports show that some code detected in the iOS 14 operating system that Apple recently unveiled indicates that the tech giant is working on letting users make payments with Apple Pay via QR codes scanned with iPhone cameras. When a user scans the code in-store, that will instruct the Apple Wallet app to perform the transaction with Apple Pay\u2019s servers over its cell network.   And as big names in tech are rushing to enable QR codes, merchants are getting in on the gold rush as well. CVS and Walgreens have both announced big QR integrations this year, as has Crate &amp; Barrel. Meanwhile, the  Jacksonville JaguarsNFL team is allowing QR-based mobile payments  at retailers and concessions at the franchise\u2019s stadium through a mobile Jags Pay wallet in the official team app.   Uber Eats also announced a new QR-based upgrade this week for in-restaurant dining. It will allow diners to scan QR codes to order and pay for their meals, all within the safety of the Uber app.   That\u2019s well-timed: As PYMNTS studies have demonstrated throughout the pandemic, consumers want to feel safe \u2013 safe when they shop and safe when they pay. And if they aren\u2019t feeling safe with something, they aren\u2019t going to do it.   For now, QR codes are a payment method that\u2019s delivering that sense of safety. That means a method that was once a payments fizzle in the U.S. market is now well on its way to becoming a payments sizzle in a post-pandemic world.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

The pandemic has shredded the putrid facade and revealed the rot, much to the dismay of the multitude of minions tasked with sanitizing the rot behind narratives promoting the normalization of predation, fraud and exploitation.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZbS02MaATgc/XRk16XIyMKI/AAAAAAAAQvc/xfyfaMsz_9kXQaE0xspXkMc_k5hmnHKJwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/park-city-1688712_960_720.jpgWhat's\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZbS02MaATgc/XRk16XIyMKI/AAAAAAAAQvc/xfyfaMsz_9kXQaE0xspXkMc_k5hmnHKJwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/park-city-1688712_960_720.jpgWhat's</url> been absolutely verboten is to call legalized pillage and predation what they really are: evil.We've normalized exploitation and predation by the usual means: denial, legal justifications, making excuses for the predators and the system that defends predation, and by erasing the memory of a time when moral bankruptcy, predation and institutionalized fraud were not yet normalized.People have always been self-absorbed and greedy, so goes the excuse; or, greed is good because that's the magic ofthe invisible handat work.By stripping fraud and predation of moral consequence, we've covered the putrid rot with a thoroughly modern amoralitywhich we can summarize asanything goes and winner takes all.Monopoly, quasi-monopoly and cartels (i.e. Warren Buffett's entire portfolio) are presented as the natural order of things rather than an evil construct of predation and exploitation that benefits the few at the expense of the many.Nothing outrages the apologists and the lackeys enriching themselves in thedens of thievesmore than accusations of evil, or indeed, anything smacking of moral standards or judgments.Anything goesnot just for individual choices, but for capital's choices as well, and so it's simply not PC to question the morality of capital's predations.As forwinner takes all, thislegalized lootingis presented as a form of economic Darwinism that is nothing but the healthy manifestation of a free market.This is the Devil's handiwork, of course, presentinglegalized lootingthat only benefits the few as the inevitable result of open markets.The greater the outrage of the technocrats and monopolists at being called what they are--evil--the greater the confirmation that the accusation is spot-on.The predators, looters and exploiters must strip away any moral assessment of their actions, as even the smallest shred of moral or karmic justice threatens their empires. And so economics has been reduced to bloodless quantifications of profits, costs and sales and obfuscatory mathematics designed to drain the risk of moral consequences from the parasitic pillage.The greatest monopolist of early modern capitalism, John D. Rockefeller, struggled his entire life to reconcile his Christian values with the evils of his monopoly.He never fully succeeded, of course, ultimately using self-serving justifications of the \"good\" he'd done by stabilizing erratic markets and selling predictably priced oil products to the public (at prices fixed by his monopoly).In effect, Rockefeller was praising the model of apublic utility:an entity that is regulated to serve the public with essential products and services at a fair and stable price.This is why I've proposed turning Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Amazon, et al. into public utilities via regulationsthat make it illegal to 1) collect users' data and 2) sell the data. Each quasi-monopoly should be broken into competing pieces that cannot buy other pieces or pieces of other quasi-monopolies, or buy back their own shares.Monopolies and cartels are evil because they are exploitive by their very nature.This is why the political system imposed anti-trust legislation in the early 20th century. And this is why technocrat apologists spew endless sophistries aimed at persuading us that these Big Tech monopolies aren't actually monopolies and therefore anti-trust doesn't apply to them. Their frantic efforts only confirm the truth: Big Tech monopolies are in fact monopolies, and therefore they are evil.Public utilities are ultimately accountable to voters and taxpayers. Predatory private monopolies are only accountable to their predatory, parasitic owners, a truth that their immense armies of technocrat apologists, lackeys and apparatchiks attempt to obscure.Monopolies, quasi-monopolies and cartels are inherently exploitive and thus evil, and so everyone profiting from these evils is also evil.Yes, \"shareholder value\" derived from monopolies, quasi-monopolies and cartels is evil. No denial, no excuses. The karmic consequences-- let's call themmoral dividends--are being readied for delivery. Professing ignorance or sainthood won't stop or even delay the delivery. The Devil is chuckling at your deliciously ironic (now long departed) slogan, \"don't be evil.\"Dear shareholders and monopolists: the banquet of consequences is being served. Don't choke on the cold serving of karma.

Continue reading How the  Plandemic  video hoax went viral</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Illustration by Grayson Blackmon and Alex Castro / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the big social platforms have generally been quicker than usual to intervene in the spread of misinformation. We ve seen Facebook, Google, and Twitter add various labels, warnings, and links to high-quality news sources and public health organizations. And for the most part, the dumbest theories about the novel coronavirus have not reached huge scale   unless the theory was suggested by the president of the United States, in which case, well.</p><p>But some cracks are beginning to show. In February, a set of bizarre and almost incomprehensible theories began to spread on YouTube and Facebook alleging that 5G cellular networks had played a role in spreading the virus. And last week, we saw the emergence of the first true hit conspiracy video of the COVID-19 era. It s called  Plandemic,  and like many conspiracy videos it asserts that a shadowy cabal of elites is using a global crisis as a cover to profiteer and entrench their power. Here s Davey Alba in the New York Times:</p><p>In the 26-minute video, the woman asserted how Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading voice on the coronavirus, had buried her research about how vaccines can damage people s immune systems. It is those weakened immune systems, she declared, that have made people susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19.</p><p>The video, a scene from a longer dubious documentary called  Plandemic,  was quickly seized upon by anti-vaccinators, the conspiracy group QAnon and activists from the Reopen America movement, generating more than eight million views. And it has turned the woman   Dr. Judy Mikovits, 62, a discredited scientist   into a new star of virus disinformation.</p><p>Uploads of  Plandemic  have more than 8 million views across social platforms, with one YouTube version hitting 7.1 million views before it was removed. That would be more than enough to place it near the top of the YouTube trending page  about as many views as this video where influencers practice apologizing (8.6 million), but still way below the three-day-old official music video for 6ix9ine s  Gooba  (103 million).</p><p>Still, the video seems well on its way to becoming something akin to this generation s Loose Change. That video, which wrongly depicted 9/11 as an elaborate false flag operation, generated millions of views after being distributed for free on YouTube and local Fox TV affiliates   and went on to become one of the foundational texts of the 9/11 truther movement.</p><p>I accept that on a free and open internet, some people are going to post extremely dumb and harmful things. And  Plandemic  is undoubtedly harmful: among other things, it falsely tells people that wearing a mask will  activate  the virus. But we ve seen in the past that extremely dumb and harmful things often benefit from algorithmic promotion. They appear high up in search results, on trending pages, and in recommendation widgets. Platforms are used to recruit followers for terrible causes without even being aware that they re doing so.</p><p>After years of pressure, though, platforms have gotten better at detecting bad posts and videos as they begin bubbling up. They re now able to catch more bad stuff before it hits the trending page. YouTube has a whole team that monitors this stuff in real time. And so  Plandemic  left me scratching my head. How did this thing go viral?</p><p>The ground was seeded by a book that Mikovits, the star of  Plandemic,  published last month. Plague of Corruption  frames Dr. Mikovits as a truth-teller fighting deception in science,  Alba writes, and it won approving coverage from far-right outlets including the Epoch Times, Gateway Pundit, and Next News Network.</p><p>But it was the  Plandemic  clip that turned Mikovits into a star (she s gained more than 130,000 Twitter followers in a month.) And the two have benefited each other: searches for Mikovits drove views of  Plandemic,  and viewings of  Plandemic  drove searches for Mikovits.</p><p>Erin Gallagher, a social media researcher who specializes in data visualizations, offers some clues. Gallagher used CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing public posts, to investigate when  Plandemic  began to surge on the network. She found that posts referencing it appeared most often in Facebook groups devoted to QAnon, anti-vaccine misinformation, and conspiracy theories in general.</p><p> The video spread from YouTube to Facebook thanks to highly active QAnon and conspiracy-related Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members which caused a massive cascade,  Gallagher writes.  Both platforms were instrumental in spreading viral medical misinformation. </p><p>YouTube and Facebook both ultimately removed the video, but their responses differed in notable ways. I spoke to representatives at both companies today, and here s what I learned.</p><p>At Facebook,  Plandemic  was demoted before it was removed. Demotion is a step that Facebook often takes with posts that seem bad for one reason or another but are not considered actively harmful. Maybe you posted an image in which someone is almost but not quite naked; maybe you suggested that people commit violence without coming right out and saying it. Since 2018 Facebook has intervened in an effort to prevent these types of posts from spreading, as part of an initiative to make it less appealing to post so-called  borderline content. </p><p>I don t know exactly what qualified  Plandemic  as borderline content initially, but a spokesman noted that the video s length   26 minutes   along with the large number of claims made within it, created a lot of work for fact-checking teams. (A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can tie its shoes, etc.) Facebook eventually decided that  Plandemic  had to go over its false assertion that people can  reinfect themselves  by wearing masks, but given the truly unfortunate confusion over mask wearing   some of it generated by public health organizations   the company was cautious.</p><p>At YouTube, the company saw several videos related to  Plandemic  and flagged and removed them before the 26-minute clip that became famous. That clip was uploaded on May 4th and removed May 6th. In the meantime, it generated 7.1 million views. According to the company, the vast majority of those views came from external sites   people linking to it directly, rather than seeing it somewhere on YouTube. Gallagher s analysis suggests a significant number of those clicks came directly from Facebook. (YouTube wouldn t comment on that.)</p><p>For its part, YouTube said, it did not recommend  Plandemic  or surface it  prominently  in search results   so, not on the first page. Search for it now and you ll see a pop-up from an independent fact checker and many videos of doctors debunking its claims.</p><p>Facebook continues to see people upload other clips from  Plandemic,  and told me that it is sharing fact-checking information from its partners with people who share them. It s temporarily reducing the distribution of these other clips   the ones that don t include the mask bit   as fact checkers continue to evaluate other parts of  Plandemic.  People also continue to post modified versions of the original   recording it on their phones or adding commentary to it   and Facebook is hunting those down too.</p><p>There s a view of all this that is heartening. Both companies saw a bad thing, put teams of fact checkers on it, and removed it from their networks with relative haste. (That s more than Amazon can say: Plague of Corruption is a top-10 best seller there today.) Facebook and YouTube could have acted faster, or more completely, but it isn t as if  Plandemic  caught them unawares. YouTube has more than 2 billion monthly users, and Facebook has 1.73 billion users per day across its suite of apps; at that scale, 8 million people seeing something in 48 hours just doesn t look like all that much. (And if you re thinking well huh, maybe the problem with these companies is their size, you may have been interested in Elizabeth Warren s presidential campaign.)</p><p>But there s a darker view to consider, too. When Facebook announced it would shift its attention to building services for smaller, more private groups, critics pointed out that this was likely going to make it harder to police misinformation. This is particularly true of WhatsApp chats, which are encrypted end-to-end. But it s also true of private Facebook groups, where it seems likely that  Plandemic  was shared actively.</p><p>It likely won t be the last piece of harmful misinformation about COVID-19 that becomes a blockbuster. And when the next one comes, I wouldn t be surprised to see that the pathway to virality leads straight through Facebook groups.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Formal apology to the people of the United Kingdom</emphasis></h><p>On Thursday, in reference to an app being developed by the digital division of the United Kingdom s National Health Service, I repeatedly used  England  when I should have referred to the entire kingdom.

These controversies have prompted regulators and consumers alike to question how much personal data big tech companies gather, how they put it to work, and how they store and manage it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This incident saw Cambridge Analytica harvest the personal data of millions of peoples' Facebook profiles without their consent and use it for microtargeted political campaigns. It's an example of how the speed of change in the technology market outpaces the ability of lawmakers and regulators to keep up.</p><p>The enactment of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 in response to personal data privacy concerns was a watershed moment, setting a benchmark for global data protection regulation that is likely to be emulated in many parts of the world. Yet the debate has already moved on.</p><p>Edward Snowden - the NSA-whistle blower living in exile in Russia after exposing America's mass surveillance programmes - for example, argues that we should not be looking only at protection of data. We should also ask whether this personal data should be collected in the first place, given that leaks or abuse of the data are inevitable.</p><p>He says that the underlying assumption of GDPR and similar data privacy laws is that \"the collection of data in the first place was proper, that it was appropriate and that it doesn't represent a threat or danger. That it's okay to spy on your customers or your citizens so long as it never leaks.\"</p><p>Reframing the debate</p><p>This point is one that digital marketers, regulators, big tech and privacy advocates are likely to vigorously debate in the years to come. It shifts the question to whether Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and other programmatic based platforms are correct to collect your information in the first instance rather than whether they are doing enough to protect your data from bad actors like Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>This reframing of the debate could have profound implications for digital marketing if it becomes increasingly difficult for programmatic platforms to collect data that enables brands to run highly targeted advertising campaigns. We could see lawmakers question whether the way these platforms gather and use data is truly in customers' best interests.</p><p>As powerful as these capabilities are, it is perhaps also time for marketers to question whether they should amass as much personal data as they can without asking whether their customers are in favour of it. Many leading brands believe that they could benefit from shifting from mass collection of data towards collecting data only with customers' consent.</p><p>The obvious drawback is that brands have less customer data to use for their targeted campaigns; the upside is that marketers can build trust among their customers by asking for permission and being transparent about how they collect and use data. They can overlay mass data with surveys and other tools to not only understand what customers are doing but why they are doing it.</p><p>Data captured via tags embedded within sites for targeted campaigns is still the most effective way to gather vast amounts of client data quickly. It will always be more efficient than survey-based data, but if regulation starts to move from protection to collection it is worth building the capability now in anticipation of that possibility.</p><p>Focus on the data that matters</p><p>Marketers can also focus on the most salient data rather than gathering information for its own sake. Consider the example of Facebook likes. Some marketers think that getting a lot of 'likes' on Facebook is a great way to gather a captive audience of good, qualified prospects. But one needs to ask how these likes were acquired and whether those that 'liked' to enter a competition are genuine leads and fans.</p><p>It's not necessary to gather 'likes' to market your product or service to a user on Facebook. You can reach him or her through a range of more precise targeting criteria that are far better qualified. I would rather have 80% less likes on my page if I knew that remaining 20% were genuine brand ambassadors.</p><p>One way to get richer data is to use survey data consumers knowingly provided to target ads on platforms such as Facebook. This can build trust with the customer, since they will have more control over how their data is used to target messages to them. The brand can still leverage the data the platform collects about the user, while using the data the user-supplied for more accurate and transparent engagements.</p><p>We work closely with platforms such as Google and Facebook, and believe their intentions are generally good. However, marketers also need to keep ahead of the evolving data privacy debate and position themselves for the best practices of tomorrow. Those that get it right will be able to both target their customers at a highly granular level and build trust in their brands by using data in a manner that respects concerns of consumers and regulators.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Bizcommunity.

These controversies have prompted regulators and consumers alike to question how much personal data big tech companies gather, how they put it to work, and how they store and manage it...</p><p><br/>-<br/>This incident saw Cambridge Analytica harvest the personal data of millions of peoples' Facebook profiles without their consent and use it for microtargeted political campaigns. It s an example of how the speed of change in the technology market outpaces the ability of lawmakers and regulators to keep up. <br/><br/>The enactment of the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 in response to personal data privacy concerns was a watershed moment, setting a benchmark for global data protection regulation that is likely to be emulated in many parts of the world. Yet the debate has already moved on. <br/><br/>Edward Snowden   the NSA-whistle blower living in exile in Russia after exposing America s mass surveillance programmes   for example, argues that we should not be looking only at protection of data. We should also ask whether this personal data should be collected in the first place, given that leaks or abuse of the data are inevitable. <br/><br/>He says that the underlying assumption of GDPR and similar data privacy laws is that  the collection of data in the first place was proper, that it was appropriate and that it doesn t represent a threat or danger. That it s okay to spy on your customers or your citizens so long as it never leaks. <br/><br/>Reframing the debate <br/><br/>This point is one that digital marketers, regulators, big tech and privacy advocates are likely to vigorously debate in the years to come. It shifts the question to whether Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and other programmatic based platforms are correct to collect your information in the first instance rather than whether they are doing enough to protect your data from bad actors like Cambridge Analytica. <br/><br/>This reframing of the debate could have profound implications for digital marketing if it becomes increasingly difficult for programmatic platforms to collect data that enables brands to run highly targeted advertising campaigns. We could see lawmakers question whether the way these platforms gather and use data is truly in customers  best interests. <br/><br/>As powerful as these capabilities are, it is perhaps also time for marketers to question whether they should amass as much personal data as they can without asking whether their customers are in favour of it. Many leading brands believe that they could benefit from shifting from mass collection of data towards collecting data only with customers  consent. <br/><br/>The obvious drawback is that brands have less customer data to use for their targeted campaigns; the upside is that marketers can build trust among their customers by asking for permission and being transparent about how they collect and use data. They can overlay mass data with surveys and other tools to not only understand what customers are doing but why they are doing it. <br/><br/>Data captured via tags embedded within sites for targeted campaigns is still the most effective way to gather vast amounts of client data quickly. It will always be more efficient than survey-based data, but if regulation starts to move from protection to collection it is worth building the capability now in anticipation of that possibility. <br/><br/>Focus on the data that matters <br/><br/>Marketers can also focus on the most salient data rather than gathering information for its own sake. Consider the example of Facebook likes. Some marketers think that getting a lot of  likes  on Facebook is a great way to gather a captive audience of good, qualified prospects. But one needs to ask how these likes were acquired and whether those that  liked  to enter a competition are genuine leads and fans. <br/><br/>It s not necessary to gather  likes  to market your product or service to a user on Facebook. You can reach him or her through a range of more precise targeting criteria that are far better qualified. I would rather have 80% less likes on my page if I knew that remaining 20% were genuine brand ambassadors.<br/><br/>One way to get richer data is to use survey data consumers knowingly provided to target ads on platforms such as Facebook. This can build trust with the customer, since they will have more control over how their data is used to target messages to them. The brand can still leverage the data the platform collects about the user, while using the data the user-supplied for more accurate and transparent engagements. <br/><br/>We work closely with platforms such as Google and Facebook, and believe their intentions are generally good. However, marketers also need to keep ahead of the evolving data privacy debate and position themselves for the best practices of tomorrow. Those that get it right will be able to both target their customers at a highly granular level and build trust in their brands by using data in a manner that respects concerns of consumers and regulators.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZSAM-1199532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZSAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY5-KBT1-DY06-84H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Marketing and Media)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13292\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They piled up astronomical profits while hypnotizing both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservative administrations praised them as modern versions of 19th- century risk- takers such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs and other tech giants were seen as supposedly creating national wealth in an unregulated, laissez- faire landscape that they had invented from nothing.</p><p>At a time when American companies were increasingly unable to compete in the rough-and-tumble world arena, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook bulldozed their international competition. Indeed, they turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p>The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley's monopolizing, outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of start-up competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions of dollars to left- wing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook and Google were able to warp their own social media protocols and Internet searches to insidiously favor progressive agendas and messaging.</p><p>If the left feared the tech billionaires were becoming robber barons, they also delighted in the fact that they were at least left-wing robber barons.</p><p>Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p>As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight.</p><p>Big Tech certainly was not subject to the rules that governed railroads, power companies, trucking industries, Wall Street, and television and radio.</p><p>But attitudes about hip high-tech corporations have now changed on both the left and right.</p><p>Liberals are under pressure from their progressive base to make Silicon Valley hire more minorities and women.</p><p>Progressives wonder why West Coast techies cannot unionize and sit down for tough bargaining with their progressive billionaire bosses.</p><p>Local community groups resent the tech giants driving up housing prices and zoning out the poor from cities such as Seattle and San Francisco.</p><p>Behind the veneer of a cool Apple logo or multicolored Google trademark are scores of multimillionaires who live one- percenter lifestyles quite at odds with the soft socialism espoused by their corporate megaphones.</p><p>Conservatives got sick of Silicon Valley, too.</p><p>Instead of acting like laissez-faire capitalists, the entrenched captains of high-tech industry seem more like government colluders and manipulators. Regarding the hightech leaders' efforts to rig their industries and strangle dissent, think of conniving Jay Gould or Jim Fisk rather than the wizard Thomas Edison.</p><p>With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trust- busting zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>The public, so far, has welcomed the unregulated freedom of Silicon Valley - as long as it was truly free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated - by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p>The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p>For years, high- tech grandees dressed all in hip black while prancing around the stage, enthralling stockholders as if they were rock stars performing with wireless mics. Some wore jeans, sneakers and T-shirts, making it seem like being worth $50 billion was hipster cool.</p><p>But the billionaire-as-everyman shtick has lost his groove, especially when such zillionaires lavish their pet political candidates with huge donations, seed lobbying groups and demand regulatory loopholes.</p><p>Ten years ago, a carefree Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T- shirt get- up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p>Of course, Silicon Valley's critics should be wary. They wonder whether the golden tech goose can be caged without being killed.</p><p>Both liberals and conservatives are just beginning to ask why internet communications cannot be subject to the same rules applied to radio and television.</p><p>Why can't Silicon Valley monopolies be busted up in the same manner as the Bell Telephone octopus or the old Standard Oil trust?</p><p>Why are high-tech profits hidden in offshore accounts? Why is production outsourced to impoverished countries, sometimes in workplaces that are deplorable and cruel? Why does texting while driving not earn a product liability suit?</p><p>Just because Silicon Valley is cool does not mean it could never become just another monopoly that got too greedy and turned off the left wing, the right wing and everybody in between.</p><p>Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution and Stanford University and the author of \"The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern.\"</p><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-10021705art0xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289793532C3DD9 NWBKCT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PM8-8MX1-JBCN-40S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Chronicle Printing Company<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It was the year that marked the start of the greatest financial calamity in a century, with the first run on a British bank since 1866 as Northern Rock fell victim to the early throes of America's sub-prime contagion. And it was the year that Apple released the iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade since, the world has changed beyond imagination. As governments fought the fires of the crisis, big banks were ceding their throne to big technology, which was quietly remaking the global order.</p><p>If the banks were once masters of the universe, they were nothing compared with what followed. We now live in a smartphone world, tied together by social media, Face Time and GPS and by big tech's web of manufacturing supply chains on which economies today rise and fall, ruling all before it with a monopolistic power that defies regulation.</p><p>Financial globalisation gave bankers a vast playground in which to take perilous risks with people's future. Today's titans go further. They own the future.</p><p>The scale of big tech is nothing short of remarkable. Last year, 1.5 billion smartphones were sold, enough for every fifth person on earth. Mobile technology and services contributed $3.6 trillion to world output, 4.5 per cent of global GDP, as the International Monetary Fund set out this week. One sixth of the growth in global trade in 2017 was down to smartphones alone. For several Asian countries, it is their economy. Production of smartphone components in South Korea accounted for a third of GDP growth last year. In Taiwan, it was 40 per cent. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are all similarly dependent on the industry. Wearable tech, autonomous vehicles and the internet of things will only increase its dominance.</p><p>Technology's influence may be easily quantifiable in Asia, but it is not limited to the region. The backlash against globalisation, evident in the populist uprisings in the west against factory closures and mass unemployment, has not been about trade, according to the IMF. \"These trends, in our view, are more due to technology,\" Maurice Obstfeld, the fund's economic counsellor, said this week.</p><p>Technology is doing nothing less than changing the way the world works, killing some jobs and creating others. That has always been the way in an industrial revolution, but it is happening at a pace too fast to manage today. It is even challenging conventional economics. The clearest example has been the impact of online shopping on inflation. Immediate price comparison has made competition fiercer than ever, to the benefit of consumers but the dismay of central banks as they try to lift inflation to their 2 per cent targets.</p><p>What goes for the shops goes for jobs as well. One explanation for why wage inflation is so weak across big economies is that the internet has created a deeper labour pool than was possible ever before. Some economists reckon that companies list vacancies on job sites that they have no intention of filling simply to test demand. Technology has even made GDP outdated. Free services like the maps, cameras and photos that come as standard on a smartphone may have reduced measurable growth and played a part in the chronically weak productivity that has beset the west. The gains are accruing, instead, to the unmeasured parts of people's lives, like leisure, by expanding access to information and improving variety. Travel agents are vanishing, but people still book holidays and there's no need to waste time on a trip to the shops if you can browse from home. It is no coincidence that leisure has been growing steadily as a share of GDP.</p><p>Were policymakers to be honest, they would admit that nobody quite understands the world any longer. By comparison, the financial crisis was straightforward. Banks were innovating, sure, but the disaster was caused by an active decision to relax regulation and chase debt-fuelled growth. The remedies were hard, but obvious. Today's technology giants, with their globally mobile intellectual property assets, can outsmart policymakers and operate on an altogether different scale to the banks. If Apple, Amazon and Google were countries, they would be the 17th, 19th and 20th largest in the world respectively by market value, ahead of Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and Sweden. Facebook would be the 26th, just behind Belgium.</p><p>The tech titans are monopolies unlike any seen since Standard Oil in the early 20th century. Facebook has two billion users, Google accounts for 90 per cent of online searches in Europe, Apple has 250 million subscribers to its various services and 100 million people have signed up to Amazon Prime. To put that in context, Britain's population is 65 million.</p><p>Yet, unlike Standard Oil, which regulators split into 34 companies, you can't break up the tech giants. \"When most of the assets have intangible value and when the benefits from those assets are derived using particular mechanisms that themselves are completely intangible, how do you do the breaking up?\" Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, asked this week.</p><p>Besides, the networking effect of the platform model naturally gravitates towards a monopoly.

It was the year that marked the start of the greatest financial calamity in a century, with the first run on a British bank since 1866 as Northern Rock fell victim to the early throes of America's sub-prime contagion. And it was the year that Apple released the iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade since, the world has changed beyond imagination. As governments fought the fires of the crisis, big banks were ceding their throne to big technology, which was quietly remaking the global order.</p><p>If the banks were once masters of the universe, they were nothing compared with what followed. We now live in a smartphone world, tied together by social media, Face Time and GPS and by big tech's web of manufacturing supply chains on which economies today rise and fall, ruling all before it with a monopolistic power that defies regulation.</p><p>Financial globalisation gave bankers a vast playground in which to take perilous risks with people's future. Today's titans go further. They own the future.</p><p>The scale of big tech is nothing short of remarkable. Last year, 1.5billion smartphones were sold, enough for every fifth person on earth. Mobile technology and services contributed $3.6trillion to world output, 4.5 per cent of global GDP, as the International Monetary Fund set out this week. One sixth of the growth in global trade in 2017 was down to smartphones alone. For several Asian countries, it is their economy. Production of smartphone components in South Korea accounted for a third of GDP growth last year. In Taiwan, it was 40 per cent. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are all similarly dependent on the industry. Wearable tech, autonomous vehicles and the internet of things will only increase its dominance.</p><p>Technology's influence may be easily quantifiable in Asia, but it is not limited to the region. The backlash against globalisation, evident in the populist uprisings in the west against factory closures and mass unemployment, has not been about trade, according to the IMF. \"These trends, in our view, are more due to technology,\" Maurice Obstfeld, the fund's economic counsellor, said this week.</p><p>Technology is doing nothing less than changing the way the world works, killing some jobs and creating others. That has always been the way in an industrial revolution, but it is happening at a pace too fast to manage today. It is even challenging conventional economics. The clearest example has been the impact of online shopping on inflation. Immediate price comparison has made competition fiercer than ever, to the benefit of consumers but the dismay of central banks as they try to lift inflation to their 2 per cent targets.</p><p>What goes for the shops goes for jobs as well. One explanation for why wage inflation is so weak across big economies is that the internet has created a deeper labour pool than was possible ever before. Some economists reckon that companies list vacancies on job sites that they have no intention of filling simply to test demand. Technology has even made GDP outdated. Free services like the maps, cameras and photos that come as standard on a smartphone may have reduced measurable growth and played a part in the chronically weak productivity that has beset the west. The gains are accruing, instead, to the unmeasured parts of people's lives, like leisure, by expanding access to information and improving variety. Travel agents are vanishing, but people still book holidays and there's no need to waste time on a trip to the shops if you can browse from home. It is no coincidence that leisure has been growing steadily as a share of GDP.</p><p>Were policymakers to be honest, they would admit that nobody quite understands the world any longer. By comparison, the financial crisis was straightforward. Banks were innovating, sure, but the disaster was caused by an active decision to relax regulation and chase debt-fuelled growth. The remedies were hard, but obvious. Today's technology giants, with their globally mobile intellectual property assets, can outsmart policymakers and operate on an altogether different scale to the banks. If Apple, Amazon and Google were countries, they would be the 17th, 19th and 20th largest in the world respectively by market value, ahead of Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and Sweden. Facebook would be the 26th, just behind Belgium.</p><p>The tech titans are monopolies unlike any seen since Standard Oil in the early 20th century. Facebook has two billion users, Google accounts for 90 per cent of online searches in Europe, Apple has 250million subscribers to its various services and 100million people have signed up to Amazon Prime. To put that in context, Britain's population is 65 million.</p><p>Yet, unlike Standard Oil, which regulators split into 34 companies, you can't break up the tech giants. \"When most of the assets have intangible value and when the benefits from those assets are derived using particular mechanisms that themselves are completely intangible, how do you do the breaking up?\" Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, asked this week.</p><p>Besides, the networking effect of the platform model naturally gravitates towards a monopoly. Consumers want an everything store, like Amazon, a social network where they can find all their friends, like Facebook, or a search engine that is being constantly improved by other people's searches, like Google. As for regulation, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is right. Too much will kill start-ups, not big tech. But so is Ms Lagarde.

It was the year that marked the start of the greatest financial calamity in a century, with the first run on a British bank since 1866 as Northern Rock fell victim to the early throes of America's sub-prime contagion. And it was the year that Apple released the iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade since, the world has changed beyond imagination. As governments fought the fires of the crisis, big banks were ceding their throne to big technology, which was quietly remaking the global order.</p><p>If the banks were once masters of the universe, they were nothing compared with what followed. We now live in a smartphone world, tied together by social media, Face Time and GPS and by big tech's web of manufacturing supply chains on which economies today rise and fall, ruling all before it with a monopolistic power that defies regulation.</p><p>Financial globalisation gave bankers a vast playground in which to take perilous risks with people's future. Today's titans go further. They own the future.</p><p>The scale of big tech is nothing short of remarkable. Last year, 1.5billion smartphones were sold, enough for every fifth person on earth. Mobile technology and services contributed $3.6trillion to world output, 4.5 per cent of global GDP, as the International Monetary Fund set out this week. One sixth of the growth in global trade in 2017 was down to smartphones alone. For several Asian countries, it is their economy. Production of smartphone components in South Korea accounted for a third of GDP growth last year. In Taiwan, it was 40 per cent.</p><p>Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are all similarly dependent on the industry. Wearable tech, autonomous vehicles and the internet of things will only increase its dominance.</p><p>Technology's influence may be easily quantifiable in Asia, but it is not limited to the region. The backlash against globalisation, evident in the populist uprisings in the west against factory closures and mass unemployment, has not been about trade, according to the IMF. \"These trends, in our view, are more due to technology,\" Maurice Obstfeld, the fund's economic counsellor, said this week.</p><p>Technology is doing nothing less than changing the way the world works, killing some jobs and creating others. That has always been the way in an industrial revolution, but it is happening at a pace too fast to manage today. It is even challenging conventional economics. The clearest example has been the impact of online shopping on inflation. Immediate price comparison has made competition fiercer than ever, to the benefit of consumers but the dismay of central banks as they try to lift inflation to their 2 per cent targets.</p><p>What goes for the shops goes for jobs as well. One explanation for why wage inflation is so weak across big economies is that the internet has created a deeper labour pool than was possible ever before. Some economists reckon that companies list vacancies on job sites that they have no intention of filling simply to test demand. Technology has even made GDP outdated. Free services like the maps, cameras and photos that come as standard on a smartphone may have reduced measurable growth and played a part in the chronically weak productivity that has beset the west. The gains are accruing, instead, to the unmeasured parts of people's lives, like leisure, by expanding access to information and improving variety. Travel agents are vanishing, but people still book holidays and there's no need to waste time on a trip to the shops if you can browse from home. It is no coincidence that leisure has been growing steadily as a share of GDP.</p><p>Were policymakers to be honest, they would admit that nobody quite understands the world any longer. By comparison, the financial crisis was straightforward. Banks were innovating, sure, but the disaster was caused by an active decision to relax regulation and chase debt-fuelled growth. The remedies were hard, but obvious. Today's technology giants, with their globally mobile intellectual property assets, can outsmart policymakers and operate on an altogether different scale to the banks. If Apple, Amazon and Google were countries, they would be the 17th, 19th and 20th largest in the world respectively by market value, ahead of Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and Sweden. Facebook would be the 26th, just behind Belgium.</p><p>The tech titans are monopolies unlike any seen since Standard Oil in the early 20th century. Facebook has two billion users, Google accounts for 90 per cent of online searches in Europe, Apple has 250million subscribers to its various services and 100million people have signed up to Amazon Prime. To put that in context, Britain's population is 65 million.</p><p>Yet, unlike Standard Oil, which regulators split into 34 companies, you can't break up the tech giants. \"When most of the assets have intangible value and when the benefits from those assets are derived using particular mechanisms that themselves are completely intangible, how do you do the breaking up?\" Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, asked this week.</p><p>Besides, the networking effect of the platform model naturally gravitates towards a monopoly. Consumers want an everything store, like Amazon, a social network where they can find all their friends, like Facebook, or a search engine that is being constantly improved by other people's searches, like Google. As for regulation, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is right. Too much will kill start-ups, not big tech. But so is Ms Lagarde. Too much power and too little competition is bad for both the economy and \"the wellbeing of individuals\".</p><p>Fixing the problem will require completely new ideas. The proposal from Luigi Zingales, of the University of Chicago, that social media users own their data and can port it from one site to another as we do mobile phone numbers might be a start, but a small one. Yet the problem is bigger still than the conceptual challenge. These companies, the corporate states that they have become, are now so enmeshed in our lives and our economies that reform is almost insurmountable. Ms Lagarde says new thinking is needed \"and quickly\". It may already be too late.

I'm Melissa Block.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, the rating agency Standard and Poor's downgraded the United States. By Monday, the stock market was in freefall. S&amp;P insists it's simply pointing out the obvious problems with U.S. debt and government gridlock. But the process highlights how private companies like rating agencies can shake nations with nothing more than a press release.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Robert Smith from NPR's Planet Money team has a short history of how the rating agencies got so much influence.</p><p>ROBERT SMITH: Just who gave Standard and Poor's the power, the muscle to kick sand in the face of the U.S. government? Oh yeah, it was the U.S. government itself.</p><p>LAWRENCE WHITE: There's some ironies, shall we say, in all of this.</p><p>SMITH: Professor Lawrence J. White, from the NYU Stern School of Business, says you have to go back a hundred years to see exactly how it happened. In fact, you have to go to the big tech bubble of the 1800s.</p><p>WHITE: Railroads.</p><p>SMITH: The rating agencies that now make grown investment bankers tremble were once a bunch of railroad geeks.</p><p>WHITE: There were a lot of railroads out there and investors wanted to know, so who were guys who are likely to pay me back?</p><p>SMITH: And who are the criminals who will take my money on a one-way trip out West? Enter the unfortunately named Henry Varnum Poor. Yes, he's the second half of Standard and Poor's. In 1860, he published a giant book of nothing but financial details of railroads. Finally, there was a way to start to make sense of the industry.</p><p>In 1909, another famous name, John Moody, would jump into the railroad reporting business too. He was the first one to use those letter grades. He was followed by Fitch. Standard joined up with Poor. Professor White says all the names you might know in the rating business today got started back then.</p><p>WHITE: By the 1920s, the stock market is booming. So, there's this need for more and more information on the part of lenders - who is a good risk, who is not?</p><p>SMITH: But back then, the rating of a loan was just a service that investors paid for. It didn't have the make-or-break power that it has today. The U.S. government changed all that.</p><p>After the stock market crash of 1929 and the start of the Depression, the U.S. government started to regulate the health of the banks. And they said if you're going to hold bonds of railroads or any other company, they have to be of good quality. But here's the catch - White says the bonds had to be rated by one of these private agencies.</p><p>WHITE: It was outsourced. It was delegated to this handful - literal, handful - of third-party private sector rating firms.</p><p>SMITH: We might never have heard of Standard or Poor or Moody if the U.S. government hadn't enshrined them really with a special status. Private businesses but also serving this public function of validating debt.</p><p>Now, Professor White says that they were pretty good at their jobs. Historical analysis shows that rating agencies generally were right on separating the good loans from the bad. But the business started to change in the late 1960s. Instead of charging investors, the rating agencies started to take money from the issuers of the bonds - from the people they were judging.</p><p>And Professor White blames the Xerox.</p><p>WHITE: High-speed photocopy machine, no question.</p><p>SMITH: The ratings agencies were afraid, he says, that investors would just pass around their information for free. So they had to start making money from the company side. Even this seemed to work for years, until the big scandals of the last decade. The rating agencies missed Enron's impending bankruptcy.

And that could make them an even bigger target in Washington.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coronavirus's economic wreckage is poised to boost the dominance of tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon - and their risks of an antitrust collision with Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic has hit the biggest tech companies too, of course, with both Google and Facebook reporting this week that their digital ad revenue plunged as the economy began shutting down in March. But their smaller tech rivals are suffering far worse - as are the ad-dependent media companies that have shed tens of thousands of jobs and the vast numbers of brick-and-mortar retailers that may never reopen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result is a looming economic imbalance that could provide even more fuel for antitrust hawks from both parties, who say the leading tech companies have spent years abusing their power by bullying and buying up rivals. And that was before the outbreak reinforced society's growing dependence on the tech industry, leaving millions more Americans buying essential supplies from Amazon while using apps from Facebook, Google and Microsoft to communicate, attend school or conduct business.</p><p>\"My nightmare scenario is an economic shock that leaves every Main Street firm without Wall Street connections, and every tech startup that is trying to compete with the big guys, starved for cash and vulnerable to predatory acquisition,\" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a statement to POLITICO. \"We can't stand by and let Amazon, Facebook, Google, and all the rest gobble up all the innovators in our economy.\"</p><p>The virus \"has unmasked how big and powerful these companies are,\" said Rachel Bovard, a senior adviser to the Internet Accountability Project, a conservative group partially funded by Oracle that is pushing for antitrust tech probes. \"It's proving that the antitrust scrutiny is either warranted or should be enhanced. ... It will be especially true when we get on the other side and look at the wreckage of small businesses.\"</p><p>The companies see their roles in the crisis in a much more positive light. \"What we do as a company can make a big difference in people's lives,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in an April 16 letter to shareholders.</p><p>For now, though, these are just some of the ways that Facebook, Google and Amazon - along with fellow tech A-listers Apple and Microsoft - could emerge from the crisis even larger:</p><p>They are rich enough to weather the storm</p><p>Google and Facebook both say their ad revenue is likely to remain depressed as retail, hospitality, travel and other companies scale back their spending. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg even expressed worries about the wider economy, telling investors on an earnings call Wednesday that \"I remain very concerned that this health emergency and the economic fallout will last longer than people are expecting.\"</p><p>But Facebook and its fellow internet titans have a huge advantage over most other companies: piles of cash.</p><p>Google's parent Alphabet had $117 billion on hand at the end of March, while Facebook had more than $60 billion - greater than the gross domestic products of Lebanon, Slovenia or Tanzania. Amazon reported $24.3 billion in free cash flow. That money will help the companies to stave off the layoffs and closures that have sent unemployment soaring to Great Depression levels.</p><p>\"Google and Facebook could have revenue decline 20 or 25 percent year-over-year, and not have to worry about going out of business,\" said Mark Mahaney, managing director at RBC Capital Markets. \"More than any other ad-driven business model, Google and Facebook can afford whatever comes out of Covid.\"</p><p>Their competitors are shrinking or vanishing</p><p>Yelp - a longtime critic of Google with antitrust regulators - laid off one-third of its workforce and furloughed another 1,100 employees this month as its revenue from small-business ads shriveled. TripAdvisor, another Google detractor, said it will lay off 900 employees and furlough many of its remaining U.S. workers. Uber, which competes with Google sibling Waymo in developing self-driving cars, is also considering steep layoffs, The Information reported this week.</p><p>The plight is even worse for media companies whose ad dollars were already dwindling amid competition from Google and Facebook. Some estimates place the number of U.S. journalists laid off because of the pandemic at more than 33,000. News Corp. - one of the most vocal anti-Google publishers - suspended print editions of 60 of its newspapers in Australia, though U.S. operations and the flagship Wall Street Journal have yet to see cuts.</p><p>Startups are also aching, with roughly 30,000 of their workers laid off across the country since the beginning of March. In a note Monday, the National Venture Capital Association said investments in fledgling companies is likely to \"drop significantly,\" adding that \"companies will shut down - at a higher rate than what is inherent to this risky industry.\"</p><p> And Amazon is poised to have many fewer competitors when the outbreak ends: As many as 100,000 retail outlets are likely to close in the next five years, UBS research analysts suggested in a note last week, as the coast-to-coast shutdowns hasten the trend of shoppers moving online. Some long-established retail names may never recover from the pandemic: The Gap, the San Francisco clothing chain that owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said last week that it expects to shutter some locations permanently, while J.C. Penney skipped paying interest on bonds this month - the first step toward a bankruptcy filing.</p><p>Even when the economy recovers, the big guys will be the first to reap the benefits.</p><p>Facebook and Google are poised to bounce back faster than other ad-supported businesses, said Jasmine Enberg, senior analyst at eMarketer. Their platforms allow marketers to essentially flip a switch on online ads, so as easily as they could halt them, they can get them running again. The two companies already control 60 percent of the online advertising market, eMarketer estimates.</p><p>\"Whenever there's economic uncertainty, advertisers tend to turn to these tried-and-true platforms and they're less likely to be experimental,\" she said. \"Facebook and Google, at this point, are considered to be essential platforms for advertisers.\"</p><p>The crisis may set the stage for buying sprees</p><p>Amid the last recession, tech companies used their reserves to buy up businesses at a higher clip than normal, with Google scooping up a record 36 companies, according to an analysis by CIO Dive.</p><p>Now, the big tech companies will once again have a chance to go bargain hunting - scarfing up talent, intellectual property and rival businesses at much reduced prices. Both Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said during an earnings calls this week that they would look to invest throughout the downturn, even while slowing hiring in areas other than engineering and product management.</p><p>\"One of the harder issues for antitrust will be how to manage mergers and acquisitions coming out of this crisis,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser for the advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"Certainly, the big tech firms are sitting on boatloads of cash and they could buy if they thought it made sense. There may be a lot of floundering smaller players.\"</p><p>Many of these deals could fly under regulators' radar, even though mergers exceeding $94 million in value usually have to undergo reviews by the Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission. The law contains exemptions, including one that Bloomberg says allowed Google to avoid scrutiny of a 2010 acquisition that helped it cement its dominance in advertising technology.</p><p>Public Knowledge has suggested that Congress lower the dollar amounts on deals that require reviews, while Democrats including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and House antitrust chairman David Cicilline of Rhode Island are pushing to halt almost all corporate mergers during the outbreak. \"We need to stop the big tech companies from bulldozing the competition during this pandemic - and we need to break up big tech,\" Warren told POLITICO in a statement. Some Republicans have rejected that idea, including FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips, who has said data shows merger-and-acquisition activity is actually down. \"This is a very odd time to be calling to shut down M&amp;A entirely, in particular because of the important role that it can help in the economy,\" Phillips told CNBC this week. </p><p>The big players can change the rules - for their own benefit</p><p>For the many businesses that have grown to depend on the giants, the biggest frustration is how readily the big players change the rules as they go.</p><p>That's especially apparent with Amazon, which has spent years encouraging third-party sellers to store and move their products through its own warehouses and logistics network. The \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" program offered the sellers higher ratings, access to Amazon Prime customers and more prominent placement under Amazon's algorithms.</p><p>Then, in mid-March, Amazon cut them off, saying priority for warehouse space would go to \"essential goods\" such as groceries and sanitation supplies needed during the pandemic. That left many sellers without their biggest sales channel or, in some cases, no way to do business, said Shaoul Sussman, a lawyer representing an Amazon seller in a House Judiciary Committee probe of tech platforms.</p><p>Even for sellers that could fulfill orders themselves, Amazon's algorithm still gave its own products preference over those of rivals that could ship more quickly, due to what the company called an \"error.\" And at a time of soaring demand for products, Amazon downgraded the listings and ratings for sellers whose products sold out at the warehouse, Sussman said.</p><p>Amazon has said it is working on reopening its warehouses to the sellers and correcting their ratings. Meanwhile, the company has taken steps to assist sellers by waiving certain fees and pausing loan repayments, a spokesperson said.</p><p>\"The temporary changes to our logistics network to meet increased demand resulting from Covid-19 were not designed to advantage Amazon brands, retail vendors or sellers - they have been based on how to best serve customers during the outbreak while helping ensure the health and safety of our employees,\" the Amazon spokesperson said. </p><p>Google has also faced criticism over how it implemented advertising bans related to the coronavirus, under a policy on \"sensitive\" topics that ended up blocking government public service announcements and left news videos about the pandemic without ad revenue.</p><p>Both Google and Facebook declined to comment for this story.</p><p>We all need online services more</p><p>The coronavirus lockdowns have introduced millions of people to videoconferencing, streaming and online grocery delivery services - building habits that may last long after the pandemic fades.</p><p>Amazon, with its vast network of distribution centers and Whole Foods grocery stores, is adding 175,000 workers to keep pace with consumer demand. Facebook says a record 3 billion people have used its main social network plus Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger to connect online, while Amazon, Google and Apple own video-streaming services that have helped take the place of movie theaters, concerts and live sports.  </p><p>That's on top of all the businesses that have shifted their operations online, relying on cloud services and workplace productivity tools as employees are forced to work from home.</p><p>All this is a bright spot for society, said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, adding that tech companies are providing services that consumers highly value during the pandemic.</p><p>\"We're reaping the benefits of decades of smart tech policy which has fostered a competitive industry,\" said Schruers, whose group counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as members.</p><p>Can they win over the regulators?</p><p>That means the tech giants have a new opportunity to amass goodwill.  Some recent polls suggest the reputations of big tech companies are improving, and policymakers in the U.S. and Europe who once maligned the industry are now seeking tech companies' help to track coronavirus cases, supply essential equipment or crunch data in the search for a vaccine. The CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook were among the dozens of corporate leaders tapped to advise the Trump administration as it plans to reopen the economy.</p><p>Industry supporters hope the halo effect will erode Washington's appetite for new regulations once the crisis ends. And they say now is not the time to threaten companies that are helping keep smaller businesses alive.</p><p>\"I would caution that now, particularly now, is not the time to create more uncertainty in the small business community,\" said Jake Ward, president of the Connected Commerce Council, which represents 5,400 digitally enabled small businesses and counts Amazon, Google and Facebook among its supporters.</p><p>Others doubt that the glow will last. Public Knowledge's Kimmelman noted that AT&amp;T was massively popular with consumers before the Justice Department broke it up in the 1980s.</p><p>\"We have a history of challenging even the most popular companies if they are violating the law,\" he said. \"Post-coronavirus, we are going to have a few dominant retailers and a few dominant online distributors of news, information and content. That's what we need to address.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-227508</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-4G01-F118-92GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2218\"/><timeReceived>11:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, has his answer ready in his office at Christ Church College, in Oxford, England: \"I wouldn't say the internet has failed with a capital F but it has failed to deliver the positive, constructive society many of us had hoped for.\" Two decades ago he would have scoffed at the idea that the internet and the web would do anything but make this planet a better place. In his autobiography written in the late 1990s, Weaving the Web, he concluded: \"The experience of seeing the web take off by the grassroots effort of thousands gives me tremendous hope that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we can collectively make our world what we want.\" Until a few years ago most users, asked what they thought of the internet, would have rattled off a list of the things they loved about it: that it lets them stay in touch with friends, provides instant access to a huge range of information, sparks innovation, even helps undermine authoritarian regimes. </p><p>And in some ways it has been a tremendous success. Just under a quarter of a century after the first web browser was released, about half the world's population is online. But like Berners-Lee, many people recently have become more critical of the internet, concerned that it creates online addicts, hoovers up everybody's data and empowers malicious trolls and hackers.</p><p>At the heart of their disenchantment is that the internet has become much more \"centralised\" (in the tech crowd's terminology) than it was even 10 years ago. Both in the West and in China, the activities this global network of networks makes possible are dominated by a few giants, from Facebook to Tencent. In his latest book, The Square and the Tower, historian Niall Ferguson says that this pattern - a disruptive new network being infiltrated by a new hierarchy - has many historical precedents. Examples range from the invention of the printing press to the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>At the same time the internet has become much more strictly controlled. When access to it was still mainly via desktop or laptop computers, users could stumble across amazing new services and try many things for themselves.</p><p>These days the main way of getting online is via smartphones and tablets that confine users to carefully circumscribed spaces, or \"walled gardens\", which are hardly more exciting than television channels. Makers of mobile operating systems can decide through their app stores which services smartphone owners have access to. Another control point is cloud computing, which by its nature puts outsiders in charge of applications and their associated data. Meanwhile governments, which long played no part in the internet, have established power over large parts of the network, often using big internet firms as willing enforcers, for instance by getting them to block unwelcome content.</p><p>This is more or less the opposite of what the early cyber gurus had intended. When the first message was sent over the internet nearly a half-century ago, on October 29, 1969, the system was \"biased in favour of decentralisation of power and freedom to act\", according to Yochai Benkler of Harvard University. Its technological roots played a large part in that. A child of the Cold War, the internet was meant to connect disparate networks and computers so they could still communicate even if central links became unavailable, say in the event of a nuclear attack. \"We wanted anything connected to the net to connect to anything else connected to the net,\" says Vint Cerf, one of the engineers who developed the communication protocols (he now works for Google).</p><p>To make this possible, Cerf and his colleagues had to make the internet \"permissionless\", in today's lingo. Any network and any computer can join in as long as it follows the protocols. Packets of data are handed from one network to another, regardless of content. This loosely coupled architecture later inspired Berners-Lee, who devised the protocols for the world wide web that work on top of the internet proper.</p><p>Those protocols were complemented by a set of organisations that allowed the rules to evolve, along with the software that puts them into effect, and keep both from being captured by outside interests. Chief among them has been the Internet Engineering Task Force, whose philosophy was perfectly summed up by David Clark, one of its founders: \"We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\" The combination of open technical rules and flexible governance set off a frenzy of creativity and innovation. Starting in the mid-1990s, millions of websites were set up and tens of thousands of start-ups were launched. Even after the dotcom bubble collapsed in the early 2000s, this decentralised activity continued unabated, for instance in the form of blogs. Users actually did what Berners-Lee had hoped they would: publish online and link to each other, creating a great virtual conversation.</p><p>Today the internet is a very different beast. The connections to transfer information still exist, as do the protocols, but the extensions the internet has spawned now greatly outweigh the original network: billions of smartphones and other devices, and cloud-computing factories the size of football fields, containing unimaginable quantities of data. The best way to picture all this is as a vast collection of data silos with big pipes between them, connected to all kinds of devices that deliver services and collect more data.</p><p>The centralisation of the internet and the growing importance of data has given rise to what Frank Pasquale of the University of Maryland, in a recent paper published in American Affairs, calls a \"Jeffersonian-Hamiltonian divide\" among critics of big tech. One group stands in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, one of America's founding fathers, who favoured smaller government and less concentration in business. Its members want to rein in the tech titans through tougher antitrust policies, including breakups. The other group follows the thinking of Alexander Hamilton, another founding father, who supported strong central institutions, both in politics and in the economy. Its adherents argue that to reap the benefits of artificial intelligence and distribute them fairly, online -giants should be treated as utilities.</p><p>Jefferson v Hamilton This framing also helps to understand the reactions to centralisation more generally. The Jeffersonian side worries that a centralised internet offers less scope for innovation. Although the online giants themselves are a source of much invention, they dampen it elsewhere, so that fewer new ideas are being tried. Venture capitalists now talk about \"kill zones\", areas they will not invest in because one of the big players may squeeze the life out of start-ups or buy them up at a low price.</p><p>The political consequences of the internet's growing centralisation are even more troublesome, if less obvious. Walled gardens often limit free speech, as Facebook's sometimes ham-fisted attempts to police its social network have shown. Having to hack the algorithms of only a few platforms makes it easier for Russian trolls and their Western counterparts to meddle in elections by spreading misinformation. The concentration of reams of personal data in one place makes serious leaks likelier. One example is the recent scandal at Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that acquired data on 87 million Facebook users in underhand ways (and as a result went out of business). Dominant platforms are also handy for spooks, as shown by the revelations in 2013 by Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee who leaked vast amounts of classified information. Intelligence services had to tap into only a couple of computing clouds to find what they wanted. And online giants have plenty of cash to influence offline politics.</p><p>Yet among Jeffersonians, a sense of a new beginning is also in the air. The buzz at technology conferences today is reminiscent of 1995, shortly after the birth of the world wide web, when a new piece of software called a browser took the web mainstream, and the internet with it. At today's events, start-ups are pushing ambitious plans, often based on blockchain technology (immutable distributed ledgers of the sort that underlie Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies), promising to \"re-decentralise\" the online world.</p><p>Hamiltonians, on the other hand, say that without the free services and easy-to-use interfaces offered by companies such as Google and Facebook, far fewer people would be using the internet. Without cloud computing, which lets firms crunch vast quantities of data, AI would be nowhere. Having a few powerful firms in control also helps curb the demons of decentralisation, such as cybercrime and hate speech. This kind of thinking, long used by online -giants to make the case against regulation, has gained some traction on the left in the West. But it is mostly thriving in China, where the government wants tech titans to help it in its quest to turn the country into a cyber superpower.</p><p>Tacking between the two sides is a growing group of academics who are trying to devise new ways to rein in big tech through regulation. Some of their proposals are more Jeffersonian, such as forcing firms to unwind recent mergers. Others are more Hamiltonian, including making companies share some of their data.</p><p>To re-decentralise the internet, ideas from all three camps are needed. There is no central solution.</p><p>Art of the possible Fixing the internet can look like mission impossible, even in the West. A Jeffersonian reform in the form of Web 3.0 appears a long way off, and its regulatory equivalent, a vigorous antitrust policy, does not look much more promising. Online, humanity seems bound to sink ever deeper into a Hamiltonian hole. But such an outcome is not inevitable.</p><p>It is important to set realistic expectations. Nobody seriously thinks the internet could ever return to its first, totally decentralised beginnings. Most markets are somewhat concentrated, and no technology is likely to change that. In the metaphor by Ferguson quoted, rather than tear down the data towers, the task at hand is to create a sufficiently vibrant digital town square to make diversity flourish.</p><p>Similarly, there is no single solution for decentralising the internet. But a decent-sized digital square could be maintained through a mix of measures, combining Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian approaches, as well as regulation. What might that look like?</p><p>Looking back, forcing the tech giants of the past to share some of their wealth seems to have been a good idea. Intel would have found it harder to develop microprocessors without a consent decree in 1956 that forced AT&amp;T, then America's telephone monopoly, to agree to license all its past patents free of charge, including the ones for the transistor. Microsoft might never have come to rule PC software if IBM, accused of monopolising mainframes, had not decided in 1969 to market computers and their programs separately, a move that created the software industry. Google might not have taken off in the way it did had Microsoft not agreed, at the end of its antitrust trials in the US and Europe in the 2000s, not to discriminate against rival browsers and to license technical information that allows other operating systems to work easily with Windows.</p><p>The equivalent course of action now would be to force today's -giants to open up their data vaults, thus lowering the barriers to market entry and giving newcomers a better chance to compete. A useful case study might be the EU's Second Payment Service Directive, which came into force early this year. On the old continent, big banks must now give other firms access to transaction data at the say so of an account holder.</p><p>Admittedly, designing a similar solution for the world of data would be tricky. Mandating extensive data-sharing would amount to expropriation. It also would clash with privacy considerations: the reason data on tens of millions of Americans leaked from Facebook ahead of the 2016 presidential election was that the applications on the firm's platform had some access to users' social graphs. But the information technology industry has solved more difficult problems in the past.</p><p>Equally important, governments must make it easier for decentralised alternatives to emerge. That could mean creating demand for such offerings by using them themselves or by mandating their use, for instance by requiring that some of them, such as -blockchain-based digital identities, are offered by big online service providers.</p><p>But it also means doing away with regulation that ends up strengthening existing online -giants.</p><p>In the US, the Computer Fraud and Abuse act and Digital Millennium Copyright makes it an offence, punishable by prison, for outside firms to plug into the platforms of online giants. Such legislation should be dispensed with.</p><p>It is also unhelpful to treat all crypto-tokens as securities and regulate them as such, as the US's Securities and Exchange Commission seems set to do. Exceptions should be made for those that are clearly intended to power new types of services. The EU may need to tweak its brand new General Data Protection Regulation to make it less complex. Big firms have the resources to comply with its rules, whereas smaller outfits are likely to struggle.</p><p>The internet's physical infrastructure is still less concentrated than the applications that run on top of the network, and every effort should be made to keep it that way.</p><p>The US's recent decision to scrap strict rules requiring telecoms carriers to treat all types of traffic equally (known as \"network neutrality\") is counter-productive: it will give the carriers more control over the network and allow them to extract more rent. Instead, the Federal Communications Commission should expand such initiatives as the citizens broadband radio service, which allows more sharing of radio spectrum.</p><p>Some of this may sound like small beer, but the history of information technology shows that small tweaks have often been -effective in bringing down the -giants. Moreover, the mix of technology and regulation will have to be adjusted and readjusted over time.</p><p>\"There won't be a great moment, one great battle which you win,\" says Benkler. It sounds Sisyphean, but the alternative would be even more painful. Decentralisation is ultimately a question of democracy. As digital technology penetrates society ever more deeply and the two become ever more intertwined, the rules of the former increasingly will govern the latter. And the more the internet, along with its applications and everything that is attached to it, is controlled by tech titans (or indeed by the government, as in China), the less free it is likely to be.As John Sherman, the senator who gave his name to the US's original antitrust law in 1890, put it when the robber barons ruled much of America's economy: \"If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-da45950c7ce611e89055d9327f71f1866a60d22054445965efffafb11f7b9359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SPG-2P91-F0JP-W0WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The new rules will cover media giants such as Facebook, search engines like Google, interactive games such as Fortnite and messaging apps and online forums such as Snapchat and TripAdvisor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A White Paper, published today, says any tech company that allows the sharing of content or user interaction will be bound by the duty of care and face draconian sanctions if they breach it. The sanctions range from fines based on the company's size, to criminal prosecutions of directors, removal of their sites from search engines and a block on access to users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The regulator The duty of care, which requires firms to take \"all reasonable steps\" to keep users safe and tackle illegal and harmful content, will be policed by an independent regulator.</p><p>The regulator will be funded by the tech industry in the medium term, with the prospect of a levy on firms to ensure long-term sustainability.</p><p>The regulator will be able to demand information from the companies, including details of controversial algorithms that have been blamed for driving content to users, as is thought to have happened with Molly Russell, 14, who took her own life after viewing self-harm material on Instagram.</p><p>It will also draw up legally enforced codes of practice spelling out what tech companies must do to protect users from harms such as terrorist content, child sexual abuse, illegal drugs or weapons sales, cyber bullying, self-harm, harassment, disinformation, violence and pornography.</p><p>Enforcement The regulator will serve notices on errant firms to force them to put right breaches. It will also have \"name and shame\" powers, requiring companies to publish public notices on their sites about how they have failed to comply with standards. Every company will have to produce annual reports for the regulator on the scale of harms and what they are doing to combat them.</p><p>The fines are expected to mirror those for data protection laws, which are up to 4 per cent of global turnover. Ministers are consulting on additional powers, including disrupting businesses by removing them from search results, app stores and links.</p><p>There could be civil or criminal liability for breaches on senior staff and, as a last resort, the power to require Internet Service Providers to block firms' access to UK users.</p><p>Codes of Practice Each code, covering three areas of concern, says the firms' platforms need to be \"safe by design\", explaining clearly to users what is harmful content, how they can complain, response times and what action they can take, such as blocking, muting or staying hidden from other users.</p><p>1. Terror and child abuse: The regulator will decide the time frame within which platforms should remove content, such as the live-streamed New Zealand mosque massacre, and require them to identify and act on paedophiles' grooming of children. NSPCC statistics show there were 5,161 offences of grooming children online in 18 months. Breck Bednar, 14, was murdered after being groomed by a man he met via an online forum.</p><p>The two codes - which have to be signed off by the Home Secretary - will require tech firms to develop technology to stop terrorist or child abuse content getting online, and to prevent potential extremists or paedophiles from searching their sites.</p><p>Although Facebook says it took down 14 million pieces of terrorist content last year, the Government says the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant used more than 100 platforms to spread terrorist propaganda.</p><p>2. Disinformation: Firms will be required to have dedicated factchecking, especially during elections, to promote authoritative news sources. Platforms will be required to ensure their algorithms do not drive \"extreme and unreliable\" information to users to keep them online, which boosts advertising revenues.</p><p>3. Self-harm and suicide: Algorithms that promote self-harm or suicide to users will be banned, while firms will have to remove \"illegal\" or \"unacceptable\" content \"rapidly\". Other harms include hate crime, harassment and serious violence.</p><p>Age verification Tech firms will be under a legal duty to protect children from inappropriate content and to enforce their terms and conditions, which set out age limits. This means they could face sanctions if they lack robust age verification. With up to 40 per cent of under-13s on social media, it will mean millions of children being removed or barred.</p><p>Platforms may have to impose different settings for children and filters to block inappropriate content.</p><p>Complaints Users will have a legal right to an \"effective and easy-to-access\" complaints function with a set timescale for responses and an internal appeals system. It will be backed by either an independent redress or super-complaints system.</p><p>'I believe we need a more active role for governments' What the social media bosses have said about increasing regulation Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, has recently made an open plea for more regulation of social media and tech companies.</p><p>Writing in The Washington Post, he said he would like to see governments set clearer rules for how tech companies should deal with harmful content, election interference, privacy and data portability.</p><p>He said: \"I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators.\"</p><p>His comments come after his company has been hit by a series of data and misinformation scandals.</p><p>Google/YouTube</p><p>Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, which owns YouTube, has been more circumspect when it comes to the prospect of greater regulation of big tech firms.</p><p>He has said that he supports federal privacy legislation in the US, telling a congressional hearing: \"Protecting the privacy and security of our users has long been an essential part of our mission.\"</p><p>He has defended the company against accusations of political bias in search results. He said: \"I lead ... without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way.\"</p><p>Instagram</p><p>Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook-owned Instagram, is the only leader of a tech giant to back the idea of a duty of care. He told The Daily Telegraph in February that \"we have room to improve and we have a responsibility to improve\", after the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.</p><p>Her father, Ian, accused Instagram of \"helping to kill\" his daughter after he discovered she had viewed self-harm and suicide material on the site before taking her life in 2017. Mr Mosseri said he was personally moved to change policies after hearing Molly's story.</p><p>Twitter</p><p>Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, has also backed calls for more regulation, describing new EU laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation as a \"netpositive\".</p><p>Mr Dorsey told Bloomberg this month that \"it adds a lot more clarity around privacy\".</p><p>He said he saw the job of regulators as firstly to \"protect the individual\". However, the 42-yearold added that he saw his company as \"an educator, helping regulators and legislators understand what's happening with technology\".</p><p>Snapchat</p><p>Evan Spiegel, the CEO of the ephemeral messaging app, has also spoken positively about regulating tech giants.</p><p>He recently said he was \"really impressed\" with Europe's efforts to bring in online laws, which he lauded as \"really putting consumers first\". Mr Spiegel also said at a summit last month that the less regulated US had room to \"course-correct\".</p><p>The 28-year-old added: \"The more that companies can align with the government to do what's right for customers, I think everyone will win there.\"</p><p>Road to victory</p><p>Campaign won support from experts, charities and ministers June 2018 The Telegraph launches the campaign with a raft of experts and charities backing a statutory responsibility for tech companies to protect children, a concept with a long history in British law.</p><p>Force social media firms to protect children Duty of care</p><p>TELEGRAPH CAMPAIGN 15-year-old boy from north London being admitted to hospital for eight weeks after becoming addicted to online gaming, and Felix Alexander, from Worcester, who took his own life, aged 17, after being relentlessly bullied online.</p><p>The growing concern comes as an investigation by The Telegraph found: Almost a quarter of UK schoolchildren now spend more than six hours a day online outside school hours, with 4 per cent at risk of a clinical definition of addiction - four times the proportion of alcoholics in the population; f By Charles Hymas, Anna Mikhailova and Paul Nuki SOCIAL media and online gaming firms should have a statutory \"duty of care\" to protect children from mental ill health, abuse and addictive behaviour, a coalition of the country's leading experts demands today.</p><p>September 2018 Our investigation finds that Instagram's algorithm was promoting more self-harm content to young people who had already liked such images, prompting condemnation from children's charities.

She had no particular interest in this internet thing. But she liked the idea of learning something new, so she went along. She and a handful of women from nearby villages were all given a smartphone and some basic lessons in how to use it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"First we had to learn how to turn it on and off,\" says Santosh Sharma (no relation), a 24-year-old schoolteacher from the neighbouring village. Once they had mastered that, they got down to the essentials: \"How to take a selfie, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, how to search.\" </p><p>That was in September 2016, when nobody in the villages had a phone. \"Now everybody has one,\" says Ms Sharma of Madhogarh. \"You see old people walking around watching 'Mahabharat',\" a television series based on a Hindu mythological epic. Down the road from her home three men sit in the shade of a rohida tree, playing a game of ludo on one of their phones. </p><p>According to India's telecoms regulator, subscriptions for mobile-broadband services more than doubled between the end of 2016 and the end of 2018, from 218m to 500m. At about 3,500 rupees ($50) for a low-end model, smartphones remain dear for an Indian villager's pocket. But, says Ms Sharma, \"everyone has been bitten by the bug; nobody cares how expensive it is.\" </p><p>For those who do care, at least a bit, a smartish phone from Reliance Jio\u2014one with app-running cleverness, but no touchscreen\u2014can be had for just 1,500 rupees. Jio, backed by the muscle of the Reliance group, has subsidised not just handsets but also, more importantly, data transmission. Competition between it and the incumbents has seen the price of a mobile-data package slashed by 94%, and consumption has duly exploded ten-fold to 8.8GB per subscriber per month. Indians now gobble up nearly three times as much data on their phones as Americans. They seem on course to become the world's biggest consumers of mobile-phone data.</p><p>The size and speed of India's growth spurt owes a lot to the price war Reliance Jio set off. But the global trend it embodies does not. At some time in 2018 the proportion of the global population using the internet rose above half, according to the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency. The second half of the internet will not come online as quickly as the first half was doing in the early 2010s; exponential growth cannot continue in a finite world. But if the 710m new internet users expected to come online in the next seven years is only half the number that arrived in the past seven years, it is still a mighty throng. The chances that a child born today will not have a phone as a teenager are already slim, and quickly growing slimmer. </p><p>And almost all this future growth will be in developing countries. The 81% of the developed world\u2014a billion people\u2014online is unlikely to increase its number by much. China, at 58%\u2014800m people\u2014has more room for growth. But internet users elsewhere, who already handily outnumber those in the developed world and China put together, make up only 39% of their countries' populations. Those are the countries where most of the next billion will come from, and the billion after that, and the billion after that (see chart 1). And as they swell the internet's numbers, they will change its character. </p><p>The second half of the internet will for the most part speak languages other than English and Mandarin. It will have little to no experience with other digital media. It will also come online almost entirely on mobile devices. Hotstar, launched by Rupert Murdoch's Star India in 2015, became India's most popular streaming app because it foresaw that the second screen in Indian households would be a smartphone. Increasingly, the first screen will be, too. The idea of a big screen with a fixed connection will be as alien to the second half as landlines and cathode-ray tubes are to today's youngsters. </p><p>Better, cheaper hardware explains part of this. An entry-level smartphone today packs more power and features than the first iPhone in 2007, often at a tenth or less of the price. But poor people are not coming online because another core in the processor or megapixel in the camera matters to them. According to Ajit Mohan, Facebook's new India chief and the former boss of Hotstar, it is the services that drive demand: the consumers want messaging, video and storytelling, all of which the mobile internet is far better at providing than it was a decade ago.</p><p>People want to stay in touch with each other, to be entertained and to express themselves, whatever their income and wherever they call home. This is true in the rich word and in China. It will be true everywhere else, too. And the poorer people are, the more a phone outperforms all the other options they can afford as a way of fulfilling these needs. For many people the phone offers an unsurpassable opportunity for turning otherwise empty time into something enjoyable. According to Payal Arora, a professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the internet is the leisure economy of the world's poor.</p><p>Until recently, talk of connectivity in the poor world has almost invariably been clothed in the pragmatic and well-meaning language of development. Aid agencies, international bodies and big tech companies told themselves and their funders that poor people needed an internet connection to lift themselves out of misery. They extolled farmers looking up grain prices, women seeking information on maternal health or pupils diligently signing up for online courses. The website for Facebook's internet.org, an arm of the company focused on bringing unconnected people online, is a classic of the genre: \"Imagine the difference an accurate weather report could make for a farmer planting crops, or the power of an encyclopedia for a child without textbooks?The more we connect, the better it gets.\" In her book \"The Next Billion Users\", Ms Arora finds that Westerners assume that poverty \"is a compelling enough reason for the poor to choose work over play when they go online.\" </p><p>The poor do not see it that way. Years of fieldwork across the globe have led Ms Arora to conclude that when it comes to getting online, \"play dominates work, and leisure overtakes labour.\" Where people planning development strategies imagined, metaphorically at least, Blackberries providing new efficiencies and productivity, consumers wanted the chat, apps and games of the iPhone. Worthier uses tend to follow. But they are the cart not the horse.</p><p>The pattern has been repeated in country after country. When Brazil opened thousands of subsidised cybercaf\u00e9s in the late 2000s it brought internet access to 60% of poor neighbourhoods. The caf\u00e9s were a huge success\u2014because people used them to watch movies and play computer games. They liked to hang out with each other, too. Orkut, Google's first attempt at social networking, was a huge success in Brazil in the early 2010s; Brazilians are now the world's third-largest national population on Facebook, after India and the United States. According to Latinobarometro, a pollster, of the Latin Americans who eat only one meal a day, one out of three still contrives to use a smartphone. Juliano Spyer, an anthropologist who studies Brazilians' internet use, found that the reason poor people in the north-eastern state of Bahia pay for connectivity is that they see it as a form of social mobility\u2014not because they use it to earn more, but because they use it to be more connected.</p><p>In Angola, Wikipedia and Facebook \"zero-rate\" their services: people using the approved versions of their apps pay no network charges for data from them. They do not get all the internet's goodies\u2014but they get an internet that is deemed both good and good-enough. This resulted in users finding new ways to piggyback pirated movies on to the free services. A wide-ranging 2015 study of digital lifestyles by Caribou Digital, a consultancy, points to research from Zambia which shows that \"entertainment is the first thing that [users] demand, and then other things come around this.\" A survey of online activity in sub-Saharan Africa by Pew Research Center, a pollster, saw 85% of respondents saying they used the internet to stay in touch with friends and family. Only 17% said they used it to take classes. </p><p>Global as the trend is, though, India is the best place to observe it\u2014and perhaps profit from it. It has a relatively open market and a newbie population that is large, linguistically diverse and poor, which makes it a proxy for the second half worldwide. The extraordinary speed of its boom is forcing companies to come up with new products and services that fit what the second half wants at a breakneck pace. </p><p>Back in Madhogarh, Ms Sharma uses her phone to video-chat with her son in Jaipur, three or four hours away by bus. The younger Ms Sharma uses her phone mostly for WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, and for watching videos on YouTube and TikTok, a Chinese-owned social app that has been downloaded a billion times since its launch in 2017, largely by people outside the world's big cities. Her smartphone does allow her to look up coursework for the classes she teaches. But mostly, she says, \"it is a way to do timepass\", using the Indian-English word for killing time. </p><p>\"Timepass\" is the essence of the internet. The vast majority of the top 25 apps by revenue in both Google's and Apple's app stores are games (and both companies announced new paid gaming services this year). Tencent became one of China's internet giants because of games. Facebook grew into the world's sixth-most valuable company by giving people a place to \"do timepass\". YouTube is the gateway to several lifetimes' worth of timepass. The fastest-growing new apps of recent years have all been aimed at timepass: Fortnite, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat. TikTok, which consists of 15-second videos, is timepass in its essence, made by bored kids in mofussil towns who have found vast audiences by doing silly things. </p><p>Timepass is a pleasure to both rich and poor (see chart 2). But the business model it can support depends on which of those markets you are looking at. If the timepassers have sufficient money, you can sell their attention on to advertisers who want them to consume other goods, too. If the timepassers are poor, you need to get them to pay for what they are doing.</p><p>The most striking thing they are doing is watching videos\u2014which they are also making, in great abundance. In 2016 there were only 20 Indian YouTube channels with more than 1m subscribers. Today there are 600. This year T-Series, a Bollywood studio and record label, became the most subscribed channel on YouTube, dethroning PewDiePie, a Swedish entertainer who had topped the charts for several years. Perhaps even more surprising, one of YouTube's top 50 channels worldwide is largely in Bhojpuri, a language spoken only in some of India's least-developed states. Google reckons that three-quarters of all mobile traffic in India is video.</p><p>Video offers its users whatever their lives need. Ms Sharma of Madhogarh uses YouTube to look up recipes, among other things. Recipes were a selling point for the menfolk of the village. They were reluctant to allow their wives to have smartphones until they were told that it would help the women cook new dishes. The kitchen is not the only site of consumption. A lot of Indians use phones to look at pornography with a level of privacy not previously easy to come by. PornHub, a large website, says 90% of its traffic from India is on mobile, compared with 75% from America.</p><p>Though not all countries have data plans as cheap as India's, the trend to video is universal, says David Shapiro, the business head of Google's \"Next billion users\" unit. Where mobile broadband is pricey, people download videos on Wi-Fi connections to view offline later on. </p><p>It is not just that video is easily available on the internet. To many in the second half video more or less is the internet. Anecdotally, it seems that YouTube is a more common Indian home page than Google. It is used to search not just for entertainment but for everything else. Snigdha Poonam, a journalist, says that when she mentions a book she wrote a few years ago to people she is interviewing in rural India, it is on YouTube that they search for it. </p><p>The preference for video is partially explained by the fact that the next half of the internet speaks a very wide range of languages\u2014but may not read any. Video in another language works better than text; video is easier to post to your peers than writing is. And speech beats typing\u2014as can be seen from the use of WhatsApp to send voice messages rather than texts. Though usually associated with pricey first-world gadgets such as the Amazon Echo, voice-input systems have found enthusiasts in the poor world, too. New internet users in India routinely use voice commands to operate their phones, including for such tasks as making calls. When Gaana, a big Indian music-streaming app, underwent a recent redesign, its product managers made voice the primary way to search. \"I was very weirded out that they made voice search more prominent than text search,\" says Satyan Gajwani, the Silicon Valley-based boss of Times Internet, the part of the Times of India media conglomerate which owns Gaana. But \"voice search is now almost as big as non-voice search.\" </p><p>What works for leisure can also work for work. Mukesh, an illiterate cab driver in Mumbai, uses Uber's ride-hailing app through a combination of voice input and audio direction. When he has to send messages, he speaks into a voice-to-text app, copies what turns up on the screen onto a messaging app and sends it to his waiting passenger-to-be, hoping it makes sense. Mostly, it does. Low-income internet-users are not uninterested in its work-related possibilities. But these tend to be a later consideration, and one that is a bonus. </p><p>Ways of making money out of other people's internet use have not yet come to grips with the timepass of the almost entirely unwealthy. In the most recent full year, 46% of Google's revenues came from the United States and 6% from the rest of the Americas. Asia contributed 15%. A Facebook user in North America generates 12 times more in revenue than one in Asia, and most of today's Facebook users in Asia are better off than most of those who are on the way. But nearly 90% of Facebook's growth in the next four years is expected to come from South-East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. It is not just that these people will have less money with which to buy the things advertisers want to sell them. There are fewer things to advertise to them in the first place. Mr Shapiro at Google describes the question of how to be important to the second half as \"existential\" for his company. </p><p>Google, which owns the Android operating system used by 86% of the world's smartphones, is trying to shift its thinking to build products for Mumbai, not Mountain View. The workshops in Rajasthan were part of a Google initiative called \"internet saathi\", or \"internet buddy\", aimed at women. Mr Shapiro's unit sends teams to developing countries to better understand how people there use the internet, and what they might want from it next. </p><p>Learning that a third of Indian phone users wake up every day to an alert warning that their phones are running out of storage space, Google created an app, Files, that helps them clear out the junk. It proved a hit worldwide. A for-profit tie-up with Indian Railways to install Wi-Fi at stations has spread to six other countries.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>A Google paper on new product design notes that in poor countries \"engagement with the immediate environment through multiple senses (visual, aural, olfactory, and tactile) may be more pronounced.\" It advises product designers that \"Western aesthetics, such as minimal use of colour, sound, and text, and stylised visual elements often fade out in these environments.\"</p><p>Yet even a company with the financial and technological resources of Google may not always see all the angles that the new internet offers. Unlike iPhones, many Android devices have ports for external storage, such as memory cards. When it learned that many users were carrying lots of data on such cards, Google's solution was to produce Files to free up storage. That made people happier with their phones. </p><p>But Indians do not just use memory cards because their phones have run out of room. They get them loaded with pirated movies and music for a small fee at a local corner shop, often packaged with an app called MX Player. The app is installed on 1.2m Android phones every day, and two-thirds of those installs are sideloaded from memory cards, rather than downloaded from Google's Play store, which is the way most Western Android users get their apps.</p><p>To Times Internet, this looked like an opportunity to reach a new market. Last year it bought MX Player for $140m and built a movie- and music-streaming service into it with which it can now reach a great many people who it knows like cheap video. It was an opportunity others might not have seen. As Mr Gajwani says, the strategies for growth in non-metropolitan India are going to be very different from those applied in the cities, and they will be hard for firms based in Beijing or San Francisco\u2014or even the nicer bits of Mumbai\u2014to pull off. Price-sensitivity is only one element of it. Understanding the culture matters too.</p><p>Or consider Jio. Chris Lane of Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, estimates that Reliance, a conglomerate with fingers in everything from power generation to retailing, invested $37bn to get its network up and running. In so doing, it has built a user base which it hopes eventually to tap for more than just its current very low data charges. The mobile network has set up movie, music, television and sports streaming services; news and content aggregators; chat, cloud storage and payment services; its own app store; and an annual subscription service called Jio Prime. It aims to be the tollgate for all timepass. </p><p>It is not a unique strategy. As a report by the GSMA, a trade organisation for mobile network operators, recently argued, content is the \"natural next move for telecoms operators\" with pay-TV \"a clear opportunity\". What distinguishes Jio is that it has been able to spend tens of billions to build a network towards that end from scratch. Few enjoy that luxury. But some aspects of Jio's strategy\u2014a focus on network speed, an enticing introductory offer of free data, a level of infrastructure ownership\u2014can be drawn on by those with shallower pockets, says Mr Lane. </p><p>The other, crucial aspect of understanding the second half is that seemingly unlikely things can have value. When you call an Indian mobile phone, it is not uncommon to hear a song instead of the traditional ringing tone. That song, a \"caller ring back tone\" in the jargon, is chosen by the user you are calling, who pays for the privilege. Until the rise of smartphones and social networks, caller tunes were a big money-spinner for Indian mobile operators, contributing 82bn rupees in revenue in the three years to March 2012. All this for music only others would hear.</p><p>The urge driving people to pay a monthly fee for something they do not themselves consume is self-expression, which may be a key to coming up with new sustainable business models for the low-income internet. Times Internet is experimenting with \"themes\", where users pay a small fee to personalise the appearance of an app on their phone. Another idea is paying one rupee or so to include a personal message with a song before sharing it with a friend or loved one. Such business models will have to be based around tiny amounts of money on a massive scale.</p><p>Entertainment, communication and self-expression go hand in hand. Households in India and countries like it tend to have a single television shared by large families. The ability to consume media of your own choice is a step change from having to watch whatever granny had chosen. Daniel, a Ugandan who took part in Caribou's big survey, said: \"At home I have a lot of siblings, there is a TV set and a radio which is kept by an auntie. Whenever she is leaving she says, 'this radio is for Bujingo' [pastor]? so I wouldn't get time to listen to music because of the fights at home but now whenever I feel like listening to music, I control it.\"</p><p>Smartphones and social media are, for many in the second half, arenas with a semblance of privacy. While Western internet users fret about the privacy implications of big tech companies hoarding their data, young internet users in the towns and villages of the developing world are delighted to have, for the first time, a way to communicate and express themselves away from the prying eyes of family, neighbours and other busybodies. In Asia and the Middle East smartphones open up a world of romance, enabling people to flirt and date despite social constraints. All over, they allow people who may never travel abroad to make new friends around the world\u2014and people who are travelling, often as migrant workers, to stay in touch. </p><p>Providing access to entertainment, opportunities for a richer social life and the ability to speak and be heard to hundreds of millions will mark a profound improvement in humankind's aggregate quality of life. It will have risks, as the politicisation of social media and the social mediation of politics in rich countries have shown. But just as they will be facing some of the same risks, the world's rich and poor will be sharing experiences. They will be spending their time doing the same things: chatting on WhatsApp, liking pictures on Instagram, watching videos on YouTube, doing timepass on TikTok. The world's ability to have a little bit of chill time is becoming more equal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-JV80NB9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8S-H4H1-DY2R-2012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

How can I plan for an uncertain future? How much will the presidential election impact a recovery?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are some of the biggest questions that Matt Tipple - an executive director, market leader and client advisor at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in upstate New York - has been getting from clients recently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We talked to Tipple about how he's been answering those questions, and why he's optimistic for the rest of the year.</p><p>Have we gotten through the worst of this economic crisis? We're in the early cycle of a recovery, and do believe we've seen the worst of the economic recession. When you think about what happened, the government shut down the entire economy. At that time, we didn't have a good handle on the health care side of it, so in doing their job they did shut down the economy for the health and safety of everybody. They took a lot of comprehensive, quick fiscal measures to keep everyone afloat and some of the insurance programs they improved as well.</p><p>If you look at credit card data and spending from the beginning of the year through March, it is amazing to think credit card spending is only 10% below where it was at the beginning of the year even with less tourism. If you put all of that together, we are confident we're in the beginning of a recovery. People are getting back to work a little bit and people are still working from home, but working to get kids back to school. It's starting to be reflected in the economic data.</p><p>We think fiscal policy has done a nice job. It's been an impressive effort to do that for businesses. Our portfolios we're managing are more defensive today and we're looking at some trends we can invest in for the future today: technology, innovation and sustainability.</p><p>How quick will the recovery be? It's not going to be the easiest recovery. We have a lot of unemployment and headwinds. New York is no longer, fortunately, a peak state, but we're still seeing other states with growing cases that have reopened. It could provide a headwind for the overall economy. We think with better treatment, PPE and better awareness of the problem there's going to be a high hurdle before people shut down economies again. I think, and the J.P. Morgan view, is we're in the early stages of an economic recovery and will hopefully be quicker than the last recession.</p><p>Will the presidential election impact a recovery? Everyone wants to know about the election and how that should be a concern for clients. Regardless of whether it is a Republican or Democrat in the office of the president, there is economic growth and innovation charges forward. Still optimistic regardless of what happens. And there is a lot of overlap, whether Democrat or Republican, in deficit spending, big tech regulations, China policy, but clearly a difference in tax policy.</p><p>Corporate taxes could increase with a blue wave, and clients are preparing for that and investing appropriately. By and large, it was a very stressful first half of they year, but I think generally clients are feeling optimistic and confident they'll be okay through the other side of this.</p><p>This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Over the three years or so Mr. Mzengeza has held the stock in the CIBC Global Technology fund, the company has gone from a peripheral e-commerce startup to one of the country's largest public companies, with the share price rising nearly tenfold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it's still early days for Shopify, Mr. Mzengeza said, suggesting he expects the holding to continue driving excess returns.</p><p>The CIBC Global Technology fund was recently recognized for industry-best performance by the Lipper Fund Awards, which ranks Canadian portfolio managers across several different categories.</p><p>In the global equity category, the CIBC fund's average annual return of 19.8 per cent over the past three years outperformed all peers. Mr. Mzengeza spoke to The Globe and Mail about how he goes about beating the market.</p><p>What is your approach with this fund?</p><p>We try to invest early in the lifecycle of secular themes. Right now we're looking at 5G, AI, machine learning, cloud, payments and e-commerce. And we try to find those names which are not as well followed.</p><p>Do you avoid the FAANG stocks?</p><p>We're staying away from Facebook and Alphabet, not just because of valuation, but because of regulatory risk around the business model.</p><p>Are you worried about another tech stock bubble?</p><p>The fundamental strength of these businesses is better than the last time around. They generate free cash flow, they generate profit, they're continuously growing. Valuations may be stretched, so we have allocated more towards health care, where there is more of a value tilt. And we've raised some cash that we can deploy if there is a sell-off.</p><p>Is Shopify's valuation stretched?</p><p>Right now, $183-billion of commerce goes through the Shopify platform. And their revenue is only $1.6-billion. Can they take a bigger share of that revenue base? I believe that they can. We're still at the very early stages of e-commerce penetration. As a good analogy, if you put $1,000 in Amazon when it IPO'd 25 years ago, that would be worth more than $1-million.</p><p>Amazon went public early on in its evolution. With startups staying private for longer, is it more challenging to tap into the earlier stages of a company's growth?</p><p>That has made it challenging. Some of the companies we would have wanted to invest in at an earlier stage, like Uber or Lyft, we haven't been able to do that. But we're still seeing plenty of early-stage companies. We've participated in a few IPOs this year, including Zoom Video Communications and PagerDuty. Both of those performed pretty well out of the gate. And we sold out when valuations became a bit stretched.</p><p>Any other Canadian names in the fund besides Shopify?</p><p>You have better opportunities outside Canada. If you're looking for a leading company within a sector, I struggle to find any other companies within Canada beyond Shopify.</p><p>The fund seems to have a heavy weighting in payment technology.</p><p>Fiserv and Global Payments are unique opportunities because of the fact that the payment industry is going through consolidation. Fiserv bought First Data and Global Payments bought TSYS and we think there's an opportunity for outsized synergies from both those acquisitions. As for Mastercard, we own it because of the fact they're moving from from cash and cheques to digital payments. And Mastercard has done a good job of outgrowing Visa.</p><p>How are you navigating the AI space?</p><p>We're in the phase when people are building up the infrastructure that's going to enable AI. If you think about this as a gold rush, we want to be with the people who are supplying the picks and axes and not the people who are actually getting the gold out of the ground. Our main investment in AI is Nvidia, which makes their GPUs available for AI and machine learning, and they're a leader in that segment.</p><p>Any other big tech themes you like right now?</p><p>We have a position in IAC, which owns about 80 per cent of Match. It's going to spin out that investment. And we think Match as an asset is undervalued. It owns the likes of Tinder, Hinge and a lot of other online dating websites. Another one is gaming. We hold Activision Blizzard, which owns the Overwatch League. Our other big investment in the space is Tencent, which is one of the biggest video game developers in the world. They own League of Legends and they own part of Epic Games, which owns Fortnite. The younger generation is more interested in spending their downtime playing video games, but also interacting with their friends through that medium.</p><p>Click <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-the-2019-lipper-fund-award-mutual-fund-and-etf-winners/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-the-2019-lipper-fund-award-mutual-fund-and-etf-winners/</url> for the top Canadian funds and ETFs for 2019 as chosen by Lipper</p><p>Click <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-the-2019-lipper-fund-award-top-mutual-fund-and-etf-group-winners-for/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-the-2019-lipper-fund-award-top-mutual-fund-and-etf-group-winners-for/</url> for the top fund and ETF groups for 2019.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cibc-global-technology-fund-manager-discusses-his-vision-for-beating/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cibc-global-technology-fund-manager-discusses-his-vision-for-beating/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20191105ellipsis_BBVYU7H56VA2PNNJ3K26SOUEQM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH9-26G1-F072-J4X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>10:54 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But given that Nadler and other members of Congress are a bit busy with other proceedings these days, it may be left to New York Attorney General Letitia James to get the job done. That job \u2013 addressing whether tech behemoths have grown too big for our own good \u2013 is of course not something James can get done on her own, which is why large coalitions of attorneys general have formed to investigate companies including Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We do have a renewed focus on mergers and anticompetitiveness, not only in the tech industry but in other industries as well,\" James said in June at a press conference announcing a lawsuit to block a merger between telecommunications companies T-Mobile and Sprint over concerns that the union will hurt competition in the industry. \"We're going to take a critical eye on a number of mergers going forward.\"</p><p> Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School and author of the book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\" said that state attorneys' general focus on antitrust issues is not something that was born with the advent of Big Tech, but reaches back to cases like Standard Oil. But on issues like the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, Wu said, state-level action comes in part from the severity of the cases and a federal dereliction of duty. And while the federal government has been more active on Big Tech issues, he said, there is some uncertainty about where President Donald Trump stands on antitrust questions in cases like Google or Facebook. \"The Trump administration has a history of looking for quid pro quos,\" he said. \"I think states feel like they're the backup.\"</p><p> Wu, who worked under former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as senior enforcement counsel, credited both James and staff \u2013 like antitrust bureau head Beau Buffier \u2013 with leading on antitrust issues. \"I worked in those offices, and if the person at the top is not into this stuff, it doesn't happen,\" Wu said of James. He also noted that James and her staff have been successful in leading large bipartisan coalitions like the one probing Facebook.</p><p> While antitrust may continue to be a focus for James in the long run, the office may have its plate full now, Wu said. \"They're hunting elephants. If you have two elephants charging at you, adding a third or fourth is at some point going to strain the resources there,\" he said, mentioning James leading the actions against Facebook and T-Mobile/Sprint in particular. \"I gotta give the New York AG's office (credit),\" Wu added. \"They are bringing back the tradition of the trust buster, of sort of the fearless public servants who ride into the battle despite the great dangers, even to their careers.\"</p><p> City &amp; State rounded up the details on these antitrust actions as well as some of the other ways James has managed to crack down on issues like data privacy and questions about emerging technologies like cryptocurrency.</p><p> Antitrust</p><p>T-Mobile/Sprint \u2013 A controversial merger between two of the country's largest telecom companies (T-Mobile and Sprint) has gotten nearly all the way through a demanding gauntlet of obstacles, such as Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department approval processes. Now, only one real obstacle remains, and that's James and a cadre of other state attorneys general. Following a 2018 investigation into the merger by former New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, James is now co-leading a lawsuit with California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, on the grounds that the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint \u2013 the third and fourth largest telecom companies in the nation \u2013 would hurt competition and raise prices, among other concerns. But in recent weeks, a few states have dropped out of the coalition after reaching settlements with T-Mobile, including Texas and Colorado.</p><p>Facebook \u2013 Facebook, the subject of much Big Tech criticism, is now facing an investigation led by James for possible antitrust violations. A total of 47 attorneys general have joined that probe, which will reportedly look into whether the social media giant broke any state or federal laws as a result of anti-competitive conduct, as well as how the company handles user data. Since its founding, Facebook has acquired other social media and messaging companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Google \u2013 James is also participating in a separate antitrust probe, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and featuring a total of 50 attorneys general. This probe, not unlike the Facebook investigation, is set to concentrate on Google's dominance of the online advertising market. The investigation, may however, be expanded to include scrutiny of whether the company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct in relation to its search and Android software business.</p><p> Data privacy</p><p>Equifax Inc. \u2013 Equifax's 2017 data breach exposed the personal information of more than half of the U.S. population, and a coalition of 50 attorneys general weren't going to let the consumer credit reporting agency get off scot-free. James co-led the coalition and in July announced a $600 million settlement with the company, including a payment of more than $9 million to New York alone, for the more than 8.5 million residents whose personal information had been illegally accessed.</p><p>Google/YouTube \u2013 The antitrust probe isn't James' first time taking on Google. The attorney general investigated Google and YouTube and concluded that the two companies violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by tracking and targeting advertisements to users who had watched YouTube videos directed to children under the age of 13. In September, the Federal Trade Commission and the attorney general's office fined Google and YouTube a combined $170 million, with $34 million going directly to New York, marking the largest settlement from COPPA enforcement ever.</p><p>Online Buddies, Inc. \u2013 Smaller tech companies are not immune from James' scrutiny. Online Buddies, Inc., which operates that LGBTQ-targeted dating app \"Jack'd,\" agreed to pay $240,000 in a settlement with the attorney general's office for failing to secure its users' private and nude photos. The settlement also included requirements for the company to implement a \"comprehensive security program.\"</p><p> And more</p><p>Cardis Enterprises International \u2013 Bringing down the now-defunct Nassau County-based tech startup Cardis Enterprises International was another tag-team effort between James and her predecessor, Underwood. Last year, Underwood brought a suit against Cardis for allegedly taking more than $30 million from investors under the false claim that its patented technology would reduce the cost of credit card transactions for businesses. This October, James secured default judgments against the company.</p><p>iFinex \u2013 Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are perhaps one of the emerging technologies that pose the most regulatory questions, but James has leveled rather straightforward allegations of fraud against iFinex Inc., which operates the virtual asset trading platform Bitfinex and the tether virtual currency Tether Limited. In April, James announced that her office obtained a court order against iFinex demanding the company cease further dissipation of dollars backing the tether coin, after her office determined that iFinex dealt with an undisclosed loss of $850 million by giving Bitfinex access to up to $900 million of Tether's cash reserves to hide the loss. iFinex, meanwhile, has denied the findings.</p><p> WeWork \u2013 James is reportedly investigating New York's most newsworthy startup that is arguably not really a tech company: WeWork. The attorney general's office said it has yet to confirm or deny the Reuters report that James is looking into the struggling company's issues, including whether founder and former CEO Adam Neumann engaged in self-dealing to enrich himself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tish James and her staff have been successful in leading large bipartisan coalitions like the one probing Facebook.

A handful of dominant companies \u2014 Verizon and AT...t the top and Sprint and T-Mobile at the bottom \u2014 locked users in two-year contracts, and used added fees and features to expand their networks and satisfy investors, if not consumers. But after regulators stopped AT...rom buying T-Mobile, the carrier named John Legere chief executive, and he rebranded the company the 'Uncarrier.'&lt;nl/&gt; T-Mobile began making consumer-friendly moves, with reduced prices and plans that were easier to understand. Verizon and AT...ollowed suit, offering more data\u00a0at the same prices and introducing contract-free plans. T-Mobile began offering unlimited data, and improving the quality of of service on its network. T-Mobile and Verizon recently tied for the fastest LTE data speeds. Sprint has begun\u00a0offering competitive plans.&lt;nl/&gt; Kelleher reports that while consumers used to have little choice, they're now routinely searching for the best-priced plans from the four major carriers. The change has had a marked impact on carriers' bottom line, too.\u00a0AT... gross margins have been declining, and Verizon warned that its earnings will be flat next year.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Carriers have a new form of competition to deal with in the form of the iPhone Upgrade Program that Apple introduced with the iPhone 6s. The program will enable iPhone fans to get a new iPhone each year by paying as little as $32 each month and choosing any of the major carriers for their service. The plan makes it easier for consumers to switch carriers, and harder for carriers to attract customers to more costly plans.&lt;nl/&gt; It took some time, but Apple's announcement kicked off a new rivalry between carriers. While Verizon and AT...nnounced that they didn't see the plan as a threat, and didn't plan to change their policies in response, T-Mobile began offering discounted leases on the iPhone 6s, which customers could get for as little as $5 per month. Sprint responded with an offer that lets customers lease an iPhone 6s for as little as $1 per month, revealing that both carriers are willing to eat costs in the short term to gain customers long-term.&lt;nl/&gt; Kelleher reports that analysts think the aggressive iPhone leasing program will not only help T-Mobile gain market share, but could also increase its profit margins. As subscribers increasingly take advantage of the array of options to choose carriers that enable them to upgrade more often, leasing could improve profits. And some analysts even think that AT... and Verizon's decisions to stay out of the aggressive leasing rivalry between T-Mobile and Sprint could hurt those carriers, even though they currently dominate the United States' smartphone market.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;That possibility is already evident in the financial performance of the four major carriers in the U.S. Already, T-Mobile's Uncarrier campaign has been effective, as illustrated by the stock prices of the four major U.S. carriers. T-Mobile's stock is up 58% so far this year and Sprint's is up 6% while Verizon's is down 6% and AT... is down 4%.&lt;nl/&gt; A major unknown\u00a0that could affect carriers' financial performance\u00a0\u2014 and T-Mobile's ability to disrupt the industry in the future \u2014 is what will happen if landline companies merge with mobile carriers, as is currently expected. If Dish or Comcast, for instance, were to merge with T-Mobile, it's not clear if the carrier would be able to continue offering heavy discounts in order to attract customers. If that were the case, other mobile carriers could have less of an incentive to compete aggressively on price and quality of service \u2014 which could undo the progress that T-Mobile's made with its unconventional Uncarrier campaign.&lt;nl/&gt;More from Gear ...yle Cheat Sheet:&lt;nl/&gt;Why Big Tech Companies Want to Give Everyone the Internet[3] iPhone 6s: How to Get the Best Deal From Sprint or T-Mobile[4] Why Apple's New iPhones Are Not 'Secretly Waterproof'[5]&lt;nl/&gt; Want more great content like this?\u00a0Sign up here[6]\u00a0to receive the best of Cheat Sheet delivered daily.

Not everyone agreed (indeed, many people have disagreed). Many of those who disagreed, though, seemed to only do so because they hate the big internet companies, and thus they seemed happy about any attack on them, no matter how pointless. Others attacked me personally, insisting that my detailed explanation of why I found Warren's plan laughably naive was really just because I \"love big tech.\" Finally, some demanded to know what my plan would be. </p><p>And while I think it's somewhat silly to imply that you cannot critique a bad plan if you can't come up with another plan (sometimes, doing nothing is the best plan), I've been meaning to write some more about this anyway, and here's a good opportunity. Contrary to the strawman beliefs some insist I have, I am quite worried about the market power of many large companies these days, and how that might be stifling competition. As I've argued for over twenty years on this site, the single biggest driver of innovation is competition. And I want to see more competition to get more innovation. My issue is that doing so through regulatory means is fraught with significant risks -- ones that could very much do the opposite. Highly regulated industries are not known for being competitive and innovative for the most part. They tend to enable only big entities -- who can deal with the regulations -- to exist and crowd out startups. On top of that, thanks to regulatory capture and the crony nature of our political system these days, you also end up with just a few big companies who now focus on what we've referred to in the past as political innovation rather than technological or entrepreneurial innovation. It's a recipe for stagnation, not innovation and competition. My second big concern with the plans people have been floating is that they ignore the reality of why some of the tech companies have gotten so big and so successful. For the most part, they're in highly networked industries, where it's not just \"winner takes all\" but in many ways size and dominance of the network is fundamental to their operation. Network effects can lead to dominant positions, for the fairly obvious reason that the bigger they are, the better they are for everyone involved. For all of Warren's talk of breaking up companies, note that she was only talking about chipping off a few of their peripheral acquisitions: not taking an axe to their core business. And that's because she recognizes that as much as people scream to \"break up big tech,\" there's no reasonable way to do that without making the overall offerings a lot less useful for the public. How do you break up Facebook's social network? Do you say half the world can't use it and have to use the BookFace spinoff instead? You could, of course, cleave off Instagram and Whatsapp, but that doesn't really change Facebook's overall global dominance. The reason Facebook is so powerful is that it connects the entire globe. There is no place to make a reasonable cut to split that up. Google is powerful because of its search engine. How do you break that up? Do you say for searches on topic X you use Google, but for searches on topic Y you have to use Elgoog? You could cut off Doubleclick from Google, but then you still have a massive search engine and a massive internet ads company. And while I guess you could cut off Amazon's web services piece from it store, that doesn't change the main \"competition\" complaint most people have about Amazon, which is the size of its footprint in e-commerce. But again, it got there not through predatory practices, but because it's so convenient and easy for most people that they actually get tremendous benefit from it. But, that presents a dilemma. And while lots of people seem to think there are easy answers to this (just like they think there are easy answers to \"content moderation\") there are not. This is a really complex issue, and like nearly all super complex issues, the easy solutions tend to look appealing, while actually making everything a hell of a lot worse. So I will make a suggestion for how I'd like to \"break up\" big tech, while admitting that since this is a complex topic with no easy answer, I could be wrong. But so could everyone else. And I've been digging through the details on this stuff for many years now, and I do think my plan makes the most sense. Later this year, I have a big academic paper on this topic coming out with a lot more details, so in the meantime expect a bunch more posts on this topic leading up to that. The idea goes back to one I raised back in 2015 in the context of content moderation: that we need to move to a world of protocols, not platforms[3]. This is the world of the earlier internet, dominated by open protocols with a variety of competitive apps built on top. Instead of Twitter, there was IRC. Instead of Reddit, there was Usenet. And you had a choice of clients and servers and could move around if you didn't like the policies of one or the other. In the world of protocols, you still get the global connectivity benefit, but without the lockdown control and silos (and, potentially, the questionable privacy practices). In a world of protocols, there may be a global network, but you get competition at every other level. You can have competitive servers, competitive apps and user interfaces, competitive filters, competitive business models, and competitive forms of data management. If you don't like how one app provider handles privacy, you move to another -- but because you're using the same protocol, you don't lose everything you're doing with it, you're just entering through a new door that you like better. If you don't like the way one provider handles content moderation, you change it or move to another. And, yes, I noted competition at the business model level as well -- because that's important. We could see lots of interesting attempts at creating different services with different business models that go beyond the limited options (pay with your data, freemium, advertising, etc.) today. One option might be in the form of cryptocurrency or token tied to the protocol. While I can already hear half of you rolling your eyes, this is a model that is at least worth exploring. A cryptocurreny or token tied to a protocol takes away much of the incentive for the really terrible business models everyone complains about. You don't need to spy on everyone if just getting more usage in general increases the value of the currency. And encouraging business models that don't require collecting data on everyone is something we should celebrate, not mock. But, cryptocurrency isn't the only such solution either. I've been playing around with a few attempts at new protocol-based systems these days that purposely eschew the cryptocurrency/token model, and are exploring other models instead. The point is that there are other ways of making this work, and more options is better. However, if we were in a world where the major services and functions we used online were protocols instead of platforms, it would move the power and control out to the ends of the network, rather than centralizing it on the servers of a few giant companies. We'd still get the benefits of the network effects of the systems, but without the centralized control. We'd still be able to get innovation at various levels, but without relying on a single entity to determine what's best. We'd still get the convenience of powerful services, but without the opaque decision making of a single entity. It's an approach that could actually work. That still leaves the question of how do we get there from here. And there are a lot of challenges in that. But I don't think declaring large platforms as \"platform utilities\" gets us any closer to that vision -- and if anything seems to drive us away from it. I'll be writing some more posts on how we get towards a world of protocols instead of platforms, and the many hurdles in the way, in the coming weeks and months. However, there are two key approaches to making it happen: either bottom up or top down. And both could work -- but both could be difficult. The bottom up approach is people designing new protocols from scratch and building a new userbase. That presents a huge number of challenges in terms of building up the userbase, but it's not impossible. New startups pop on the scene all the time, and some of them even succeed. And I already know of at least 6 or 7 attempts at building these kinds of protocols from scratch. And while they're all fairly small, some are building up at least some traction and are interesting to follow and experiment with. The benefit to this approach is you have no legacy to deal with, making things easier to design and the entire setup more nimble. The cons, obviously, are the lack of a userbase and the basic \"empty room\" problem: how do you get someone to use a social application when there's nothing to do there and no one to connect with? The \"top down\" approach would be to convince an existing internet giant to move towards such a world. It's unlikely that any company today would agree to flip the switch entirely and open up their platform into an open protocol. But I would argue that it's not as far out and unrealistic an idea as many assume. In the last six months, I've had in-depth conversations with four large internet companies about this approach, and they were surprisingly more open to at least considering what it would mean than I initially expected. And while I may go into more detail in later posts, I'll give three quick reasons why the big tech firms may actually decide it makes sense to give up their silos in the long run:  It gets them away from proposals like Warren's to \"break up\" their business, which they know would create a giant mess. By opening up their core code for anyone to use and pushing the power out to the ends of the network, the companies are effectively \"breaking themselves up. It takes them off the hook for all of the platform liability that is getting dumped on them these days. There are all sorts of competing and impossible demands on these platforms concerning how they moderate content, with tons of people being upset no matter what decision is made, and various people and (especially) politicians now looking to dump massive liability on the platforms themselves. If they turn their system into a protocol, they actually get rid of much of that headache. There will still be questions about content moderation, but it becomes a very different problem -- one to where there can be many different approaches, with competition at the filter level. We didn't used to blame email providers for spam, but thanks to the open protocols of email, it allowed all sorts of innovative spam filtering services to spring up. Given how much of a headache content moderation and platform liability has become of late -- and the fact it's likely to become an even bigger headache over time -- at some point, companies are going to realize an open protocols approach is a solution to that problem. The possibility of new business models. This is important. Lots of people insist that no giant platform would willingly give up so much control, because it's entirely antithetical to business models built off of collecting all the data. And that's true. But, that's why I'm eager to see how new business models shake out in this space, because it might lessen the \"we collect all your data\" business model reliance and open up new opportunities that could even be more lucrative (especially if they create opportunities where people start abandoning services that don't respect their privacy).There still are plenty of reasons why the big platforms are unlikely to do this in the near future (and I'm pretty sure a clueless Wall St. would punish any company that tried), but as various trends continue to move along, it may become more and more appealing.Notice that all of that could very well happen without a massive policy intervention from the government. However, there are certainly policy ideas that could help move this along a lot faster. Of course, moving these policy proposals forward would require a more detailed understanding of how technology and technology innovation really works, because the key isn't enforcing breakups or trying to codify \"fairness\" guidelines with new rules -- it's taking away some of the existing legal and regulatory tools that make it easy and appealing to build vertically-integrated walled gardens, which aren't always obvious to people who aren't immersed in the tech policy space since they are presented as having other purposes: Get rid of most patents (if we're talking real antitrust, we'd start by getting rid of these government-granted monopolies). Perhaps you could start with \"software\" ones, though defining what is a \"software\" patent is hard enough. Patents hinder competition and would create huge problematic thickets in a world of protocols where we want widespread competition at every other level. Without patent thickets and patent trolls, we'd see a lot more competition, especially in taking different approaches to providing interfaces and filters for the same kinds of content. Dump the ridiculous CAFC ruling on API copyrights and make it clear that there is not copyright on interfaces, meaning that you could actually have much more interoperability and people building new systems to connect to third party products. Get rid of Section 1201 of the DMCA and its anti-circumvention rules. Again, this blocks competition and interoperability. Indeed, Section 1201 is a huge barrier to this kind of future, in that it would allow companies to effectively block out competitive third party services through \"technological protection measures.\" Without 1201, it would make it much easier for almost anyone to create a new competitive interface for an existing protocol-based service. Make sure that full encryption is supported as a fundamental right of end users. This becomes important, as a protocol-based system should also lead to a booming new market for databanks that will store your encrypted data, giving you total control over it and who it is shared with (and for what purposes). But if there are mandated backdoors or some other crap, you completely destroy such a market. Encryption makes this possible. Get the SEC to stop thinking of cryptocurrency as just a financial tool and to recognize it's something entirely different. Sure, you need them to deal with the out-and-out scams, but as it stands right now, the SEC is talking about crazy ideas like how any crypto system should need to go through \"clinical trials\" like drugs. Ideas like that would simply snuff out any possibility of the above ever happening. People don't realize how much of this future may be held back by a myopic SEC who is viewing all of this through a single lens.There's more, but those steps would open up a lot of opportunity for a protocols-based system to take hold. And when it really happens, no one's going to worry about \"breaking up\" big tech anymore, because it won't even be necessary.

Businesses and governments need to heighten their awareness of the possibility\u2014an overwhelming probability, I would need\u2014to accelerate four secular advances that influence what business and political leaders do and how they do what they do . Decision makers should think of these trends as waves that, especially if they occur simultaneously, could be perceived as a tsunami by those who do not adapt their thoughts and practices in a timely manner.</p><p><br/>The first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from being a relatively distant concern\u2014with sufficient time to take corrective action\u2014to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat.<br/>The mobilization of various segments of society, partly due to the unusual climatic disturbances of recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies that they must act now. BP's recent announcement of its intention to achieve \"net zero carbon emissions\" in 2050 \u2013 which is instituted as a remarkable promise by an energy company operating in several very difficult environments \u2013 is the latest example of how companies respond to such demands. It is only a matter of time before this pressure also calls on governments to take additional measures, not only to encourage green activities, but also to impose taxes and regulate pollution-causing activities.<br/>Second, privacy concerns have grown along side with technical innovations related to artificial intelligence and macro data or also called big data.<br/>The growing awareness of recent technological advances by society allows not only a more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data, but also the use of this information to control and alter Behaviors. Generally speaking, data is controlled and exploited either by governments (especially in China), by big tech companies (as is the case in the United States), or by users (as is the case in Europe). But none of these three general operational paradigms seem to provide enough comfort and security to most people.<br/>The third secular force involves disruptions to the process of economic and financial globalization that has been developing over decades.<br/>The initial trigger for this was the shift in the trade policy of US President Donald Trump's administration- from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism unilateralism), and from rules-based to more ad hoc agreements\u2014in order to create a trading system that is still free, but in turn more just. However, deglobalization has been accelerated in turbo mode by the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond China's borders.<br/>These challenges to globalization have opened the door for governments to use economic tools as weapons of war to meet goals that transcend the economy, such as those related to national security. This, in turn, is calling into question the conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management, and reliance on external demand to drive growthInternal.<br/>The final trend is demographic and involves much more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and the economic and political consequences of that trend. It also goes beyond the growing awareness that the sharply different expectations of Millennials\u2014in terms of careers, personal engagement, political action, and the provision of goods and services\u2014will persist and be they'll dig deeper.<br/>To begin with, companies need to act smarter on supplying anywhere, any location, any time.\" In addition, loyalty and tenure in employment are declining, while expectations of compliance and comprehensive commitment to employment are increasing. Self-mobilization for political and other reasons, often without a visible leadership structure, is now much easier to carry out, but is often less durable and raises difficult questions about what comes next. And all of this is happening amid the constant migration of a constantly expanding range of interactions from physical spaces to virtual spaces.<br/>Each of these forces will have a significant and similar impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments. And, while these four trends are generally challenging, they involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Therefore, executives and policymakers should make timely reviews (including preventive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches, but also to their tactical and strategic mindsets.<br/>To achieve the above correctly, it is necessary to have cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, analysis of repeated scenarios and multidisciplinary approaches. In addition, because each of the forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with many known unknowns, and probably a significant amount of unknown unknown unknowns behind those known), it is also important to have a combination of resilience, optionality and agility. And this is even before unforeseen crises are considered to occur on a regular basis, such as the Covid-19 outbreak.<br/>The challenges for good decision-making and leadership in both businesses and governments are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the necessary adaptations in relation to them. Decision makers should also consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.<br/>As a quick illustration, let us consider another aspect of demographic change: migration and the humanitarian challenges that often accompany it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of receiving waves of migratory human flows, whose income will be very difficult for them to accept and at the same time be ruthless lybined to reject.<br/>The combination of deglobalization and misuse of artificial intelligence and big data for the purpose of violating individual privacy is equally troubling. This could lead to questionable behavior by some governments and could encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.<br/>The world is in a period of accelerated change, the vanguard of which is the ever-increasing list of advances that have gone from making impossible to inevitable facts. Many (but by no means all) of the challenges faced by business and political leaders can be broken down into four secular changes thatcan help anchor the timely formulation of necessary responses at the local, national, regional and global levels. The faster companies and governments become aware of this, the more likely they are to be able to alter the balance of benefits, costs and risks in their favor.<br/>The author<br/>Mohamed A.

After all, the two presidential candidates represent two worlds and world views that could hardly be more different, even for the economy. And yet the American stock exchange has just closed at the highest level in history. At 3389.78 points, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 Index just closed at the highest level in history</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In these days, stock market participants do not seem to care much about the upcoming election on November 3. The decision on the White House and Congress is too far away. Other topics such as the squabble over the next economic stimulus package, the policy of the central bank, or the trade war between the US and China seem to dominate in the short term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US elections are likely to shake up the stock markets considerably. In addition to their president, the 328 million Americans also elect members of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate</p><p>Clever investors do not wait for the remaining 75 days to let their portfolio hit the wall with a sighted eye. \"The US elections will be the determining factor for the markets in the coming months,\" says Keith Parker, strategist at UBS</p><p>Depending on the outcome, not only are the political implications great, but also the consequences for the economy and financial markets. This offers opportunities for smart investors who position themselves now and prepare for the possible outcomes</p><p>There are three strategies for savers. Those who dare to predict the winner can put together the right portfolio. Since both candidates show a clear political edge, the result is a Trump portfolio as well as a clearly distinguishable Biden portfolio. If you have a preference but are not quite sure, you will find a combination of both portfolios that provides a hedge. Election polls and also the odds on the betting markets currently see the newly elected democratic candidate Joe Biden in the lead. The betting exchange PredictIT predicts a 57 percent chance for the 77-year-old</p><p>If Biden Trump is to replace Trump next year, there are a number of industries that were not exactly favored under the incumbent's policy. The Democrat is striving for something like an American energy turnaround.</p><p> \"Biden probably has the most ambitious clean energy program ever proposed by a US presidential candidate,\" says Thiemo Lang, manager of RobecoSAM Smart Energy.</p><p>Biden wants to invest two trillion dollars over 4 years with the goal of making the USA CO2-neutral as early as 2035, at least in power generation. The main beneficiaries would be providers of alternative energies such as those bundled in the iShares Clean Energy index fund. The five US stocks SolarEdge, Sunrun, Plug Power, Enphase Energy and First Solar are among the heavyweights in this fund, which are also likely to benefit from Biden's investments. In his fund, Lang focuses on companies without which an energy turnaround is not possible, not least companies that distribute and store energy efficiently</p><p>Cannabis suppliers are also counting on a Biden victory. The logic behind this is that if the Democrats win a majority in the election, the industry can hope for more liberal legislation overall. Investors can now find special index funds that include the industry's major players. Furthermore, providers of infrastructure projects could hope for better business under a President Joe Biden. The Democrats have announced a major spending program to modernize the partially ailing infrastructure of the United States.</p><p>In the event of a \"blue\" victory in the election, UBS economists expect real economic growth to be one percentage point higher per year. Companies that benefit from construction and other infrastructure measures would be the winners</p><p>The changes in tax policy announced by Biden are also likely to have an impact on the economy and the stock market. A higher wealth and trade tax with simultaneous relief for the lower income earners would presumably spur broad-based consumption. The companies included in the SPDR S&amp;P US Consumer Staples - including Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, WalMart and Costco - can expect rising sales and profits</p><p>Last but not least, Biden is likely to set about repairing the international relations that Trump has disrupted through his unilateral policy. Emerging markets in particular could benefit from a more diplomatic America</p><p>The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets has a particularly high weighting for China, South Korea and India. Even if not all the tariffs that Trump has imposed are withdrawn, the protectionist escalation should be averted and the deglobalisation mitigated</p><p>But a victory for the Democrats is anything but certain. Joe Biden's lead has recently shrunk significantly in both polls and betting shops. So savers would do well to have a Trump portfolio up their sleeve</p><p>The biggest potential beneficiaries of a Trump victory are America's big oil companies, especially the exploration companies that are developing the new deposits. After all, one of Trump's first official acts was to relax environmental regulations for the industry. New oil deposits could be pulled out of the ground. It is not for nothing that ETF Oil &amp; Gas Exploration runs parallel to Trump's election prospects</p><p>Beneficiaries of Trump's \"America First policy\" are also smaller values found in the Russell 2000. This should do much better than the blue chips after a re-election. But a few big players might secretly hope for Trump: Big tech must fear to be crushed or at least weakened under Biden. Trump, on the other hand, has - apart from a few verbal invectives - let Apple &amp; Co. act untouched. For tech followers, the Invesco QQQ is the right choice, bundling the 100 heavyweights of technology</p><p>Even pharmaceutical giants would probably do better with a President Trump than with a President Biden. Although the Republican has also announced that he wants to lower the price of drugs, the announcement has less credibility than the price reduction policy within the framework of general health insurance, which is favored by Democrats</p><p>Pharmaceuticals is one of the worst performing sectors on Wall Street this year. Many investors consider the major industry players to be relatively cheap. Special funds and index funds allow savers to make targeted investments in the US pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>Donald Trump would also be a plus for the defense sector. The companies in the Arca Defense sector have already performed well over the past four years and would still have a powerful advocate in the Republican, who is committed to the modernization of the US armed forces and American strength. In general, it can be said that since the end of World War II, the American stock market has performed significantly better under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones. However, this is not true if the Democrats dominate both houses of Congress in addition to the White House. In the past, this power structure has proved detrimental to Wall Street development, while the American system of \"checks and balances\" has produced the best results for the stock market and financial markets.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20200820DWBEHPFINANZENM96BPNGI2TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-172610629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MR-46M1-DY2B-S2VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 194</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000CVNZ</classCode><className>ENPHASE ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS335312 MOTOR &amp;

But the words are used to describe Tim Wu so regularly that he could be forgiven for listing \"academic superstar\" as the title on his</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">business card.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The professor at Columbia Law School in New York has emerged in recent years as one of America's foremost public intellectuals. And an unconventional one.</p><p>Wu arrives for our interview dressed in sunglasses, a flannelette shirt and a beanie. He looks more like a bass guitarist in an indie rock band than an Ivy League professor. The 46-year old used to be a regular participant at Burning Man, an alternative festival in the Nevada desert where clothing is optional and money is banned. A 2006 comedy law revue skit centred on his popularity among female students (\"I only took this class so I could stare at him,\" one performer said).</p><p>Wu is best known for inventing the phrase \"net neutrality\", the concept that internet service providers should treat all web content equally.</p><p>He is a prolific contributor to publications such as The New Yorker, The New York Times and Slate - and not just about his academic specialities of copyright, technology policy and competition law. He has also written about his love of dumplings, vintage motorcycles and doing yoga in the Himalayas.</p><p>His latest book The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust In The New Gilded Age is a slim tome but has already landed with a thud in the US.</p><p>Wu's central argument is that the US government should break up corporate monopolies - and that it should start with Facebook.</p><p>He believes new regulations - such as those proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission this week - won't do enough to weaken the power of tech giants.</p><p>\"I think regulation is guaranteed to be ineffective and even has the danger of entrenching these firms as America's great monopolists,\" he says over lunch at a diner in Chelsea, in lower Manhattan, near where he lives with his wife and children.</p><p>\"The simplest way to break the power of Facebook,\" he argues, \"is breaking up Facebook.\"</p><p>Wu thinks it was a historic mistake to allow Facebook to gobble up more than 70 other companies, most importantly the photo sharing app Instagram in 2012 and mobile messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. US regulators have not made their reasoning for those decisions public, but UK regulators did. They concluded that because Facebook did not have a photo-taking app and Instagram did not have advertising revenue, they were not competitors.</p><p>\"It takes many years of training to reach conclusions this absurd,\" Wu writes scornfully. \"A teenager could have told you that Facebook and Instagram were competitors. After all, teenagers were the ones who were switching platforms.\"</p><p>Wu says the mergers could easily be reversed, and Facebook ordered to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"While Facebook might not like being dissolved, and might find the new competition unwelcome, it is hard to see what the great social cost, if any, would be,\" he argues.</p><p>Meanwhile, he says the benefits to society would be many. Breaking up Facebook would reduce the amount of user data that can be harvested and cross-referenced. It would also allow competitors with new business models and stricter privacy standards to emerge.</p><p>Wu recalls that in the early days, the internet seemed seemed too chaotic and anarchistic for monopolies to form. Powerhouses such as AOL, Netscape and MySpace rose and fell: giants one day, laughing stocks the next. But over time, three big companies - Facebook, Amazon and Google - came to dominate the social media, online shopping and search industries respectively.</p><p>It even became fashionable in Silicon Valley to argue that monopolies should be celebrated, not feared. PayPal founder Peter Thiel summed up the zeitgeist in a 2014 Wall Street Journal piece titled \"Competition Is for Losers\".</p><p>While Wu thinks the tech sector is particularly ripe for break-ups, he argues that many sectors of the economy are too concentrated. In the US, for example, there are just three major airline companies and three regional cable television monopolies.</p><p>Massive mergers have reduced the global seed and pesticide industry to just three players and the global beer industry has consolidated into a single global firm, controlling over 2000 beer brands from Budweiser to Corona to Stella Artois.</p><p>Over lunch, I remark to Wu that this all feels very close to home. We are meeting on the day that Nine officially takes control of Fairfax Media, the previous owner of the Herald and The Age, and forms a massive new TV, radio and newspaper company.</p><p>Wu primarily blames George W. Bush's administration for the massive corporate consolidation that has occurred in the US.</p><p>But he says Barack Obama's administration - where he worked for a short stint as an economic adviser - was too \"risk averse\" to prevent big mergers.</p><p>\"We let a lot of things go that we shouldn't have,\" he says. \"A mistake Obama made in his first term was ingratiating himself with the establishment of the Democratic Party. He hired a lot of old-time Washington insiders, people who planned to go back to work for big corporations. They are not going to be very aggressive about taking on big business.\"</p><p>Although smashing up America's biggest companies may sound radical, it isn't a new idea. In fact, Wu is trying to revive a long-lost American tradition. Taking on monopolies was central to the agenda of Theodore Roosevelt, who served as president from 1901 to 1909. He ordered the break up of Standard Oil - then the largest private firm in the world - into 34 constituent parts. He also forced the dissolution of a massive railroad trust into three separate firms.</p><p>Roosevelt opposed monopolies not just on economic grounds but because he believed they undermined democracy. If firms became too powerful, they would overpower politicians and undermine the will of voters.</p><p>But in later years that idea went out of fashion. A much stricter interpretation - that mergers should only be blocked if they will increase prices - took hold. The US government hasn't ordered a big corporate break-up since the telephone company AT&amp;T in 1982.</p><p>But now the idea of government intervention seems to be coming back into vogue. \"The ground is starting to shift on these issues,\" Wu says. \"A lot of things are being re-examined.\" Opponents have labelled Wu and his fellow travellers as the \"hipster anti-trust movement\" and say they advocate a populist, evidence-free approach to competition policy.</p><p>\"The drumbeat for this revolution is strong and growing, with a broad range of enthusiastic participants and devotees, including public intellectuals and think tankers, as well as prominent members of Congress,\" George Mason University law professor Joshua Wright and others wrote in a September paper.</p><p>The Democratic Party's policy platform, A Better Deal, lists cracking down on corporate monopolies and the abuse of economic and political power as one of its key planks. And several potential presidential nominees, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are running hard on the issue. \"I personally think a Democratic candidate who doesn't speak to these issues will not go anywhere in 2020,\" Wu says. \"I expect private power excessive corporate domination of politics to be a litmus test for a lot of Democratic voters.\"</p><p>He believes creating a more competitive economy will not just bring prices down, but reduce the anger and extremism that dominates contemporary US politics.</p><p>\"A lot of people are questioning the basics of democracy in America now and asking who is in charge,\" he says.</p><p>\"Long term, if the public doesn't get what it wants and feels like it is powerless, it is very dangerous. It leads to conditions ripe for revolution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc736rf1hudte4giru98y</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYM-FD51-JD34-V36B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

That's a question the capital markets have been asking for some time, and is a leading concern of the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. But this question matters beyond those interested in investing in, regulating, or even starting companies. As the SEC put it recently, startups going public benefit the overall economy because \"they tend to be more innovative than large companies and they account for a substantial percentage of the jobs created every year.\"</p><p>Here are the facts: About two decades ago, the U.S. had 300 IPOs per year. Since then, that average has fallen by more than half, which means publicly listed stocks in the U.S. declined by 50 percent from 1996 to 2016. Even more troubling, however, is that other developed countries experienced a 50 percent increase in listed companies over the same period, and that the type of IPO candidates have changed as well: \"Small-cap IPOs\" (with less than $50 million in revenue) have declined significantly. Besides fewer jobs, companies staying private longer means public market investors, who rely on the growth to diversify risk and fund retirement obligations, are also being left out of the spoils of new company creation. Many of these companies are essentially offering \"quasi-IPOs\" in the private markets, and can afford to do so simply because there is alternative financing in the form of mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity buyout firms, sovereign wealth funds, and many others besides venture capitalists.</p><p>The phenomenon is clear, and there is a lot of research offering theories to explain the data, but a few common themes emerge: All signs point to liquidity as a culprit. If institutional investors have to pay an \"illiquidity tax\" on every buy or sell stock transaction, they will naturally deploy capital elsewhere. One avenue that might enhance liquidity, particularly for small-cap companies, is the tick-size pilot that the SEC is conducting. It restricts the increments at which stocks can trade (thus aggregating trading volume). Other approaches to increasing liquidity, particularly for new issues, might include reducing the number of trading venues to better aggregate volume and modifying the short interest rules to include volume limits or enhanced disclosures. Increasing the economic attractiveness of research and market-making for small cap stocks is also worth exploring. Finally, easing mutual fund concentration restrictions that limit their holdings in individual companies might also encourage more investment in the smaller-capitalization end of the trading market. Short-term pressures reduce long-term investments. Adopting tenure-based voting is one of the best ways to balance the short- and long-term interests of investors and managers. Under this structure, voting rights increase for all investors with longer holding periods. \"Drive-by\" investors who are only seeking to trade short term would have less governance influence than those who are supporting or building the company long term. Another idea to consider is Nasdaq's recent suggestion of requiring institutional investors to disclose material short positions (just as they already do material long positions) as a way to increase transparency and decrease short-term pressures. Regulatory costs and burdens should be proportional to potential impact. Compliance clearly matters to ensure the safe functioning of the capital markets for all. But the SEC can still accomplish this goal while also considering that the cost of regulation applied to a company such as IBM is grossly disproportionate when applied to a company with a market capitalization of less than $1 billion, especially since the scale of risk to the public due to bad behavior is much smaller. So \"rightsizing\" regulations that scale with the size and market cap of the company makes more sense.</p><p>Interestingly, the JOBS Act was created in 2012 precisely to solve the problem of too few IPOs. Most of the good things it did involved making the process of going public easier: confidential filings; enabling companies to test the waters with institutional investors pre-offering; and size-adjusting regulatory burdens for emerging growth companies. Yet in upping SEC registration requirements from 500 to 2,000 outside shareholders, the JOBS Act also, paradoxically, made it easier for companies to remain private.</p><p>What can we do to help companies thrive, while also honoring the multi-modal mandate of the SEC to protect everyone?</p><p>Recently, one of the most successful tech companies of the age -- Amazon -- celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. But it's also a case study in how government incentives play an important role and can have unintended consequences, for better and worse. Where is the next Amazon? Or perhaps more importantly: Where is the smaller-cap company -- not the unicorn -- that can become the next big tech enterprise, the next high-growth opportunity?</p><p>(Bloomberg LP is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.)</p><p>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p><p>Scott Kupor is managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>To contact the author of this story: Scott Kupor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:scott@a16z.com\">scott@a16z.com</email></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Max Berley at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mberley@bloomberg.net\">mberley@bloomberg.net</email></p><p>For more columns from Bloomberg View, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view\">http://www.bloomberg.com/view</url>.</p><p>cc2017 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LASCRU-31076904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LASCRUCMNG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NV3-HB71-JCB3-408D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280046</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Las Cruces Sun-News, a MediaNews Group Newspaper All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Las Cruces Sun-News (New Mexico)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 19, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Administration &amp;
