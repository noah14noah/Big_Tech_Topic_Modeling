A brief reintroduction. Net Neutrality is theTrojan Horse[2]that gets the government very thoroughly into the business of regulating the Internet. The Internet being the place for nigh all things free speech and free market going forward. Net Neutrality - is your one-stop-shop for all things government censorship and control of the Web. </p><p>Under the phony guise of 'neutrality,' 'equality' and 'fairness' - the government would be able to do to the Internet exactly what, say,the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did to President Barack Obama's political opponents[3]. Only in a much more all-encompassing fashion - because the Internet is increasingly everything. You see whatBig Tech Facebook, Twitter and Google do to political people they don't like[4]? Instantaneous silencing and banishment. Net Neutrality allows the government - to do exactly what these Big Tech companies do. To show you just how much the Left wants the government to be able to do all of this - they are setting up some seriously ridiculous impediments to settling the Net Neutrality question in any sort of reasonable manner. Like insisting on the ban of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' About which Congress will on April 17 hold a hearing. House Panel to Hold Hearing on Net Neutrality, Internet 'Fast Lanes'[5]: 'The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing later this month on internet fast lanes, a major source of concern for net neutrality supporters and a sticking point in efforts to come up with a bipartisan net neutrality bill. 'In December, the Republican-ledFederal Communications Commission (FCC)voted to repeal the agency's net neutrality rules, which banned internet service providers from blocking or throttling web traffic. The regulations also prohibited paid prioritization, or charging web services for faster speeds.' Oh no - 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' That's awful. That's horrendous. They must be banned.Except they aren't awful or horrendous - and they happen all the time everywhere else on the planet. Oh: And they already happen all the time on the Internet too.Oh: And the ban the Left wishes the government to impose - applies only to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Not to the exponentially-larger Big Tech company likes of Google (market cap: $701 billion[6]), Amazon (market cap: $680 billion[7]) and Facebook (market cap: $467 billion[8]). These Big Tech companies have spent the last decade-plus - paying Leftist groups to insist that it be this way. But the examples of private sector 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - are nigh endless. Let's examine just one. When you send a letter or package - are you limited to one delivery speed? Of course not. To chose but one private sector provider at random: UPS offersseven different delivery options[9]: UPS Next Day Air Early, UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select and UPS Ground. Heck, the government post office offers five different delivery options -right there on its government website[10]. These are all variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' And no one is demanding the government ban them - because anyone who would do so would look titanically stupid. But the Left wants to have the government - whose post office offers five different variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - ban 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' on the Internet. But again - only for ISPs. For the Big Tech companies, Internet 'paid prioritization' 'fast lines' - are just fine. In fact, there are hundreds of thousands (millions?) of them - and they have for years and years been an intrinsic part of the World Wide Web. Behold theContent Delivery Network (CDN)[11]: '(A) geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance. 'CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays ISPs, carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.' Did you get all that? 'CDNs are a layer in the ecosystem.' Which means they aren't separate from the Internet - they are a connate part of it. And Big Tech uses the heck out of CDN 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes': 'Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users.' That's Big Tech companies like Amazon - who are both content owners (Amazon Prime video) and the largest of e-commerce vendors. And they're using fast lanes to get to their usersfaster. And paying for said prioritization. Meanwhile, Big Tech companies like Amazon - are trying to prohibit ISPs from doing exactly the same thing. Which is actually a very stupid thing - for everyone who uses the Internet. The more 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - the better. It gets Big Tech bandwidth hogs out of the way - so the rest of us don't get stuck behind and amongst them. And yes, Big Tech can afford to pay for more bandwidth - while Little Tech can not. But here's the dirty little secret: Little Tech uses a tiny fraction of the bandwidth Big Tech uses - so they won't be charged extra for their bandwidth. Becausemath. If you buy 1,000 cases of beer - you pay more than you do for a six-pack. Which delivers us another dirty little secret: Big Tech wants government-imposed Net Neutrality and a ban on ISP paid prioritization - because Big Tech doesn't want to pay for all the huge bandwidth they use. So they'll have government ban the ISPs from charging them for it. There it is[12]. Oh: And when the government bans ISPs from charging Big Tech bandwidth hogs for being bandwidth hogs - guess who pays exponentially more to pick up the slack? That's right - you and I. We pay oh-so-much-more for Internet service - to augment Big Tech's profits. How's that for cronyism? Oh: And Big Tech is paying the Left -for prioritization of the issue[13]: 'Net Neutrality activists and Democrats are also trying to makenet neutrality a campaign issue, betting the issue will work against Republicans in this fall's midterm elections.' There it is.

A brief reintroduction. Net Neutrality is the\u00a0Trojan Horse[2]\u00a0that gets the government very thoroughly into the business of regulating the Internet. The Internet being the place for nigh all things free speech and free market going forward. Net Neutrality - is your one-stop-shop for all things government censorship and control of the Web. </p><p>Under the phony guise of 'neutrality,' 'equality' and 'fairness' - the government would be able to do to the Internet exactly what, say,\u00a0the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did to President Barack Obama's political opponents[3]. Only in a much more all-encompassing fashion - because the Internet is increasingly everything. You see what\u00a0Big Tech Facebook, Twitter and Google do to political people they don't like[4]? Instantaneous silencing and banishment. Net Neutrality allows the government - to do exactly what these Big Tech companies do. To show you just how much the Left wants the government to be able to do all of this - they are setting up some seriously ridiculous impediments to settling the Net Neutrality question in any sort of reasonable manner. Like insisting on the ban of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' About which Congress will on April 17 hold a hearing. House Panel to Hold Hearing on Net Neutrality, Internet 'Fast Lanes'[5]: 'The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing later this month on internet fast lanes, a major source of concern for net neutrality supporters and a sticking point in efforts to come up with a bipartisan net neutrality bill. 'In December, the Republican-led\u00a0Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\u00a0voted to repeal the agency's net neutrality rules, which banned internet service providers from blocking or throttling web traffic. The regulations also prohibited paid prioritization, or charging web services for faster speeds.' Oh no - 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' That's awful. That's horrendous. They must be banned.Except they aren't awful or horrendous - and they happen all the time everywhere else on the planet. Oh: And they already happen all the time on the Internet too.Oh: And the ban the Left wishes the government to impose - applies only to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Not to the exponentially-larger Big Tech company likes of Google (market cap: $701 billion[6]), Amazon (market cap: $680 billion[7]) and Facebook (market cap: $467 billion[8]). These Big Tech companies have spent the last decade-plus - paying Leftist groups to insist that it be this way. But the examples of private sector 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - are nigh endless. Let's examine just one. When you send a letter or package - are you limited to one delivery speed? Of course not. To chose but one private sector provider at random: UPS offers\u00a0seven different delivery options[9]: UPS Next Day Air Early, UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select and UPS Ground. Heck, the government post office offers five different delivery options -\u00a0right there on its government website[10]. These are all variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' And no one is demanding the government ban them - because anyone who would do so would look titanically stupid. But the Left wants to have the government - whose post office offers five different variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - ban 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' on the Internet. But again - only for ISPs. For the Big Tech companies, Internet 'paid prioritization' 'fast lines' - are just fine. In fact, there are hundreds of thousands (millions?) of them - and they have for years and years been an intrinsic part of the World Wide Web. Behold the\u00a0Content Delivery Network (CDN)[11]: '(A) geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance. 'CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays ISPs, carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.' Did you get all that? 'CDNs are a layer in the ecosystem.' Which means they aren't separate from the Internet - they are a connate part of it. And Big Tech uses the heck out of CDN 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes': 'Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users.' That's Big Tech companies like Amazon - who are both content owners (Amazon Prime video) and the largest of e-commerce vendors. And they're using fast lanes to get to their usersfaster. And paying for said prioritization. Meanwhile, Big Tech companies like Amazon - are trying to prohibit ISPs from doing exactly the same thing. Which is actually a very stupid thing - for everyone who uses the Internet. The more 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - the better. It gets Big Tech bandwidth hogs out of the way - so the rest of us don't get stuck behind and amongst them. And yes, Big Tech can afford to pay for more bandwidth - while Little Tech can not. But here's the dirty little secret: Little Tech uses a tiny fraction of the bandwidth Big Tech uses - so they won't be charged extra for their bandwidth. Becausemath. If you buy 1,000 cases of beer - you pay more than you do for a six-pack. Which delivers us another dirty little secret: Big Tech wants government-imposed Net Neutrality and a ban on ISP paid prioritization - because Big Tech doesn't want to pay for all the huge bandwidth they use. So they'll have government ban the ISPs from charging them for it. There it is[12]. Oh: And when the government bans ISPs from charging Big Tech bandwidth hogs for being bandwidth hogs - guess who pays exponentially more to pick up the slack? That's right - you and I. We pay oh-so-much-more for Internet service - to augment Big Tech's profits. How's that for cronyism? Oh: And Big Tech is paying the Left -\u00a0for prioritization of the issue[13]: 'Net Neutrality activists and Democrats are also trying to make\u00a0net neutrality a campaign issue, betting the issue will work against Republicans in this fall's midterm elections.' There it is.

A brief reintroduction. Net Neutrality is theTrojan Horse[2]that gets the government very thoroughly into the business of regulating the Internet. The Internet being the place for nigh all things free speech and free market going forward. Net Neutrality - is your one-stop-shop for all things government censorship and control of the Web. </p><p>Under the phony guise of 'neutrality,' 'equality' and 'fairness' - the government would be able to do to the Internet exactly what, say,the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did to President Barack Obama's political opponents[3]. Only in a much more all-encompassing fashion - because the Internet is increasingly everything. You see whatBig Tech Facebook, Twitter and Google do to political people they don't like[4]? Instantaneous silencing and banishment. Net Neutrality allows the government - to do exactly what these Big Tech companies do. To show you just how much the Left wants the government to be able to do all of this - they are setting up some seriously ridiculous impediments to settling the Net Neutrality question in any sort of reasonable manner. Like insisting on the ban of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' About which Congress will on April 17 hold a hearing. House Panel to Hold Hearing on Net Neutrality, Internet 'Fast Lanes'[5]: 'The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing later this month on internet fast lanes, a major source of concern for net neutrality supporters and a sticking point in efforts to come up with a bipartisan net neutrality bill. 'In December, the Republican-ledFederal Communications Commission (FCC)voted to repeal the agency's net neutrality rules, which banned internet service providers from blocking or throttling web traffic. The regulations also prohibited paid prioritization, or charging web services for faster speeds.' Oh no - 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' That's awful. That's horrendous. They must be banned. Except they aren't awful or horrendous - and they happen all the time everywhere else on the planet. Oh: And they already happen all the time on the Internet too. Oh: And the ban the Left wishes the government to impose - applies only to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Not to the exponentially-larger Big Tech company likes of Google (market cap: $701 billion[6]), Amazon (market cap: $680 billion[7]) and Facebook (market cap: $467 billion[8]). These Big Tech companies have spent the last decade-plus - paying Leftist groups to insist that it be this way. But the examples of private sector 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - are nigh endless. Let's examine just one. When you send a letter or package - are you limited to one delivery speed? Of course not. To chose but one private sector provider at random: UPS offersseven different delivery options[9]: UPS Next Day Air Early, UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select and UPS Ground. Heck, the government post office offers five different delivery options -right there on its government website[10]. These are all variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes.' And no one is demanding the government ban them - because anyone who would do so would look titanically stupid. But the Left wants to have the government - whose post office offers five different variations of 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - ban 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' on the Internet. But again - only for ISPs. For the Big Tech companies, Internet 'paid prioritization' 'fast lines' - are just fine. In fact, there are hundreds of thousands (millions?) of them - and they have for years and years been an intrinsic part of the World Wide Web. Behold theContent Delivery Network (CDN)[11]: '(A) geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance. 'CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays ISPs, carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.' Did you get all that? 'CDNs are a layer in the ecosystem.' Which means they aren't separate from the Internet - they are a connate part of it. And Big Tech uses the heck out of CDN 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes': 'Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users.' That's Big Tech companies like Amazon - who are both content owners (Amazon Prime video) and the largest of e-commerce vendors. And they're using fast lanes to get to their usersfaster. And paying for said prioritization. Meanwhile, Big Tech companies like Amazon - are trying to prohibit ISPs from doing exactly the same thing. Which is actually a very stupid thing - for everyone who uses the Internet. The more 'paid prioritization' 'fast lanes' - the better. It gets Big Tech bandwidth hogs out of the way - so the rest of us don't get stuck behind and amongst them. And yes, Big Tech can afford to pay for more bandwidth - while Little Tech can not. But here's the dirty little secret: Little Tech uses a tiny fraction of the bandwidth Big Tech uses - so they won't be charged extra for their bandwidth. Becausemath. If you buy 1,000 cases of beer - you pay more than you do for a six-pack. Which delivers us another dirty little secret: Big Tech wants government-imposed Net Neutrality and a ban on ISP paid prioritization - because Big Tech doesn't want to pay for all the huge bandwidth they use. So they'll have government ban the ISPs from charging them for it. There it is[12]. Oh: And when the government bans ISPs from charging Big Tech bandwidth hogs for being bandwidth hogs - guess who pays exponentially more to pick up the slack? That's right - you and I. We pay oh-so-much-more for Internet service - to augment Big Tech's profits. How's that for cronyism? Oh: And Big Tech is paying the Left -for prioritization of the issue[13]: 'Net Neutrality activists and Democrats are also trying to makenet neutrality a campaign issue, betting the issue will work against Republicans in this fall's midterm elections.' There it is.

A new year is usually the time when we regain confidence in the future and in our collective ability to prepare for it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However there are many uncertainties weighing on the global economic outlook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, there are still many uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the vote over the withdrawal agreement. Caution requires that we all be prepared for a no-deal scenario. Public authorities and most importantly market participants have all prepared serious contingency plans to address and master the cliff-edge risks associated with such a no-deal scenario. As a result, we can expect that those risks will be appropriately managed, without financial stability implications, should such a scenario occur.</p><p>Outside Europe, global trade tensions are also generating additional uncertainties. Protectionism can indeed be a temptation, but in my view it should not be an option. Let's be clear: our economies are increasingly integrated, and research conducted at the Banque de France suggests that a rise in protectionism on a large scale (i.e. a generalised trade war scenario) would have a negative impact on global growth.</p><p>Yet these uncertainties can be turned into opportunities and I would like to emphasise that. It is worth noting that EU Member States remained impressively united behind their negotiator, Michel Barnier, during the Brexit talks. This unity must now be directed towards achieving an ambition: completing and strengthening the economic and monetary union.</p><p>This period of uncertainties actually reminds us that bilateral and multilateral cooperation are quite valuable, as they are a common wealth enhancer, especially when the issue at stake is financial regulation and financial stability. At the end of 2017, central bankers and supervisors reached a very important agreement on the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. This agreement must now be implemented in various jurisdictions to further increase the soundness of the banking system. Since the great financial crisis, other issues have emerged. Cyber-risks have risen significantly over the last few years and the financial sector remains a primary target. The surge of crypto-assets is another challenge for regulators given the risks they pose for consumer protection and anti-money laundering. To address these risks adequately, the digital and global nature of crypto-assets calls for an international approach.</p><p>Cooperation is all the more necessary as the major financial centres, including Paris and Hong Kong, are highly interconnected.</p><p>I believe that Paris today has all the attributes necessary to become the pre-eminent financial trading and financing hub for continental Europe. Some of the world's biggest banks, asset managers and insurers are already preparing for life after Brexit and steering their European operations away from London to our capital. Paris is already home to four of the eight global systemically important banks in the euro area, in addition to being number one in the region in insurance and asset management. Recent regulatory initiatives have made Paris even more dynamic. Capitalising on the reform of Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEU CP) in 2016, a number of very innovative projects have been launched: for instance, the French telecoms company Orange and the fintech SETL have jointly set up a new central securities depository (CSD) called ID2S for the NEU CP market, using blockchain technology.</p><p>Paris is also at the heart of cross-border initiatives, making the European financial market more integrated. The market exchange operator Euronext is continuing to expand its federal model and in November 2017 acquired the Irish Stock Exchange. The CSD Euroclear is also committed to fostering common infrastructures, and is even looking beyond Europe with partnerships in the United States with DTCC or in Asia thanks to Bond Connect.</p><p>Building on this comprehensive financial ecosystem, Paris has also been one of the principal supporters of the renminbi's move towards internationalisation. As of today, Paris is indeed the leading continental European centre for deposits and bond issuances in RMB. This support was embodied and exemplified as early as 2014 with the signature by the Banque of France of two memorandums of understanding with the HKMA and the People's Bank of China.</p><p>Cooperation will also prove invaluable in the face of the uncertainty caused by structural challenges.</p><p>A first structural challenge is the digital revolution. The digital revolution is being fuelled by a wave of cutting-edge technologies, but also by the surge of new players. This new competition is being driven by fintech start-ups, but also, more importantly, by tech firms that have started to expand into the financial sector. Here in Asia, you can testify as to just how rapidly big tech firms can impact the financial sector.</p><p>While ensuring a level playing field between competitors, our role as a central bank and supervisor is to guarantee that the digital revolution eventually delivers on its promises regarding increased security and efficiency. At the same time, incumbents should be prepared to adapt. Their business models are being challenged by the unbundling of financial services and by increasing customer expectations in terms of responsiveness and autonomy.</p><p>The answers are not easy and cannot be uniform, but I expect that only the most digitally agile financial companies will eventually prove financially resilient.</p><p>Against this background, France has many assets that can make it a leader in digital innovation in Europe, and the Banque de France is committed to playing its part in this regard. Through its Fintech Innovation Hub, which has welcomed over 400 innovative players since 2016, the Banque de France promotes active and open dialogue with all market stakeholders, with the aim of building streamlined regulation for digital innovation.</p><p>The Banque de France is also committed to leveraging new technologies for its own digital transformation. We are already running an interbank blockchain called \"MADRE\" to automate the generation of creditor identifiers. I am convinced that by conducting their own experiments, central banks and regulators are more capable of designing relevant policies and regulations for digital finance.<br/><br/>A second structural challenge is climate change, which is perhaps less tangible than the digital revolution but certainly no less significant.</p><p>The transition to a low-carbon economy requires shifting thousands of billions of dollars from carbon intensive industries. As a result, beyond green bonds, we also have to develop new financial products to bridge this green finance gap. I am thinking of green securitisation, green covered bonds, and green loans accessible to individuals, SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>France is at the forefront of this challenge. Four out of the world's top ten green bond book-runners are French banks. France is among the top three green bond issuers. This trend is being supported by public action: a law has been introduced requiring investors and listed companies to disclose their climate-related risks; the French State issued the largest green sovereign bond in 2017.</p><p>We also believe that central banks and supervisors must play their part as, in the long run, climate stability is one of the main determinants of financial stability, which is their mandate. This is a shared conviction. At the One Planet Summit in Paris in December 2017, the Banque de France, with the support of other central banks and supervisors, launched the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which now comprises some 30 central banks, supervisors and international organisations, including four Asian members, and will certainly attract more in the coming years.</p><p>Let me now conclude by quoting Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the famous author of The Black Swan. He once wrote that uncertainties can be like the wind which \"extinguishes a candle and energises fire\", and added the following: \"You want to use them, not hide from them. You want to be the fire and wish for the wind\". My wish is that the ongoing uncertainties will become the wind that deepens our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. On that hopeful note, I wish you a very Happy New Year and for the time being an inspiring and fruitful conference.</p><p>Disclaimer: The full PDF release can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/discours-d-beau_-paris-financial-seminar-20190116.pdf\">https://www.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/discours-d-beau_-paris-financial-seminar-20190116.pdf</url></p><p>Source: Banque de France</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0046296598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7Y-2FM1-JB5M-W151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1451\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002EIQ</classCode><className>BANQUE DE FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Elias Ghanem, vice-pr\u00e9sident fintech pour l'Europe continentale chez Capgemini, lance un message clair : \u00ab La maison est en feu ! Il faut passer \u00e0 la collaboration effective et adopter de nouvelles technologies en urgence, estime-t-il. C'est une question de survie pour les fintech et pour les \u00e9tablissements traditionnels car les 'big tech' - Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon... - arrivent dans le secteur financier et sont susceptibles de rafler tr\u00e8s vite l'adh\u00e9sion des consommateurs. Il est temps de s'y mettre ! \u00bb<br/><br/>Heureusement, les grands acteurs de la banque et de l'assurance n'ont pas attendu cette alerte pour multiplier les collaborations avec les jeunes pousses innovantes. </p><p>Les fintech apportent leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 enrichir l'exp\u00e9rience client en s'appropriant les nouvelles technologies (usage de la data, intelligence artificielle, interfaces intuitives, automatisation des processus, cloud, API-interfaces de programmation...), ce qui leur permet d'\u00eatre agiles et d'offrir un service directement consommable sur mobile. \u00ab Les fintech comblent le foss\u00e9 entre les offres des \u00e9tablissements traditionnels et les attentes des clients \u00bb, souligne le rapport. Mais elles ont besoin de trouver le bon partenaire pour faire fructifier leur innovation, car les banques d\u00e9tiennent la confiance des clients, elles ont des infrastructures robustes, savent g\u00e9rer les relations avec les r\u00e9gulateurs et jouissent d'un outil permettant les \u00e9conomies d'\u00e9chelle.<br/><br/>Large foss\u00e9 cuLturel<br/><br/>L'alliance entre les deux devrait \u00eatre naturelle mais elle est handicap\u00e9e par le manque de souplesse des \u00e9tablissements traditionnels et leur manque de volont\u00e9 de faire aboutir les partenariats. Le foss\u00e9 culturel est large, la r\u00e9glementation lourde et les technologies pas toujours compatibles. Pour surmonter ces difficult\u00e9s, le World Fintech Report recommande aux banques de reprendre \u00e0 leur compte les \u00ab strat\u00e9gies qui catalysent le succ\u00e8s \u00bb : avoir de l'empathie pour les clients, maintenir leur confiance, simplifier la relation, offrir l'excellence op\u00e9rationnelle, investir dans les capacit\u00e9s num\u00e9riques, aligner les objectifs de l'entreprise sur ceux des clients, adopter les principes agiles et rajeunir la culture d'entreprise et les talents. \u00ab Engagez-vous avec les start-up et appliquez ces recettes \u00e0 fond ! \u00bb, les encourage Elias Ghanem.<br/><br/>Pour ce faire, Capgemini propose aux jeunes pousses une \u00ab scale-up certification \u00bb : une \u00e9valuation de leur niveau de maturit\u00e9 et de leur potentiel, comprenant une certification que les entreprises ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 lev\u00e9 au moins un million d'euros et disposent d'une \u00e9quipe de management embauch\u00e9e et de clients payant le service. La certification servira ensuite \u00e0 les mettre en relation avec les \u00e9tablissements traditionnels pour lancer une collaboration fructueuse. Capgemini a aussi identifi\u00e9 les facteurs de risques qui emp\u00eachent parfois banques et fintech de travailler correctement ensemble. Enfin, le World Fintech Report examine la strat\u00e9gie des g\u00e9ants de la technologie, tels Alibaba ou Amazon, et souligne leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s'appuyer sur des partenariats pour offrir une exp\u00e9rience client d'excellente qualit\u00e9 qui augmente les attentes des consommateurs.<br/><br/>Pour aller plus loin, le World Fintech Report 2018 dans la version digitale de L'AGEFI HEBDO</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEHBD-1458814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEHBD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTJ-8BN1-DY82-K046-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 L'AGEFI Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>L'AGEFI Hebdo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19466\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>mars 8 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Many, even the biggest, are worried that if they do not make the transformation quickly enough, they will be replaced by rising institutions which are innovating faster and may even leave a gap for new-style, digitalised entrants to the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the fact that private banks claim to haveembarkedona\"digitaljourney\",theinaugural Wealth Tech Awards process reveals one truth above all else: that there is only really a tightly knit vanguardamongthebankswhoare serious players in digitalisation. Our judges estimate that despite the demise of the analogue environment, only around 20 per cent of the private banking industry is seriously grasping the transformative effect that digitalisation can potentially have on their operating models.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking at the award winners, which stand out in these clusters of excellence, the giants of UBS, Credit Suisse and Citi are represented, as are the rising cross-border hopefuls such as BNP Paribas and ABN Amro. The French bank is probably among the institutions to be furthest down the digital conversion path.</p><p>The national champions, the likes of Spain's Caixa and BBVA and Coutts in the UK, have also been impressive. We must not forget also that muchinnovationinthisspherehasbeencoming from Asia, where the likes of regional powerhouse DBS and Korea's KEB Hana Bank have long been prime movers.</p><p>In addition to BNP Paribas and ABN Amro, technology consultant Urs Bolt, a former Swiss banker, particulary commends the approach of the Spanish, Scandinavian and Czech banks. \"We can clearly see that size is not the most important feature of the leading innovators,\" he suggests, with plenty of room for collaboration between small and mid-sized banks and the fintechs, wealthtechs and regtechs.</p><p>But in the traditional banking heartlands of Switzerland, for instance, once we have mentioned the top two Zurich houses, technological innovation has never been seen as part of the industry's fabric or major selling points. Certainly, post the US Department of Justice actions and the introduction of Common Reporting Standards, CEOs have returned to talking about the old stalwarts of discretion and quality of service, perhaps mentioning expertise inworkingwithfamiliesandevenportfoliomanagement, or investment skills.</p><p>Technological platforms and applications rarely, if ever, enter this broader conversation. While commercial pressure means this is soon likely to change,todayonlyahandfulofbanking leaders are brave enough to put their heads above the parapet to discuss digital transformation, for fear of being exposed or caught out of step with their peer group.</p><p>\"Industry leaders in private banking typically fall into one of two camps,\" comments awards judge and wealth consultant, April Rudin. \"Either they haven't got much to show for digitalisation, or they lack the confidence to show anything for fear that their first 'digital steps' are insufficient to withstand scrutiny.\"</p><p>As we can see from submissions to our awards, many private banks have hopped gingerly onto the digital bandwagon by creating \"innovation departments\", or worse still simply by appointing \"chief digital officers\", expected to anoint all the other bankers they see with a sprinkle of all-curing digital elixir. This narrow silo-led approach - even involving the creation of new silos - is one of the ills private banks and asset managers have suffered from for many years. Instead of seizing this new opportunity to rebuild, with a digital focus, most are treading down the same path along which they sleepwalked straight into the financial crisis and out the other side.</p><p>Instead of narrowing the digital gap, private banks run the risk of widening it, with Ms Rudin detecting a growing cultural divide between the \"suits\" and the \"hoodies\", often reluctant to work with each other.</p><p>Ratherthanappointingoneindividualorcreating a special ops unit to digitialise the people and processes of an entire bank, wealth management firms are faced with a huge opportunity to transformtheirpracticesandpeople,believesMs Rudin.\"Banks that marry the best of what they were to the best of what they can be will be best positioned to grow profitably,\" she says.</p><p>The general feeling among the judges is that most bankshavea long way to go in terms ofdigitaldevelopment.MrBoltdescribesthebehaviour of most private banks as \"quite helpless\" in their traditional approaches and structures, which do little to address clients' 21st century needs. Most innovations,hebelievesareoftenlittlemorethan \"showcases\" used for marketing stunts.</p><p>Whatbanksneedtolookat,agreethejudges, is using digital technology productively for both their clients' and their own commercial needs in order to boost numbers and KPIs.</p><p>This commercialisation of the digital landscape is a key theme for independent consultant Seb Dovey, who has worked on digital transformation projects with a number of banks. A move towards the digital model, he believes, is not just about cutting costs and making processes more efficient, but about creating opportunities to sell more products and generate more fees through targeted advice. \"Too many initiatives around digital are essentially defensive efforts to address a much broader issue of declining fee sched-ules,\" calculatesMrDovey. \"Digitalinitiativesare seen as a way of mitigating costs on processes that were previously delivered manually.\"</p><p>The market, he feels, is chasing an end-game which minimises human input rather than using technology to highlight, enhance it and make it commercially more valuable. This new direction, he insists, must come from board members, currently focused purely on regulation, compliance andcompensation,ratherthantheskillsandculture needed for a new digital landscape. Indeed our panel sees a challenging landscape ahead, but one full of opportunities nevertheless, particularly for those banks able to cooperate with fintechs and technology vendors, and able to learn from the work of external platforms prevalent in China, such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and the Ping An Group. Cybersecurity and data privacy are seen as particular challenges to overcome. But major innovations such as facial recognition and progress in data storage, analysis and manipulation, with the increased use of blockchain concepts, are all expected to take root within the next two years.</p><p>Progress in use of big data and artificial intelligence has perhaps been slower than expected, but the fruits of experiments being cooked up in the US are expected to soon be with us.</p><p>The interplay between technological and commercial factors, with a cautiously optimistic outlook for the industry, is summed up by Sydney, Australia-based consultant Mario Bassi. \"Thefourthindustrialrevolution - similar toprevious industrial revolutions - will create a lot of good outcomes for the customer,\" he says. \"However, these major investments are made - like in the past - to increase profits.\"</p><p>BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, GLOBAL; BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, EUROPE BNP PARIBAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT Toexcelindigitaltransformationanduseoftechnology does not mean merely promoting a few disparate initiatives, but creating a whole new mindset and way of working, explains Mariam Rassai, head of client experience at BNP Paribas WM. \"We are dealing with fundamental changes in our clients' mindset, how they want to be served and considered. We want to develop both adigitalisationstrategyforourprivateclientsand a strong culture of innovation.\"</p><p>At the French institution, the journey started with the appointment, ahead of competitors, of a chief digital officer five years ago, and the launch of a programme in 2016 to identify clients' expectations. Last year the private bank, which manages (EURO)362bn ($420bn) globally, launched a 'new Client Experience (CX)' aimed at developing prototype 'minimum viable' products, together with clients and in partnership with fintechs.</p><p>From the bank's three factories, or incubators, in Singapore, Geneva and BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, GLOBAL BNP PARIBAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, EUROPE CAIXABANK BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, CEE KOMERCN\u00cd BANKA, A.S.

Continuous client feedback provides valuable insights to enhance the customer experience, she adds.</p><p>The bank has launched 20 new digital servicessofar,includingmyAdvisory,providingpersonalised financial advisory via a smartphone, myChat&amp;Trade, which enables clients to trade products and markets, and the Leaders' connection, where ultra high net worth individuals can interact, share investment ideas and find coinvestors in a secure way.</p><p>myWealth is the bank's new \"one-stop-digital platform\" for international clients, offering a secure biometric connection, customised investment advice, a chatroom, videoconferencing, as well as an electronic safe. New features are currently being tested, such as myMeeting, a platform which helps clients prepare for meetings with their private banker and myVirtualAssistant, which allows 24/7 access to the bank thanks to AI. With myFeedback, clients can suggest improvements and express their needs. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, EUROPE CAIXABANK Spain's banks, including Caixa, are among Europe's vanguard in terms of digital innovation. As one of the country's key consolidators, Caixa has more or less been forced to lead the digital field, as it had to somehow integrate the platforms of the smaller banks it was acquiring after the global financial crisis and decided the best way to do this was to totally rebuild its technology infrastructure and to give clients a much more satisfying experience at the same time.</p><p>Rather than bank initiatives and staff appointments in the technology sphere, Victor Allende, head of private and premier banking at CaixaBank, describes the approach as a \"service model strategy\", offering customers independence and balance between customised advice and digital capabilities. While the portfolio manager is required to \"nurture\" the relationship, the customer decides how and where to receive financial advice.</p><p>The bank's recent digital solutions include: Smartmoney - a robo-adviser integrated into home banking; and TIME MAP, a financial planning model which aims to include human and digital approaches, assisting customers in their financial decision making, while also taking on board regulatory requirements. More than 600,000 customers have so far used this service.</p><p>Rather than backing the recently formed digital-only fintechs, Mr Allende believes \"older\" banks can use their history, extensive branch networks and in-depth knowledge of customers across cycles to gain advantage. \"All this is crucial for the development of digital models,\" he says. YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, CEE KOMERCN\u00cd BANKA, A.S.</p><p>Komercn\u00ed banka (KB), part of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale group, admits that its digital transformation is a work in progress. The Czech bank is developing a multi-channel business model. Personal relationships between clients and t advisers remain an important pillar, but the bank is expanding the number of ways in which its customers can choose to interact with it.</p><p>Mobile banking is currently the fastest growing distribution channel. The bank launched its mobile app for retail clients in 2011, and expanded it to include businesses in 2015. \"Adding and removing features to both apps is a never ending and continuous process,\" says Jan Vichr, distribution channels and direct marketing manager at KB. Recent innovations include the introduction of payments by mobile device using the Android Pay application and allowing clients to access the app through biometric data.</p><p>KB was also the first bank in the Czech Republic to launch a banking application for Apple Watches, and has extended this to Wear OS, with users in the \"thousands\" and \"hundreds\" for the two respectively.</p><p>The bank is also looking to take advantage of the AI revolution. So far, two chatbots have been created and successfully tested. \"We think there are some cases where it makes sense to implement a chatbot solution,\" says Mr Vichr.</p><p>But the process is not easy. \"Where AI is involved, it takes time and a lot of effort to train a chatbot so that it provides useful results.\" ES BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, ASIA; BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITALLY EMPOWERING RMs, ASIA DBS BANK In a region where big tech firms such as Alibaba and Tencent have made significant inroads into financial services, digital innovation is crucial for wealth managers to survive.</p><p>\"Being truly digital involves a complete transformation of the bank, from front to back end,\" says Patrick Dreyfuss, chief operating officer, Wealth Management Group at DBS Bank.</p><p>The digital mindset is developed not just to serve customers but is embedded into the entire organisation, and spans from \"thinking of ecosystem partnerships, to transforming audit and credit processes\" through better use of data to optimise operations.</p><p>\"Through increased automation, we have been able to increase our release cadence of new applications enabling us to constantly learn, test and iterate - the same way big tech does,\" says Mr Dreyfuss.</p><p>Since 2009, the bank has insourced 85 per cent of technology, hardware, data centres, network management and app development. \"In order to be more digital, it is imperative that we own our technology resources. This has made a tremendous impact on how we approach technology\u2026 and how we innovate.\"</p><p>Being digital \"to the core\" also means being able to attract the \"brightest and most talented technology resources\". The Asian bank has established partnerships with fintechs, while making sure to embrace the way the best tech companies operate. \"Tech firms do not have the monopoly of embracing start-up culture,\" believes Mr Dreyfuss.</p><p>The bank has embedded digital KPIs into the scorecards of every employee, having gathered evidence that digitally-engaged customers bring in \"significantly more revenue\" than customers who bank in a traditional way.</p><p>DBS iWealth, the bank's all-in-one digital wealth platform, allows clients to perform their banking transactions, manage their wealth and invest, and has a comprehensive set of features and functionality. DBS's RM Mobility platform enhances relationship managers' service levels, from client prospecting and acquisition through to portfolio management and relationship building. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, NORTH AMERICA NORTHERN TRUST At Northern Trust, technology is central to its ability to provide holistic advice. As a company, it spent $2.5bn on technology between 2015 and 2017, of which a significant portion was invested to support the wealth management business.</p><p>Its goals-driven wealth management offering best illustrates how the institution makes use of technology. Over the past three years, assets under management in this programme have increased by roughly 200 per cent.</p><p>At the core of the approach is the proprietary Goals Powered Solutions (GPS) platform, which utilises algorithms, and a mobile app, designed to optimise conversations between clients and advisers through interactive visuals.</p><p>The solution \"features simplification, visualisation, quantification and integration of a holistic view of the client's total financial picture and the organisation of that information in the context of the client's goals and objectives,\" explains Steve Fradkin, president of Wealth Management at Northern Trust. And it has resulted in \"materially higher client satisfaction metrics\u2026 and improved efficiency and confidence amongst our advisers,\" he adds. More than 90 per cent of advisers use the platform.</p><p>The bank is currently 'beta testing' how to include estate and wealth transfer planning and other holistic financial considerations within its goals-based framework.</p><p>Digital engagement on the client portal 'private passport', since last year also available on Apple Watch, has greatly increased as well. Users can access self-service capabilities, including balance inquiries, transaction history, and document handling across different channels. New client-focused features are being developed, including personalised summaries based on client preferences and one-touch access to the relationship team.</p><p>Client engagement through social media and virtual live events has largely improved. Last year, social media post impressions were almost 500 per cent higher than the highest level in 2016, thanks also to a thought leadership programme developed around helping clients understand the US new tax reform legislation.</p><p>Hiring the right mix of people to drive forward the digitalisation initiatives is key.</p><p>\"The talent Northern Trust has assembled around our digitalisation efforts features inhouse and external expertise, people with strong digital backgrounds and those with other, very diversified interests and experiences,\" says Mr Fradkin. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, AFRICA INVESTEC Meeting the demand of increasingly mobile and international high net worth investors is a key priority for private banks. At Investec, the South African bank and asset manager - which also serves clients in the UK and Europe, and in Asia and Australia - every client has access to a specialist private banker and investment manager, as well as digital or \"high tech\" channels, which contribute to reach this goal.</p><p>\"In a complex financial world, we make it easy for our clients to get local and international banking and investment exposure,\" claims Lyndon Subroyen, global head of Investec Digital.</p><p>\"Our high-tech channels, Investec Online and our app, enable our clients to get a consolidated view of their banking and investment accounts, locally and internationally, on one platform with one login. They can transact easily from anywhere in the world,\" he states.</p><p>Through the online platform, accessible securely through the app, clients can manage their finances, held both with Investec and third parties, and choose between self-directed or assisted investment options, but also simplify their administrative chores, such as getting alerts when their passport is reaching its expiry date.</p><p>Through the Youth Account app, parents can teach their children about banking and the value of money and saving, while My Will provides clients with a template to draw up and save their will, allowing them with a few clicks to get in touch with a specialist attorney firm, if needed.</p><p>The bank, which runs an annual hackathon in Johannesburg and London, designed to \"accelerate business and digital innovation\", registered an almost 50 per cent increase in AuM on its online investment platform since last year, while Investec app logins increased by 33 per cent, with the number of logins equally split between Investec Online and the app. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, ROBOADVISORY, EUROPE DANSKE BANK The new robo-advisory investment platform, June, as well as digital client onboarding, both launched last year, significantly contributed to boost inflows and attract new customers at Danske Bank.</p><p>\"We wanted to democratise investments and make investing accessible for everyone in an easy, low-cost and transparent way,\" says Sune Worm Mortensen, global head of Wealth Advice at the Nordic bank.</p><p>A first mover in the Danish market through this automated investment tool, the bank was able to attract more than 15,000 new clients, most of which were first-time investors, mainly in the retail segment. Proving particularly appealing to millennials, the platform builds an appropriate balanced portfolio based on the client risk profile using ETFs, although index products are also being considered.</p><p>\"People have a tendency to consider their money in different 'buckets' for different goals and purposes,\" says Mr Mortensen. Roboadvisory has comparatively low costs, and caters well for buckets involving in-and outflow of money over time, such as dormant deposits, he adds. \"I think we'll see increasing use of robo-advice in the future, but a personal adviser will remain important for more complex buckets.\"</p><p>The bank has also continued to improve its advisory platform used by private bankers to better serve wealthy individuals.</p><p>\"The key benefit of Wealth Planner is offering goal-based, holistic advice to clients, as opposed to product-driven advice,\" he explains. The tool uses algorithms which - taking into account the client's entire financial situation, including investments, real estate, income and expenses, tax and company data - generate a post-tax, financial overview, also estimating the probability for the client of successfully achieving their goals. 'What if' scenarios allow the making of adjustments to variables such as investments, expected retirement age or purchasing properties.</p><p>The bank is currently \"experimenting\" with allowing clients to use the platform by themselves. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, ROBOADVISORY, CEE UNICREDIT Thanks to a new wealth management 'robo' solution for advisers, Unique, available in six CEE countries, UniCredit's private bankers \"are able to analyse in a few clicks the behaviour of a client portfolio, understand gaps, perform optimisation analysis and generate automated rebalancing proposals suitable for their clients,\" explains Daniela Croitoru, head of CEE Private Banking.</p><p>The aim, she adds, is to offer tailored investment solutions, supported by digital automation, monitoring and alerting, while offering advisers more time with their clients, helping them strengthen their relationship.</p><p>Developed together with a large external IT company, the platform is now used by all private bankers. While younger advisers are \"perhaps more open to using the more sophisticated areas of this tool\", feedback is collected regularly from all advisers to improve the user experience and make the tool as easy to use as possible for all, states Ms Croitoru.</p><p>The platform is soon to be made available on mobile devices, allowing clients to view their portfolios and make simple transactions, while supported by the private banker through an automated client chatbox. This will further free up advisers' time, enabling them to focus on clients' more sophisticated needs.</p><p>A web-based platform building bespoke structured products has proven successful with both bankers and clients, since its launch in 2015 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. \"Structured products are very popular in the CEE Private Banking perimeter, especially in the Czech Republic,\" she says. Through this tool, advisers are able to illustrate to clients the correlation between coupon and risk associated with a particular product, and explain complex investment solutions, while ensuring that risks match their risk profile.</p><p>\"The combination of product tailoring, education and high demand for structured products is what convinced us to implement MyOneMarkets,\" she states. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, ROBOADVISORY, ASIA KEB HANA BANK KEB Hana, the largest private bank in Korea, was an early proponent of robo-advice services. Early versions were opened in 2013 and 2015, and then in July 2017 the bank launched its HAI Robo platform - the Hana Artificial Intelligence Robo Advisor. The platform evaluates clients' risk-return profiles and recommends model portfolios, before allowing clients to execute investment decisions and monitor portfolio performance.</p><p>By March 2018 assets under management had reached $500m, with 40,000 subscribers, 5 per cent of them new customers for the bank.</p><p>\"Sixty per cent of users have subscription amount less than $1,000,\" reports Jean Hong, senior manager in the private banking business department at KEB Hana, \"and this statistics implies that young customers with few assets also need the asset management service which private banking typically provides.\"</p><p>Around 70 per cent of users are aged between 30 and 50, though 8 per cent are in their seventies.</p><p>The bank now plans to incorporate an interactive AI platform in the form of a chatbot, though Ms Hong does not foresee a time where AI algorithms replace human advisers, unless it is in the distant future, as they do not have the \"sophisticated complexity\" that humans do.</p><p>\"Current AI algorithms cannot consider the big picture including various financial issues such as tax saving, investment goals, or any other qualitative factors,\" she says.</p><p>\"Considering these limitations, how best to develop a 'hybrid' private banking model which maximises synergy between 'human' private bankers and AI-based robo-advisers will be the most important issue for the market.\" ES BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ASIA BEST PRIVATE BANK, BIG DATA AND AI, GLOBAL CREDIT SUISSE Technology innovations such as a client-facing digital platform, which generated significant trading revenues last year, certainly contributed to Credit Suisse Private Banking's strong financial results in Asia-Pacific. Net new assets sourced from the region grew by 24 per cent to SF16.9bn ($17.1bn), bringing AuM to SF197bn at the end of 2017.</p><p>\"We look at technology as a tool that we use for the benefit of our clients and our shareholders,\" states Laura Barrowman, chief technology officer at the global bank.</p><p>The institution works closely with fintech companies, such as Singapore-based Canopy, which provides asset aggregation services for clients across institutions, geographies and asset classes, and also engages with \"broader innovation ecosystem players\", such as venture capital firms and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Ms Barrowman is particularly proud of how automation allows processes to become more effective and resilient, thus reducing operational risks and saving costs. \"Taking automation to the next level involves marrying the robot with AI to make the robot more and more independent,\" adds Ms Barrowman.</p><p>The bank's service desk cognitive agent, Amelia, is \"digitally transforming\" the way clients receive support. The bank purchased the basic structure and functions of the AI platform from a technology firm. The in-house team used machine learning, psychology models and AI techniques to further build and develop Amelia's 'brain', teaching her to understand what people are saying, diagnose problems and decide whether she can fix them - and if not, hand them over to a human colleague.</p><p>Leveraging big data and deep learning technology, Credit Suisse has also developed an inhouse platform to manage eCommunications surveillance. The big data solution processes millions of ecommunications daily and, using advanced analytics, uncovers signals that meet specific criteria on financial misconduct and suspicious behaviour. Supervisors and compliance officers are notified of suspicious or anomalous activity via an alert dashboard. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, AUSTRALASIA ANZ PRIVATE - NEW ZEALAND Listening to what clients want sits at the core of improving digital communication, says Ben Kelleher, head of the largest private bank in New Zealand, with $NZ17.4bn ($12bn) in client assets. \"Our clients are increasingly time poor, and we've placed increased emphasis on keeping our communications timely, easy to understand and delivered in bite-size chunks.\" The aim is to use technology to enhance relationships and improve private bankers' efficiency. \"We have used technology to streamline our internal processes so that our bankers spend more time face-to-face helping our clients, and less time in the office dealing with administration,\" he says.</p><p>While timely news flashes have received \"amazing readership and great client feed-back\", the new 'banker workbench' tool, launched in 2017, provides bankers with a single user interface, freeing them from having to logon on to a dozen different systems.</p><p>New iPad tools have enriched their conversations with clients. The 'projection app' allows advisers to explore different scenarios and options with clients, based on their specific goals and situation, while the 'easy app' speeds up and simplifies the lending process for housing or commercial property.</p><p>Changing people's mindset is a huge priority across the ANZ Group, claims Mr Kelleher. \"We have coined 'new ways of working' across our organisation, where the focus is on agile thinking and delivery.\"</p><p>One of the most important competitive advantages for a firm is to be able to adapt and react quickly to change, he explains. \"We are working to ensure we build an organisation that is at the front of that curve; constantly adapting and improving our services for our clients.\" ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, BIG DATA AND AI, ASIA TAISHIN BANK Utilising data is an important component of Taishin Bank's strategy to attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing customers. \"In order to provide the service which customers want, we not only use traditional data such as transaction history, location and product consumption, but have built a brand new system called 'Tagging',\" explains Christy Shyy, head of the Segmentation Division, at Taishin International Bank.</p><p>The Tagging system analyses dynamic data such as a customer's character, behaviour and preferences in order to build up a more detailed picture of these clients. The Taiwan-based bank created more than 1,500 labels and assigns these to customers, averaging about 15 per individual, although some are attributed far more. Client behaviour is rapidly shifting as a result of digitalisation, and it is vital for banks to collect the correct data, then be able to analyse and apply that efficiently in order to meet these changing needs, says Ms Shyy. \"We must ensure changes in customer behaviour can be immediately reflected in customer observation data. Only then can we effectively and quickly leverage the value of the data transition to provide satisfying customer experiences.\"</p><p>Banks are now able to access much more than the traditional in-branch transaction data they used to collect. External data sources such as government-provided open data and industry data are one pipeline, though unstructured voice and text data, such as call centre records and interviews between financial advisers and customers are also available.</p><p>But is it not easy to put that data to use. \"Data is now more diverse than ever, but is generated by different systems and scattered across different storage locations,\" she says. \"Mining valuable information for use out of open data is also a challenge.\"</p><p>Taishin is therefore searching for ever-more consistent ways to combine bank data with external data sources in order to improve the accuracy of customer behaviour data, thereby improving the client <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.experience.ES\">www.experience.ES</url> BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITALLY EMPOWERING RMs, GLOBAL CITI PRIVATE BANK With a goal of enhancing the advisory process, Citi has deployed a big data analytics platform, which gives relationship managers (RMs) the ability to monitor their client's past, current and future investment activities, including asset allocation gaps and opportunities, upcoming maturities and cash flows. It allows them to quickly drill down and identify what matters most to which client, based on news and views, explains Philip Watson, chief innovation officer for the private bank in Emea and Global Investments.</p><p>Machine learning, integrated into the platform, helps anticipate the types of solutions which may be of most interest to specific individuals. \"The platform helps our RMs cut to the chase and channel advice to clients in a way that is more timely, relevant and actionable.\"</p><p>Similarly, Citi's Global Theme Machine helps RMs determine which companies globally will provide investors with the best exposure to a specific and attractive theme.</p><p>The Outlook Watchlist translates the house view into recommendations for each client, highlighting how their portfolio is positioned thematically, and identifies divergences in exposure. This way, investors can improve the risk-adjusted return of their investment portfolios and address gaps or opportunities. The positive feedback has been overwhelming, reports Mr Watson. \"Many clients have seen the Watchlist as a real game-changer in how they assess their investments portfolios in the context of investment themes.\"</p><p>These innovations have provided \"a clearer linkage\" between client portfolios, market events, the house views and the investment opportunities on the bank's platform.</p><p>Private banks can be inspired by other industries in the use of technology, states Mr Watson. Augmented and virtual reality, for example, now enables buyers and sellers to experience overseas property without having to travel physically to the location, and such artificial digital environment could significantly enhance how private bankers provide advice.</p><p>\"It isn't about building a platform of gadgets and widgets\u2026digitalisation should be used to support the client experience along all aspects of their journey.\" ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITALLY EMPOWERING RMs, EUROPE LOMBARD ODIER For the past 25 years, Lombard Odier, the independently-owned Swiss private bank, has made investments to create a \"single, global banking platform\" to deliver tailored solutions meeting clients' goals.</p><p>\"Our system is all about adding power to human relationships,\" says Francesco Di Lella, co-head of front office IT development at the bank. On one level, it is about making life easier for relationship managers, he adds.</p><p>For example, the system determines which investment ideas match the client's personal interests, tax profile and financial knowledge. The relationship manager can then select the ones to propose to the client via the client digital interface, My LO.</p><p>\"The technology creates a straight line from our senior investment professionals and into our clients' smartphones and laptops.\"</p><p>The system has built-in risk controls, running pre-and post-compliance checks on trades. Checks based on individual clients' specifications can also be configured.</p><p>Through My LO, clients can access a secure messaging link which enables direct, real time communication with their bankers, and also gain a granular overview of their portfolio. \"We believe that this combination of knowledge and interactivity is how wealth managers can use technology innovation to deliver genuinely bespoke wealth management,\" says Mr Di Lella.</p><p>The bank, whose technology and operations division employs more than 600 people, also offers its proprietary banking platform to third-party banking groups. This helps make its technology \"self-financing\". Nine external banks currently use the bank's solutions. Over the past year, the institution has signed partnership agreements with three new banks in Switzerland, France and Luxembourg, and built \"a second hub\" in the Grand Duchy to complement its base in Geneva. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITALLY EMPOWERING RMs, LATAM SANTANDER PRIVATE BANKING Santander Private Banking firmly believes in a client model that is 'human-led, technology enabled'. \"It is true clients are demanding more digital options, yet many still see their banker as their connection to Santander,\" says Felipe Chinarro, responsible for Banker's tools and databases, in the Wealth Management division.</p><p>The bank has developed a multi-device, multilingual, modular and integrated tool and launched it in a number of countries, the aim being that when bankers meet with customers outside the office, they can \"take the bank\" along with them, allowing them to have all relevant information readily available. The tool provides, for example investment proposals adjusted to a client's investment profile and integrated customer information, while allowing managers to view bankers' schedules and assist them in arranging meetings.</p><p>\"The bankers really enjoy working with the technology,\" he reports. \"It supports better, well informed client meetings and helps reduce the administrative burden. It's also similar to what bankers are using in their personal lives so they've really embraced it.\"</p><p>Santander claims the tool has seen administrative processes reduced by 20 per cent and enabled more, and better-prepared client meetings, resulting in 10 per cent more investment proposals being accepted.</p><p>Tools such as these are there to make a banker's job easier and more productive, insists Mr Chinarro, and are not about replacing humans with machines.</p><p>\"There are a number of industry commentators who try to make us believe that digital tools are here to take banker's jobs. In our case, it's the opposite,\" he says. \"We must remember that great relationships are built on 'trust', and trust is a deeply human instinct. Santander recognises this and so we continue to recruit the best talent.\" ES BEST PRIVATE BANK, REGTECH, GLOBAL UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT \"Delivering regulatory compliance with the support of technology has been one of our focus work areas and thus also one of our investment priorities for many years,\" states Jonathan Shih, head of Financial Crime at UBS Group. This is evidenced by investments of more than SF3.5bn ($3.5bn) made at the global bank to implement regulations over the past five years.</p><p>With the rise of more creative, yet also more robust solutions provided by start-ups in the regtech space, the potential for banks and startups to partner in solving challenges has increased exponentially, says Mr Shih. With the help of technology and process improvements, such collaborations look at generating creative approaches to address existing and new challenges, for example in digital identity, onboard-ing, ongoing client due diligence and KYC data, as well as processes or anti-money-laundering and fraud protection.</p><p>While optimisation and digitalisation of processes around GDPR and MiFID are seen as a given, UBS has also launched initiatives looking at future market opportunities. An example is the digital wealth passport, delivered as proof of concept (PoC) in collaboration with start-up Tradle, on their blockchain-enabled platform. It offers clients a secure digital passport or digital identity, capturing KYC information and certified documents.</p><p>The key benefits for clients are that they truly own their data, can choose with whom to share it and re-use it. That includes, but is not limited to, easily requesting data that is stored with partners they own, explains Martin Hartenstein, head of Strategy and Business Transformation, GWM Omnichannel Management, UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>For UBS' advisers - but also for the client's other service providers, such as banks, lawyers and business partners or even utility providers - it means optimising onboarding and ongoing due diligence.</p><p>\"It also prepare advisers for future regulation, but also service expectations from more and more data privacy attuned clients, who demand control of their data,\" claims Ms Hartenstein.</p><p>Internal research revealed that clients see UBS as a \"trusted\" financial partner which through the digital wealth passport or similar solutions, may also be \"the guardian\" of their data, he adds. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, GLOBAL BBVA PRIVATE BANKING Of all the digital initiatives taken to improve client communication, Jorge Gordo, BBVA Private Banking director, is particularly proud of those which \"empower\" customers, allowing them to better manage and monitor their financial and non-financial assets, throughout their life cycle.</p><p>Such initiatives are based on the bank's philosophy that the more clients know, the better they decide, and this creates new opportunities.</p><p>Through a variety of digital tools, clients can receive personalised advice based on their goals and risk profile, define their most suitable wealth strategy, including succession planning and wealth transfer, and track the performance of their investments, held with BBVA and third parties. They can also monitor real estate portfolios and track property expenses, plan personal finances around the arrival of a baby, and receive up to date information on markets.</p><p>Several services have also been introduced to enhance clients' daily experience with the bank. Clients can now sign contracts remotely, hold conversations and exchange documents with private bankers in a secure environment. They can also book appointments instantly, receive alerts, and access online reporting.</p><p>Enhancing the capabilities of private bankers is a \"key priority\" for the bank, and all relationship managers have been equipped with a dedicated tablet, with apps and functionalities which enable them to work on the move.</p><p>While digital experts are mostly employed by the group, keen to share know-how and expertise, the bank has also established joint ventures with fintech companies and also acquired some.</p><p>Looking to the future, big data and AI are believed to have great growth potential in private banking. \"Big data and AI can improve how we advise our clients and help them take the best investment decisions,\" says Mr Gordo, explaining they are working on new tools to optimise customers' investments, risks, financial behaviour, income and expenses. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, NORTH AMERICA RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT RBC Wealth Management, the Canadian bank with C$634bn ($495bn) of assets under management globally, is making significant investmentsindigitalanddatacapabilitiestoenhance the way advisers interact with and deliver services to clients.</p><p>\"We're building a digitally enabled relationship bank,\" states Terri-Lee Weeks, senior vicepresident, Products and Strategy. \"We focus on simplifying everyday client needs as well as adapting our service models to fit our clients' preferences.\" Improving access to information and interaction across channels, and allowing advisers to engage the client through more \"personalised, timely and actionable insights\" will ultimately drive a greater client relationship stickiness and loyalty, she adds.</p><p>Core to this vision is the AVA application (Adviser's Virtual Assistant) launched in North America in 2017, which enables advisers to better anticipate and address client needs.</p><p>\"AVA provides our advisers with real-time access to critical client insights and the information they need to be more productive while they are on the go,\" she explains, while clients are able to make more informed decisions. The application is very popular among advisers, and is currently being used by more than 2,600 of them across Canada and the US. \"We think it is a strong complement to the human element of wealth management.\"</p><p>In the US, the bank launched a client-facing app, providing clients with access to their portfolios, daily updates on positions, balances and performance, and also allowing for digital cheque deposit.</p><p>Progress has been made in big data analytics and AI. Last year RBC's International Wealth Management business launched an \"exploratory artificial intelligence bot\" to digest and extract key insights from market information, aimed at augmenting sales and relationship management activities, while allowing cost sav-ing. The full scale of the bot's capability is estimated to be equivalent to 50 full time market intelligence analysts, who analyse publicly available data to build client profile and source contact information. ET BEST INITIATIVE, CLIENTFACING TECH, GLOBAL COUTTS UK bank Coutts has recently launched a digital networking site, Coutts Connect, designed exclusively for its clients, extending the reach of the Coutts Investment Club, an introduction-only, non-advised service, which connects clients with private company investment opportunities.</p><p>\"Coutts Connect enables us to add another dimension to our customer service and helps build brand loyalty,\" explains Elisha Jones, digital platform manager at the bank.</p><p>Traditionally, clients have been able to build and expand their networks through the bank's events and introductions made by their relationship manager. \"Now, with Coutts Connect, clients have a smart and convenient way to connect directly with other clients and are no longer contingent on their relationship manager or a face-to-face event.\"</p><p>Clients link from their LinkedIn account to set up their profile, while AI and matching algorithms help drive relevant and meaningful interactions.</p><p>Users, representative of the bank's client base, including entrepreneurs, company directors and are UK-based, can invite other members to their event, advertise job positions, seek advice or share ideas. They experience higher quality responses than other social network sites, due to the level of expertise and experience of the user base, while also benefiting from privacy and discretion, reports Ms Jones.</p><p>\"There is also a common purpose to help each other's businesses be successful, by working together and sharing knowledge.\"</p><p>The bank's digital team does not prescreen content before it is published, but it monitors content daily to ensure it does not contravene the site's terms of use, such as illegal activity or offensive language.</p><p>\"We do not use the content shared on the platform to drive any marketing, however it may be used by relationship managers to validate what they know about their clients and therefore help drive meaningful conversations,\" points out Ms Jones.</p><p>The bank regularly seeks user feedback and works with its technology partner ProFinda to enhance the user experience of the platform.</p><p>\"One of the biggest enhancements we want to make in the next couple of years is to bring Coutts Connect under a single login for all Coutts digital services,\" she adds. ET BEST INITIATIVE, CLIENTFACING TECH, EUROPE ABN AMRO PRIVATE BANKING Dutch bank ABN AMRO, which boasts a strong presence across Europe, launched a digital wealth and investment management platform last year in Germany, Prospery, which gives clients an overview of their finances and investments, including those held with third-party banks, and facilitates goal planning. Far from being a purely algorithm-based solution, it combines 'personal coaching' by financial experts, through chat or video call.</p><p>Meanwhile, payment app Tikkie, which allows consumers to send payment requests via WhatsApp was launched two years ago in the Netherlands, and a digital service model, Next, was developed specifically to cater to millennials. It includes financial coaching via Webex, WhatsApp and email, as well as access to e-learning and events.</p><p>New initiatives in digital communication include video conferencing and a private-banking call centre offering remote advice, as well as live webinars, weblogs and videos. In France, the institution introduced a mobile daily-banking payment app.</p><p>\"In private banking, you need digitalisation in combination with a personal touch to make the difference,\" says Pieter van Mierlo, CEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking. \"Clients appreciate the quality of interactions, knowledge and relevance of our client service teams, as well as our efforts to be more modern, including new websites, portals and apps. Clients, especially the younger generation, expect us to continue to innovate.\"</p><p>Aiming to add value through data-driven solutions, the bank is preparing to launch an app to allow advisers to have \"more valuable and proactive contact with clients\". In addition, a modelling solution will identify which clients are more likely to leave the bank, enabling advisers' timely interventions.</p><p>While the group's retail bank proved innovative with its new web-cam advisory service, other industries are certainly inspirational, when it comes to digitalisation and use of technology, says Mr Mierlo. \"We can learn from bigtechs like Google. Their success with machine learning is admirable. We also work with fintechs because they have innovative ideas and work fast,\" he states. He also cites Spotify for its \"agile way of working\", and Amazon and Netflix for their ability to \"personalise client contact\". ET BEST INITIATIVE, CLIENTFACING TECH, CEE TATRA BANKA Slovakia's Tatra banka recently launched a new fully digital advisory tool for private bankers, covering all asset classes, including alternatives, to improve the quality of advice offered to clients.</p><p>The platform, which takes on board MiFID regulatory requirements, allows an overall view of all assets and investments, enabling advisers to better prepare client meetings and make simulations of investment proposals. The digital signature allows a paperless process, with transactions sent to the order routing systems directly.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge in the implementation phase was to connect this platform to our bank system,\" acknowledges Marek Neck\u00e1r, head of private banking, Tatra banka, Slovakia. A client portal, giving clients access to their portfolios and investments is currently being developed.</p><p>While the institution has used voice biometrics since 2013, biometrics facial recognition was launched last year and recently implemented, enabling clients to securely open a bank account and use it immediately.</p><p>To meet client demand for alternative investments, Tatra offers HNW investors the opportunity to invest in start-ups, selected by Slovakan investment service firm Crowdberry, through an equity crowdfunding platform.</p><p>A MobilePay app allows contactless payments by smartphone, while the Tatra banka app, compatible with smartwatches, allows clients to check money transfers and account balance, and withdraw money via their phones. ET BEST INITIATIVE, RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT TECH, GLOBAL STANDARD CHARTERED PRIVATE BANK In 2017, Standard Chartered Private Bank launched Advice, a solution which aims to improve the client experience by enhancing its advisory proposition and reducing turnaround time of the investment process. The tool delivers the bank's investment ideas, conviction product solutions and advisory models to its frontline bankers and is now used by all the bank's 400 relationship managers and investment advisers across Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE and the UK.</p><p>\"The introduction of Advice has drastically reduced the amount of time our relationship managers and investment advisers need to prepare each client's investment portfolio, by up to 50 per cent,\" states Alexis Calla, global head, Investment Advisory and Strategy at the bank.</p><p>Before, advisers had to reference several different sources to generate a relevant investment idea with the necessary rationales, and conduct suitability and compliance checks. This \"one-stop\" platform delivers investment ideas alongside latest market movements, enhanced with real-time data from Thomson Reuters Eikon.</p><p>\"Advice allows us to combine the speed of delivery through digital with the relevance and personalisation from the human interaction,\" says Mr Calla, explaining that the human \"touch\" is preferred by clients, especially when having to make bigger investment decisions.</p><p>The main challenge of implementing a platform of this scale, with Advice available in four of the bank's advisory booking centres, is the \"sheer number of teams involved in the process\". This spanned from legal, compliance and advisory, to the technology powering the application and various product owners who decided what information would be made available on Advice.</p><p>\"What was crucial to our success was a common understanding established to focus on quickly putting out a minimum viable product, and then gathering feedback from the intended users for further iterations,\" he explains.</p><p>To respond to client enquiries around stocks outside the \"comprehensive\" range of asset classes and individual securities covered by Advice, within its conviction list, the bank has initiated a proof-of-concept (POC) with a robo-advisory fintech. This is designed to provide live views on stocks within a defined universe, in addition to generating automated talking points to highlight the key drivers and risks to each view.

Greater competition could even lead to tech companies paying people for their data, the report for the Treasury says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators are struggling to keep up with digital companies, and while the industry has transformed lives in positive ways the report identifies \"substantial costs\" from the monopolies of the biggest businesses.</p><p>Although people benefit from free services, the lack of competition means that they may give up more privacy than they would if they had greater choice, the report says. The present \"winner-takes-most\" market conditions could impede innovation, it adds, accusing the dominant companies of using \"bullying tactics\".</p><p>The five largest US tech companies - Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft - have a combined market value of about $3.5 trillion (\u00a32.7 trillion) and have bought more than 400 smaller businesses over the past decade to entrench their control of the market.</p><p>Mr Furman's report calls for a new \"digital markets unit\" to ensure greater competition and consumer choice in the sector. This could be an independent body or one run by the Competition and Markets Authority or Ofcom.</p><p>The new regulator should draw up a code of conduct for the big tech firms, the report recommends, with existing powers for tackling illegal anticompetitive practices strengthened to make it quicker and simpler to prosecute breaches such as \"bullying tactics by market leaders\".</p><p>Under the proposals, customers would be able to send messages directly from one online platform to another, like email, and their personal data such as social media contacts would be portable, like a mobile phone number. Such changes would allow users to switch platforms easily or for rival platforms to link into existing networks.</p><p>Because the next tech revolution centres on artificial intelligence, the companies with the largest datasets are most able to take advantage of it, the authors say. To level the playing field, big companies should be forced to share datasets that could help smaller businesses to innovate without affecting customers' privacy.</p><p>Mr Furman, 48, a Harvard professor, said the proposals would \"give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies\".</p><p>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said that he would respond to the report later this year with plans for \"the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve\".</p><p>Google should be broken up, says News Corp</p><p>News Corp has called for Google to be broken up, saying its dominance of digital advertising harms consumers and publishers (writes Simon Duke).</p><p>The owner of </p><p>                   The Times                    </p><p>told an Australian inquiry into digital platforms that Google should have to hive off its search engine from its other business. It controlled every point in the complex system that enabled adverts to be placed on devices, allowing it to \"dictate\" prices, and its dominance undermined publishers' ability to fund journalism, which \"strikes at the heart of our system of democracy\", the company said.</p><p>News Corp also owns</p><p>                    The Sunday Times                   </p><p>, </p><p>                   The Sun,                   </p><p>                   The Wall Street Journal                    </p><p>and the biggest newspaper publisher in Australia. Robert Thomson, its chief executive, previously called for curbs on Google, Facebook and other platforms.</p><p>In December Australia's competition watchdog said that a regulatory body should be created to oversee the global digital giants but stopped short of calling for break-ups.</p><p>News Corp said: \"Google leverages its market power in both general search services and ad tech services to the detriment of consumers, advertisers and news publishers. Google could either sell Google Search or retain Google Search and divest the rest of its businesses to a third party.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52538349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-FHR1-F021-6139-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

America ranks 15th in the world in access to high-speed Internet connections.</p><p>A cornerstone of Obama's agenda is promoting universal, affordable high-speed Internet access.</p><p>Obama, who had notable success with online fundraising and voter turnout, spoke during the presidential campaign about the transformative power of the Internet to improve Americans' quality of life. He argued that it could, among other things, reduce health care costs, create jobs and make it easier for citizens to participate in government decision-making.</p><p>In a speech this month about his economic stimulus plan, he said that he intends to ensure that every child has a chance to get online and that he would use some of the stimulus money to connect libraries and schools. It is a critical goal. Children trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide are deprived of a fair chance to educate themselves and to compete for high-skill, high-paying jobs.</p><p>Obama has also been a strong supporter of ''network neutrality,'' the principle that Internet service providers should not be able to discriminate against any of the information that they carry. Net neutrality laws are necessary to ensure that Internet service providers do not block content they disagree with or give financial breaks to big tech companies, squeezing out smaller competitors and stifling innovation.</p><p>Obama will need to work with Congress - and fight against corporate lobbyists - to accomplish some of his goals. Some he can achieve on his own. With the right appointments to the Federal Communications Commission, he should be able to get good net neutrality regulations.</p><p>''This is the Eisenhower Interstate highway moment for the Internet,'' argues Ben Scott, policy director of the media reform group Free Press.

Die Datenschutzgrundverordnung ist ein Erfolg und ein Vorbild, aber sie hat gleichzeitig noch viele Baustellen.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Von           </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Als die EU-Datenschutz-Grundverordnung am 25. Mai 2018 in Kraft trat, waren Skepsis und Unbehagen im Markt, aber auch bei den betroffenen Verbrauchern gro\u00df. Keine Seite sah ihre Erwartungen an diese zukunftsweisende Verordnung erf\u00fcllt.</p><p>Vor allem Fragen rund um die konkrete Ausgestaltung, die Umsetzung des umfangreichen Regelwerks sowie die Furcht vor horrenden Bu\u00dfgeldern im Falle m\u00f6glicher Verfehlungen besch\u00e4ftigten die Unternehmen in den damals 28 Mitgliedsstaaten. Heute k\u00f6nnen wir durchaus feststellen, dass die DSGVO ihre wesentlichen Ziele im Grunde erf\u00fcllen konnte.</p><p>Im Falle von \u00d6ffnungsklauseln wurden die Datenschutzgesetzgebungen der Mitgliedstaaten harmonisiert, der Schutz und die Rechte der Nutzer digitaler Dienste gest\u00e4rkt und international operierenden Unternehmen Leitlinien an die Hand gegeben, wie sie mit welchen Daten umgehen sollen. Europa wurde zum Vorreiter in Sachen Datenschutz und Privatsph\u00e4re, die DSGVO zur Erfolgsgeschichte und zum Rollenmodell f\u00fcr andere M\u00e4rkte. Allerdings mit Einschr\u00e4nkungen.</p><h>       Work in Progress     </h><p>Die DSGVO ist n\u00e4mlich auch, was man im anglophonen Raum als \"Work in Progress\" bezeichnen w\u00fcrde. Viele ihrer Baustellen wurden bis heute nicht geschlossen. So konnten sich etwa die Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rden in Europa noch immer nicht einigen, wie die DSGVO im Einzelfall zu implementieren ist. Als Beispiel sei hier das Thema \u201aEinholung der Zustimmung f\u00fcr das Setzen von Cookies\" und die damit verbundene Ausgestaltung von Cookie-Bannern genannt. Dies ist einer der Gr\u00fcnde, warum europ\u00e4ische Unternehmen auch zwei Jahre nach Inkrafttreten der DSGVO in Bezug auf ihr Gesch\u00e4ft und ihre strategische Ausrichtung noch immer verunsichert sind.</p><p>Auch sehen wir einen unbeabsichtigten Nebeneffekt der DSGVO. Sollte die Verordnung unter anderem auch die gro\u00dfen amerikanischen Big Tech regulatorisch in ihre Schranken verweisen, scheinen diese nach heutigem Kenntnisstand eher noch einen Wettbewerbsvorteil gegen\u00fcber EU-Unternehmen daraus zu ziehen.</p><h>       Kontrolle funktioniert nicht     </h><p>Dieses Problem verst\u00e4rkt sich dadurch, dass die nationalen Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rden immer noch nicht personell so gut aufgestellt sind, dass sie die gro\u00dfen Plattformen entsprechend ihrer marktbeherrschenden Stellung ausreichend kontrollieren k\u00f6nnten - gerade Mitarbeiter mit technischem Hintergrund, die im Detail die Datengewinnung und Datenverarbeitung nachvollziehen k\u00f6nnen, gibt es oft nicht genug. Von einem gemeinsamen, europaweit koordinierten Vorgehen ganz zu schweigen.</p><p>Im Sinne der europ\u00e4ischen Wirtschaft w\u00e4re eine europaweit harmonisierte Umsetzung der DSGVO dringend w\u00fcnschenswert, inklusive einer konsistenten und koordinierten Umsetzung speziell auch mit Blick auf die gro\u00dfen Plattformen. Ohne eine vorherige wirtschaftliche Folgenabsch\u00e4tzung riskieren wir, dass europ\u00e4ische Publisher und Werbetreibende bei neuen regulatorischen Verordnungen wiederum benachteiligt werden.</p><p>In dieser Hinsicht sollte die EU den aktuellen Entwurf der E-Privacy-Verordnung nochmals pr\u00fcfen und vor allem mit der DSGVO in Einklang bringen. Denn dann k\u00f6nnen wir auch ohne Einschr\u00e4nkungen von einer Erfolgsgeschichte DSGVO sprechen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Autor:</emphasis></p><p>W&amp;V Leserautor W&amp;V ist die Plattform der Kommunikationsbranche.

I'm the Head of Research for Barclays Capital. I want to welcome everybody here to the lunch at our eighth annual financial services conference.</p><p>I'd like to introduce Bob. You probably all know Bob started Barclays Capitalin 1996 basically from scratch and he instilled a culture at the firm that persists to this day that has worked very well for everybody who's worked at the firm and has, I think, been the main reason for our success. This culture's all about meritocracy, it's all about execution and it's all about the focus on servicing our clients.</p><p>I got to Barclays in 2003. At that time, the objective was to be the best fixed income house and risk manager. We had a little over 5,000 people, I think, globally at Barclays Capital. I have to say I think at the time, most investors were pretty skeptical that we'd be able to achieve that objective. In the end, we did succeed in that objective and built top three franchises in rates and commodities and in FX.</p><p>Then, of course, we went through the financial crisis. We not only survived as one of the only major banks not to take even a dime from any government but we really thrived and acquired a first-rate global equities and banking franchise and a much bigger presence in the US with the merger with Lehman. We have a new objective and that's to be the premier global investment bank. As a Barclays employee for over eight years, I've learned to take these objectives very seriously because we're serious about them.</p><p>I would venture to say in my opinion, this integration between Barclays and Lehman will go down as the most successful integration in the history of financial services, although I'd be the first to admit that the bar is pretty low -- hasn't been a lot of great ones. You may say it was lucky Lehman landed in our laps. Surely luck plays a role in everything in financial markets -- in fact, you might say everything in life. I would remind everybody that at that time -- which was, if you all remember, mid-September 2008 -- there were no other bidders.</p><p>I'll also just tell you a very brief story about Bob, which he probably doesn't even remember. I was asked in -- I think it was 2006, to make a presentation before the Board at an off-site and I got to see the long-range plans of the firm and I was amazed how much revenue was projected for the United States. I saw Bob the next day in the office and I said, \"There's no way we can achieve that organically.\" He said, \"Right.\" So I started talking to him about possibilities, just my own ideas. He basically said, \"Too expensive. We're going to wait.\" Well, I think that was in 2006 a pretty prescient thing to say.</p><p>So I'll just end by saying that not just speaking for me as a Barclays employee but I think all the Barclays employees in the room and at large -- and I know a lot of them -- we all have tremendous confidence in Bob and the senior management team, many of which are sitting right here. We all know that this is going to be incredibly challenging -- is an incredibly challenging environment from a number of perspectives.</p><p>But I'd remind everybody, like all of these things, there are going to be winners and losers. We went through a big tech bubble. We all know plenty of technology companies that are losers and we know a few who are big winners. I'm very confident that under the leadership of Bob and Rich and Jerry from Barclays Capitalthat we're going to be one of the winners.</p><p>So with that, let me introduce Bob Diamond. Thanks.</p><p>BOB DIAMOND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, BARCLAYS PLC: I was going to let you stay up here, Larry. You're on a roll. I want to repeat your \"thank you,\" Larry, to Jason Goldberg and the financials team and to Bruce Harting who is a co-founder of this event and has now shifted gears from the research team into the investment banking [fig] team. So to Jason and Bruce and Larry, for all that you do, this is a fantastic conference and it's my honor to be here.</p><p>Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today, as I said, at the Barclays CapitalFinancial Services Conference. There are three topics that I'm going to try and cover today. I've chosen them because I recognize that our stock trades at a significant discount to our tangible equity and I do not believe that that is justified.</p><p>So I want to directly address the concerns that I know people have, concerns that have been heightened by the fact that we are operating in an environment that lacks certainty, an environment that lacks confidence. This includes lack of certainty about regulation, especially in the UK, where the Independent Commission on Banking published their final report just yesterday; lack of confidence about the eurozone and our exposures there; and concerns as to whether we will be able to hit our targeted return on equity of 13% by 2013 in the face of new regulation, challenging market conditions, and slowing economic growth.</p><p>While market conditions are challenging and I understand the concerns people have, we are confident about our position at Barclays. Let me take this opportunity to explain why, starting with regulation. The Independent Commission on Banking published its final report yesterday after 15 months of careful deliberation. This publication represents a welcome step towards the greater clarity that banks need to be able to operate with confidence. I know the major question you have is what the cost of this will be for Barclays but as you will understand, there's still a lot of work to be done here.</p><p>The report calls for changes in UK law, changes in international law and coordination with international regulation. There are many steps yet to be taken, and until we know the full details, it is difficult to quantify the impact. So let me focus instead on the key provisions of the report.</p><p>First, we welcome the ICB's recognition that the benefits of diversification in banking models should be retained, both for the good of clients and for the internal synergies that exist. As the Chancellor said, the goal has to be for Britain to be the home of successful international banks. It's important that our shareholders will continue to be able to access both retail and institutional earnings.</p><p>We also welcome the fact that the report's recommendations leave flexibility to determine the final implementation -- the final details of implementation. This allows for the definition of the ring fence to be aligned with the shape of our retail and corporate banking businesses and with the work we have already done on recovery and resolution plans. As we've already said, ring fencing is not our first choice but we believe we can make it work. Looking at the capital requirements, for example, the requirement for a core Tier 1 ratio of 10% in the ring-fenced entity was as expected. As you already know, at the half year Barclays' core Tier 1 ratio -- Barclays' core equity ratio was 11%.</p><p>The report also calls for primary loss-absorbing capital of 17% to 20%. Currently our Tier 1 and Tier 2 ratios amount to 17% and our total potential loss-absorbing capital is more than double that.</p><p>The timeline for implementation, which runs until 2019, is critical for banks to accommodate the changes while continuing to support the economy. Barclays has a very strong track record of adapting its business model to deliver for its shareholders and this timeline gives us confidence in being able to continue to do just that.</p><p>Recall that in 2008, we signalled we would get ahead of regulatory change by ensuring that we have a strong capital position. Our core Tier 1 ratio has doubled since then to 11%, our Tier 1 capital has grown to 13.5% and our total capital, including Tier 2, now stands at 17%.</p><p>One reason for this is our own ability to generate capital. Since 2008, we've generated GBP8.8 billion of equity and virtually the entire increase in our core Tier 1 ratio in the last 18 months has resulted from our underlying profit performance.</p><p>We've also reduced leverage to 20x and our surplus liquidity has increased to GBP145 billion. GBP85 billion of that pool is cash held with central banks, GBP25 billion is in UK government bonds and a further GBP24 billion is in other government bonds including Switzerland, the US, and Japan.</p><p>Despite market volatility, our funding position is very strong. We've raised GBP54 billion in term liabilities over the past 18 months and we priced a EUR2 billion three-year covered bond at 52 basis points over mid swaps as recently as August 31. So we're accessing funding cost effectively, even though the market has tightened.</p><p>Our liquidity stress tests show that even in the worst case scenario, where the wholesale markets close completely, we have a significant buffer period before taking any management action. In addition, our surplus liquidity pool covers an entire year of wholesale maturities. In short, Barclays today continues to operate with rock solid capital and rock solid liquidity.</p><p>Moving on to the eurozone, we recognize there are concerns about Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. So we have given a detailed breakdown of our assets in these markets in terms of the businesses they relate to, the nature of the risk, and how we manage that risk. To summarize, GBP44 billion of our exposure --- the majority -- relates to retail banking activities. This is almost all mortgages, mainly on first homes with low loan-to-value ratios, in Spain and Italy and in Portugal. Our corporate assets total about GBP14 billion. We took substantial provisions upfront on our corporate portfolio. Our impairment charges are now declining and we expect that to continue.</p><p>Our sovereign exposure of GBP11.6 billion is all fair valued. 70% of this is held to hedge interest rate risk relating to our local businesses. Over half of that has a remaining life of under two years and is being replaced by swaps. 30% of our sovereign exposure is in our trading and derivative portfolio, resulting from our role as a leading primary dealer, market maker and liquidity provider to our clients. The remaining assets, less than GBP7 billion, relate to financial institutions and normal interbank activity.</p><p>A significant part of this is the strong financial institutions with administrative centers in Ireland but with little Irish exposure. Keep in mind that while it is booked in Ireland, the real risk is to the strong parent company.</p><p>You'll notice that I have not mentioned Greece. Our exposure there is minimal.</p><p>In summary, our exposures in these markets are not speculative. They are largely in retail banking, they are largely secured and we're managing our risks carefully. So we're confident about the assets that we own and the values at which they're held.</p><p>Of course, confidence will not be restored until the EU sovereign debt issue is resolved. This is the most critical issue weighing on the markets right now. The opportunity for Europe is clear -- a big, deep, liquid sovereign debt market with all the safety and security characteristics of the US Treasury market, underpinning a European corporate funding market and driving economic growth. The way to achieve this is through greater fiscal integration. I believe the debate will increasingly address how and when we get there, not if we get there.</p><p>As the uncertainty continues, we remain focused on four key priorities at Barclays -- capital strength, returns, income growth and citizenship. Each of these is critical to our ability to succeed in this environment and we have a strong, experienced management team committed to executing on each and every one.</p><p>I've talked about our strong capital position, so I want to move on now to talk about returns. We set a target this February to generate a return on equity of 13% by 2013. With greater certainty, now that the ICB has published their report, we reiterate that target.</p><p>Though we're just eight months into our journey and we still have a long way to go, there are signs of good progress in our underlying numbers. Our adjusted return on equity rose to 9.1% in the first half from just below 7%. Our return on tangible equity grew to just under 11%. This was driven by a 24% profit growth in the first half, excluding PPI and own credit.</p><p>Our three world-class businesses --- Retail and Business Banking in the UK, Barclaycard and Barclays Capital--- are businesses that operate in the very top tier of their industry, businesses that have scale, have technology, have brand and have customer depth and breadth. All three delivered an adjusted return on equity above 13% in the first half this year.</p><p>As you know, we apply a core Tier 1 ratio of 10% to all of our businesses. UK Retail Banking reported a return on equity of 15%, at Barclaycard it was 16%, and Barclays Capitalgenerated a return of 15%, even in a soft trading environment. Together, these three businesses account for two thirds of our risk-weighted assets, two thirds of our capital.</p><p>In addition, we have two businesses that have the potential to become top tier, Wealth and Africa. I'll talk about these later in relation to income growth. Both show continued progress.</p><p>Then there are two businesses where we recognize that we have serious work to do, Corporate Banking and Retail and Business Banking in continental Europe. Barclays Corporate returned to profitability in the first half of this year. That is very significant improvement on the negative return last year, though clearly we still have much further to go.</p><p>Europe Retail and Business Banking was loss-making, due to the costs of restructuring that business. In particular, we are reducing headcount and the size of our branch network in Spain. The business now has strong leadership and is much better shaped for this environment. It will return to profitability in the second half and deliver positive returns going forward.</p><p>Disciplined cost management is also critical to delivering returns and will give us the flexibility to navigate the incredibly challenging market conditions. We held costs flat in the first half and expect to deliver a reduction of GBP250 million for the full year, net of restructuring. We believe we will comfortably exceed our savings target for 2013 of GBP1 billion because we are running Barclays today in a more integrated and in a more efficient way.</p><p>Our third execution priority, income growth, is also an important part of delivering returns. Though the environment has been challenging, those areas where we have been investing are beginning to deliver. At Barclays Wealth, we are in the second year of a five-year investment program. In 2010, the first year, revenues grew 18%. This year, first-half income grew 12% and we're continuing to operate ahead of plan.</p><p>We launched One Africa at the beginning of July and Maria Ramos is now CEO of the Africa region. Total income was up 7.5% when we combine revenues from all of our activities across Africa. As you know, we have top tier businesses in many African markets, and our One Africa strategy will deliver the entire capabilities of Barclays in an integrated way across the continent.</p><p>Within Barclays Capital, while overall income was down, there was good growth in the businesses that have been targeted to build out globally. Equity and Prime Services grew 5%. Investment Banking was up 11%. Market share in both is growing. We are also pleased with the strong performance in UK Retail and Business Banking, where income grew 4% in the first half as we continue to upgrade the customer experience by investing in our branches, in our technology and in our people.</p><p>Our fourth priority is citizenship and for me this embraces several important elements. It's about the way we behave, in particular the way we treat customers and clients. It's about the way we help our customers and clients create jobs and economic growth. It's about the way we support the communities in which we work.</p><p>Operating with integrity lies at the very heart of our focus on citizenship. We know that trust in this industry has been damaged in recent years. We know we do not always get things right for every customer. When we get them wrong, we apologize and we put them right. That is our commitment.</p><p>In a challenging environment, we have continued to do all we can to support job creation and business growth by standing by our clients. In the first half, Barclays Capitalwas the leading book runner for debt capital markets globally. So at a time when we see a lack of certainty and a lack of confidence, we help clients raise more financing in public debt markets around the world than any other bank.</p><p>Here in the US, Barclays Capitalis a leader in taking companies public, enabling them to raise funds they need to invest in their businesses and to create jobs. In the United Kingdom, we held over 75,000 meetings with business clients in the first six months this year. We supported the startup of 50,000 new businesses. We approved a new loan to UK SME every four minutes.</p><p>We also continue to help the communities in which we live and work. In the first half, we supported more than 45,000 of our colleagues at Barclays as they worked for causes that they believe in. We did this by giving them time and matching their fundraising efforts. We care about being good citizens not just because it is the right thing to do, but because trust underpins our relationships with customers and clients. Trust underpins our reputation and our brand. Trust underpins the delivery of sustainable return for shareholders.</p><p>We recognize that markets have been greatly unnerved by fears about the future of the eurozone and by the prospect of low economic growth. Against that background of uncertainty and lack of confidence, we are very, very clear about our priorities. We have strengthened our capital position. We are investing selectively for growth. We are focused on returns.</p><p>Our three world-class businesses, which together account for two thirds of our capital, delivered a return on equity of 15% or more in the first half of this year. We're investing in our two businesses with potential to become top tier and they are already generating strong income growth and we have made progress with those businesses that need work. In short, we are on track to deliver a return on equity of 13% by 2013.</p><p>In recent times, the valuations of large, well-capitalized UK headquartered banks have been discounted due to uncertainty. Yet the UK is ahead of many others in addressing the challenge of reducing public debt. It's working hard on passing the mantle of growth from the public to the private sector and it does not face the challenges that we see in Europe.</p><p>The UK has the advantage of its own currency and of fiscal autonomy. With this week's report from the Independent Commission on Banking, we are close to resolving regulatory uncertainties in the United Kingdom. In times of stress, rock-solid capital, liquidity and funding is a strong differentiator. It may now be time to look at well-capitalized, UK headquartered banks in a new light.</p><p>Thank you very much. I'm going to be joined up here by Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier, Co-Chief Executives of Barclays Capital, and of course Chris Lucas, our Finance Director. We'll be very happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Given the environment and the stresses in different parts of your business, you've been pretty straightforward in being committed to your share and your stock in BlackRock and the dividend. Do the events of the past two months give any thought to revisit either of those?</p><p>CHRIS LUCAS, GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS PLC: The dividend, as you know, is at a relatively low level. It's when we restarted it, we wanted to be prudent in terms of the level of distribution but also progressive to give some uptick.</p><p>I don't think anything has changed. We reached that policy on the basis of the uncertainty and particularly the regulatory uncertainty. We have, I think, been stood well by it. So I see no reason why we would change the policy, which will remain prudent so well-covered, but will be slightly progressive.</p><p>In terms of the BlackRock stake, that's an important investment for us. It's an important asset and we have no intention of doing anything different with it than we've done at the moment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: What would you say is the probability of having more ICB ring-fencing in other countries? Because obviously you've been reducing exposures to places where you have no deposits, but you still have excess assets or loan-to-deposit ratios in certain countries. How are you going to address that issue? I mean, taking into account it's being funded [wholesale from now].</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: I guess I'd make two comments. First of all, we don't believe any bank should be too big to fail. As a successful bank who's managed through the crisis, we suffered from a lot of the turmoil as everyone else did. So as a strong bank, we very much want strong regulation.</p><p>But I think our advice to any country would be the same as it was in the United Kingdom. It's not the optimal solution, you know, the way we are running Barclays with a focus on operational subsidiarization. There are many ways to solve the problem that is trying to be solved here, which is if there were a problem somewhere in the world, could you cauterize that problem so that the branches stay open, consumers who have no other option can get to their banks, small businesses can get to their banks. That's right at the heart of our resolution and recovery plan.</p><p>So as we said, this is the decision that's been made, I think it's given a very, very good timeframe and I think it's given some flexibility so we can work within it. But it wouldn't be something that we would advise as the solution. I don't know if --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: How do you become comfortable with counterparty risk, especially with the seemingly distressed situation in some of the eurozone countries?</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: You want to take that one, Jerry?</p><p>JERRY DEL MISSIER, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARCLAYS CAPITAL, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CORPORATE &amp; INVESTMENT BANKING, BARCLAYS PLC: Sure. I think you become comfortable not by focusing on it at the 11th hour and 59th minute before a crisis hits. I think you become comfortable because it's something that you manage on an ongoing basis and we have been very proactive in looking at all of our exposures. Certainly post 2008, there was a big change in what assumptions you could make about how certain relationships would hold and just what constituted a genuine stress and since that time, have implemented a very, very rigorous approach to collateral management and monitoring what's going on with counterparties, and feel comfortable with our counterparty exposure today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: In the UK retail bank, there is significant pressure on the net interest margin compared to the past. The banking regulator and government, etc. and consumers don't like when banks make fee income in different forms. What is the roadmap to improving retail UK bank profitability, given the constraints that you face on the funding side and on the political pressure on not being able to generate enough fee income?</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: As I pointed out, one of our three world-class businesses is our UK Retail and Business Banking business. Even in a difficult environment of the first half of the year, it had a 15% return on equity. I think what you've seen in the way that it's been managed by Antony Jenkins and the team below him is a real focus on the customers. That has gone right to the heart of our investment in technology; it's gone right to the heart -- for any of you that have been there -- of the much different look and feel of our branches.</p><p>So to get the kind of revenue growth that we got in the first half of this year across our UK retail and business bank, in an environment of very low interest rates, as you say, and reducing margins altogether is a sign of how we're running it. Now, we're one of the biggest players in the market, so there isn't a lot of -- you know, it's not a growth market in that respect.</p><p>But the other thing I would point to is the -- it's so hard to bring out live in a speech like this. But I did refer to the way we're running Barclays and the way that the management team is working together and somewhat as a response to the environment we're in is it's much more joined up and integrated. So part of our excitement in the UK retail bank is a much more efficient operation, which is better technology, better efficiency, better straight-through processing, both in the retail bank and in the card business.</p><p>Secondly, just the incredible synergy opportunities that are available by the businesses working more closely together. So one of the examples I will give you that has been really, really exciting is in the Barclaycard business, which has traditionally been a consumer card business, particularly in the UK, more than a business card, and where our big growth opportunity is on the business side. I look every month, when I sit with the executive committee, and we just look at line after line after line after line of new accounts and the revenue that came from the new accounts on the business side that are directly a result of our corporate bank working more closely with them in different areas of those institutions.</p><p>So I think in a time of turmoil, with all the focus on regulation and capital, one of the things that people have been missing is how much better well-run banks are at finding both the cost efficiencies and the revenue efficiencies. I think to me, having behind us the fact that the United Kingdom wants to have in its home large integrated banks like Barclays and recognizes the importance of diversification, both for our customers and clients and for how we run the bank internally, that was my biggest fear in terms of \"potential ring-fencing solutions.\"</p><p>Do you want to say anything on the margins that I'm not touching on there?</p><p>CHRIS LUCAS: I was going to say, if you look at the margins that we disclosed, there was a slight uptick 2011 on 2010. That is very much through the selectivity in terms of what the products are and what we can earn off them. We've been working on that for a couple of years and the guys have been saying, \"You'll see an improvement, you'll see an improvement, you'll see an improvement,\" and for the first substantive period, we've managed to do that. That is in the face of some pretty stiff competition.</p><p>So we think it's good progress and particularly on the asset margin. As you know, the liability margin is impacted by very low interest rates.</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: Let's ask Rich to talk about this a little bit, but in line with your question and where I started going -- and it's so hard to work it into a speech, and it's so hard to get focused on it when so much focus has been on the regulatory environment. But we decided about a year and a half ago to align our corporate bank alongside Barclays Capitalwith joint management. The transformation of that business -- not just in the UK, but around the world -- is really beginning to come through. I don't know if you want to talk about some of the examples that we're seeing.</p><p>RICH RICCI, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARCLAYS CAPITAL, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CORPORATE &amp; INVESTMENT BANKING, BARCLAYS PLC: Yes, I think that that's right. I think starting with the UK, where the business has gone from number four in terms of customer service and customer surveys to number two -- great progress. We had a real opportunity, I think, with some of the issues that were befuddling some of our competitors, government ownership, etc., to really take advantage of sort of they were busy with other things to really get close to those clients and consumers. We've had a lot of people switch to Barclays. It's a very exciting story and we see no reason why that business can't not only return to where it used to be, in terms of GBP1.5 billion of profit, but exceed that.</p><p>Outside the UK, it was really a cleanup effort, I think, from some asset-led strategies that didn't have scale, some businesses that were subscale. One of the first things that Jerry and I tackled was really the credit quality and the issues in those countries. So we took a lot of pain, I think, for instance in Spain last year, in our Middle Eastern businesses. I think you'll have seen the overall business return to profitability this year and particularly businesses like the Middle East or businesses like Russia, for instance, where we had real negative revenues as we're in the process of disposing of Russia and the Middle East has been kind of a turnaround story. So a lot of good progress there and again, I think that the whole positioning of Barclays in the UK and the brand that it carries around the world will continue to enhance that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: You mentioned financial integration and you thought for the European countries to move closer together. Can you expand upon how you think this situation plays out and what do you mean by that, that you think is the end game?</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: I would love to, but most of what I've learned about this, I've learned from Jerry. So rather than tell you what Jerry thinks, I'll let Jerry tell you what Jerry thinks.</p><p>JERRY DEL MISSIER: I think you've got short-term issues and then structurally the long term. I think it's important to understand that it was always going to require a crisis of profound magnitude to really force Europe to take the next step towards fiscal consolidation. Because at the end of the day, it involves a loss of sovereignty and for the first 10 years of its existence, I think everyone's been able to have a free lunch. The Germans have had 60% of their export market locked into a currency that was too rich for them and the peripheral countries got the benefit of lower rates without actually having to behave fiscally responsibly.</p><p>So we're now kind of going through this having had dinner, now they're dividing the check and it's going to take a while to work through this. I mean, this process that Bob talked about will take years and it will be done in the face of social unrest and it will have to require, in essence, a ceding of sovereignty over fiscal issues towards much, much more centralized control over budgets. I think it's going to require some very difficult decisions about the nature of the social welfare state, which is a very, very big deal in Europe and these are not things that will sort themselves out quickly. So if we're expecting that in the next month they're going to announce fiscal union, I mean, it's just not going to happen. This is going to take time. So we should understand that.</p><p>I think in the short run, you have really the issue of somehow needing to bring stability back to the sovereign debt markets. Part of that is dealing with Greece in a way that doesn't create contagion elsewhere. Part of it is, I think, continued intervention so that the countries other than Greece are able to access debt at low rates that don't become an impediment to growth.</p><p>Then I think, frankly, part of it is also that you'll see a more growth-oriented approach to monetary policy. It would surprise me if that wasn't one of the things that came out of this. This whole challenge has been exacerbated by the fact that it's happening while we've seen growth slowing in the US and growth slowing in Europe and we kind of -- there needs to be a focus on getting growth back in the system to help some of these countries deal with their issues.</p><p>So look for it to be long-term. Don't underestimate the commitment. This is all about peace and prosperity and creating a sustainable Europe. You can expect to see continued brinksmanship between the central authorities and the member states. But I think ultimately it will head in the right direction. If there are issues where banks -- there needs to be recapitalization and I think a stability of markets allows that to happen. I think it plays itself out in the near term and then it will be an issue that we'll have to watch over a period of years.</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: To put kind of what's the ultimate goal that Jerry mentioned in context, I think this ages me quite a bit, but I recall working on the first ECU bond in 1992 for the Bank of England. From the beginning of the single currency in 1999, for those of us that were in the markets then, the transformation to have a market other than the US dollar market -- other than the US located here, because the euro bond market, if you recall, while that was a big liquid dollar market, it was for sovereigns and supernationals. It wasn't for corporates. Corporates really went to the US market.</p><p>One of the things that's really driven the economic growth over the last 15 years in Europe has been a big, liquid, deep sovereign market that's allowed corporates to price, whether it's in bond deals or equity deals, as Jerry said. Think about the alternative of going back to having a single dollar currency market in the US. So the vested interest away from a lot of the issues that are getting the publication, but having a big, liquid, deep sovereign debt market with the same safety and security characteristics of the US Treasury, allowing you to price corporate deals and get liquid corporate deals and get financial institution deals, which you can't get off today.</p><p>The stakes are very high for Europe here, in terms of their economic future and in terms of the financial markets existing in this time zone. So I think sometimes we jump to the conclusion that there is a crisis and the conclusion has to be fall apart as opposed to stay together. But I think the underpinnings of why this will stay together are very strong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: This might be more for you, Jerry, just in part following on your comments about Europe. With respect to Barclays Capital, how would you characterize the impact that all of this plus the numerous other overhangs have had on client trading activity, recently as opposed to maybe earlier in the summer, both from an activity perspective as well as from a facilitation perspective? One of the things we heard from Goldman in a meeting last night is just that the market conditions have continued to be challenging around putting risk capital to work to facilitate trading, just given the difficulty in sizing the unknowns, essentially.</p><p>JERRY DEL MISSIER: Clearly, July and August, very challenging market conditions. There's almost an unprecedented number of layers of uncertainty that we're having to deal with and bit by bit they get peeled away. I think it's been hard for investors to decide; as attractive as asset markets are, the memory of 2008 lingers. Therefore, why make a decision too early until we see exactly how the Greek situation is resolved or how some of these short-term issues are resolved?</p><p>It feels, certainly, like given the low levels of risk that most investors are running, the high degree of cash positioning, that a resolution of just a few of these things, I think, can see a pretty significant degree of investment into markets, especially given the level of asset prices. So we think there's a scenario where it's quite a positive environment for the run into the year end.</p><p>On the other side, you also have a very, very healthy pipeline of primary issuance -- both on the equity side and the debt side, high yield and investment grade -- that's waiting for a reasonable market environment and as we saw, there was a healthy M&amp;A pipeline as well. So clearly, things will be subdued until some of these issues get cleared up, but I think they can change; the environment can change pretty quickly.</p><p>RICH RICCI: I think J.P. Morgan said earlier that they thought that for the industry, revenues were down 30% or so in the third quarter. From what we sense and see, that's a reasonable estimate. But as far as Barclays Capitalis concerned, we tend to outperform in a tough environment, so the next couple of weeks are important. But I think Jerry's right. I think there could be an opportunity and a scenario where things could pick up quickly. So as an industry, let's hope for the best.</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: The level of de-risking is pretty significant, is our conclusion. That alone won't change things but the level of de-risking in the markets is pretty phenomenal, in terms of the years I've been in the business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's very early stage on the ICB report, but a lot of the conclusions have been that the cost of funding will increase for you and rating agencies could potentially downgrade basically part of the new entity or, if you want, the structure. I mean is there any part of the balance sheet you would consider de-gearing if your cost of funding is increasing, additional to what you already said that you are sort of getting rid of on the legacy assets?</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: Well, I think in the big picture, which I'll try, and then Chris, if there's a specific question about -- I'm not sure if you're asking specifically about what funding is like or what the rating agencies are going to do. It would be \"shame on us\" right now if this conclusion came as a big shock to us -- so in terms of how we're running our business, if we came out today and said, \"Oh my goodness, with the ICB report we're going to completely change the way we're doing things or exit this or enter this.\" I don't think it was that big a surprise, in terms of the interim report in April and obviously we've been working very, very closely with them. So I don't think you should see dramatic change.</p><p>What I think is great -- and I must say, I feel it very deeply -- is it's been quite a while where there's been a cloud hanging over the United Kingdom. Some of it has been a feeling that they've been super equivalent. Some of it, I think a lot of it, was driven by the Independent Commission on Banking. When you pick up the paper everyday and there's speculation at the extremes, it causes a de-risking in the UK. If you step back today, which is why I made that in the final comment, is it time to look differently at successful international banks headquartered in the UK, given that it is a strong regulatory environment? Given that we have now determined pretty much where we're going in terms of the Independent Commission, what the timeframe is, how certainly we've been a believer in resolution and recovery, and a lot of these things were part of the plan and I think the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have done the right thing. So if I can give my personal assessment, I think if the UK had been downgraded as the US had, it would have had much more severe consequences.</p><p>So for the Chancellor and the Prime Minister to have been out there early in reducing spending and focusing on getting the deficit and the debt down, they've had some pressure and they need the economic growth to get going. But the economy's going to go only one way if you're reducing public spending and that's to pass the mantle of growth to the private sector, which in the UK is very healthy as it is in the US -- a lot of cash on the balance sheet; even small businesses have a lot of cash. A little bit of certainty around bank capital, so banks can be more active and more confident, and a little bit more confidence in the economy and the direction of the administration could go a long way, together with the independence of the currency in the fiscal integration.</p><p>So I feel a lot better that there's been -- in a funny way, even though the report isn't that much different than what I would have discussed with everyone here over the last 12 months, I feel a big cloud has been lifted off the UK. I think that's going to be very helpful to our franchise and our business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible question - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: I already said yes. Can I just get that one? Sorry.</p><p>This better be good now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, I know. The pressure is on.</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: A lot of pressure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's actually about risk-weighted assets and the investment bank and I think you've talked about this, so forgive me for not remembering. But did you tell us what the new RWA, the projected RWA would be at the investment bank? The increase -- I think there was meant to be some offsets, some mitigating measures. Can you just review that?</p><p>CHRIS LUCAS: We can touch on that. We've given you the estimates of Basel 2.5, which is the market risk RWAs that come on at the end of this year. That's about GBP40 billion and we showed you the impact on our core Tier 1 ratio at the 30th of June. So to go beyond that into Basel 3, we've given some views -- we did so at the investor day -- in terms of the size of growth of RWAs and some views about management actions. But we said that's, by very nature, a broad estimate as we continue to refine the methodologies and the approach to the management of RWAs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And what were --?</p><p>BOB DIAMOND: We'll follow up with you. I think we need to get -- but if you want to follow up with Chris after this, we can do that. Jason, thank you for everything you've done to put this on and David, thank you very much.

There's more people in this room now than we had this morning. So those I don't know or haven't met, I'm Jason Goldberg. I cover the U.S. large-cap bank stocks here at Barclays. I'm told, we had over 200 companies. This is the largest financial services sell-side conference ever. So thank you for turning up and helping make this a success so far. To maximize our time this afternoon, I'll save a lot of thank-yous that go into making this conference a success until Wednesday and leave time for today's lunch keynote speaker.</p><p>In Barclays, we have a perfect company for a keynote presentation at a global financial services conference as it bills itself as a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank with a global reach. With us today is Jes Staley, Group CEO of Barclays. And my boss's, boss's, boss's boss. Jes has been at the Barclays and in this role for about 3 years and 3 quarters, and I can personally attest to the positive impact he's had on the organization, particularly not in the smoothest of macro times.</p><p>I'm going to come over, and with -- Jes and I will do a keynote fireside chat.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY, GROUP CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS PLC: Before you start, if I can just say, this is a record attendance we understand for any financial services conference. And if we can get the mic adjusted and that's very much a function of Jason, and his impact for us is outstanding because there's nothing better than being a financial institution and hosting the best financial service conference in the industry. So congratulations, Jason.</p><p>The other thing I want to say is almost everyone in this room is our client, and we've made it a cornerstone of our strategy to be one of the more successful bulge bracket investment banks anchored in New York and London. And you are very much a part of that foundation, and the business you do with us every single day leads us to the strategic goal that we set out for ourselves in March 2016. So it's an honor to be here with all of you. You're extremely important to Barclays, and we appreciate your support, and we're glad we can bring everyone together in a conference as successful as what Jason you're writing here with everyone.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Thank you, Jes. Appreciate that. This morning, in this room, we kicked off with former Dallas Fed Chair Richard Fisher, and he clearly talked to the uncertain macro backdrop globally that we're seeing. I guess how are you thinking about Barclays today as you approach some of your key milestones with the RoTE targets of greater than 9% this year and greater than 10% next?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Well, we feel very confident in our profit target for this year of 9% or better. For the first 6 months, we delivered 9.4%, and in 5 of the last 6 months, we've delivered over 9%. So it's not a big leap to basically repeat what we've been delivering for over a year now. And there are a lot of macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds. Part of our diversified model is to be both in the U.K. and outside the U.K. So a little over 40% of our revenues are dollar-based. When the sterling weakens like this, given our cost and revenue mix, that's a headwind for us. If we -- if you drop the sterling exchange rate by 10 points for the GBP 1.20 to GBP 1.10, that adds about GBP 250 million to GBP 300 million of additional PBT for the bank. So with the diversified model, macro trends will both help us and hurt us.</p><p>But there really is some new things happening, particularly in Europe, that I think we all have to be very mindful of. We had been in this room 10 years ago, and we've done one of these polls that Jason does that said if we had a 10-year growth rate in the economy of the U.S. and Europe and if 10 years from now, we have the lowest unemployment rate virtually in the history of the United States and in the history of the U.K., where would the 10-year be -- rate be? And I bet almost all of us would've had up on the poll somewhere between 4% and 6%. But at minimum, I think that we would've had a 4 handle. And now we're looking, and you have $20 trillion of sovereign debt with the absolute negative interest. The U.K. 10-year gilt is trading at under 50 basis points. And in the U.S., as Fisher talked about, we're cutting interest rates in the U.S.</p><p>So there is a phenomenon going out there where the markets just do not feel a sense of concern around inflation and wage pressure. So we, in the bank industry, particularly in Europe, particularly those banks that are in absolute negative markets, it's a real challenge to run a bank facing virtually flat interest rates. We're all going to feel that. And then the challenges sort of double down when you have a flat yield curve. The flip side, I think -- and I think we'll see that in the U.K. -- is I think people are warming to the fact that the response to drive economic recovery when you're near or at 0 interest rates, it's not monetary, but rather it's fiscal. And really, what happened in the United States to drive the economic growth for the last number of years was United States government basically became far less worried given where interest rates were in running a fiscal deficit. There are 2 countries that I think are very focused on the fiscal deficits despite having the lowest interest rates in the market, one being Germany, a really big issue, but also the U.K. The U.K.'s deficit to GDP is about 1%, one of the lowest of any G20 country. And as I said, our 10-year gilt is below 50 basis points. I would argue that if you can borrow on a real basis at negative interest rates, you should be far less worried about your fiscal deficit and far more focused on your fiscal policies driving economic growth. And I think that's one of the things in the conversation that we've had, and I think is embraced by the current Chancellor in the U.K. and by the current Prime Minister. So as we look at the issue of Brexit and whatnot, I think we feel that there's some macro challenges in front of us, these would be interest rates, macro advantages for us in terms of currency and macro advantages for us, if in fact, the British Government is about to apply a fiscal stimulus to its economy and as everyone noticed in the United States, the most powerful way for fiscal stimulus to immediately turbocharge an economy is through tax cuts. So I would watch that.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Interesting. You made a comment about Barclays' diversified model. Can you maybe just talk to why you think this is so important in the current macro environment?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: We've all gone through a lot of financial markets' ups and downs and we get -- and we -- and sort of our views of the markets are very much embedded in the history that we've lived through. To my mind, in 2008 and 2009, one of the biggest lessons was the countercyclicality between a wholesale bank and a consumer bank. If you think back, we were at JP Morgan on the operating committee back then. In 2008, investment bank lost some $24 billion at JP Morgan, the worst performance ever in the -- in their investment bank. But the bank made money every quarter because the consumer bank had actually quite a profitable year in 2008. In 2009, Morgan's credit card business and home equity loan business lost $30 billion, but the bank made money every quarter because the investment bank had a record year.</p><p>One of the few other banks to through the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, making money every single quarter was Barclays for exactly the same reason, the countercyclicality through an economic cycle of a wholesale business versus a consumer business.</p><p>We've spent the last couple of years trying to defend a wholesale business, while a consumer business was enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in the UK and the US. If there is an economic slowdown, not that I'm hoping for one, it'll be nice to be watching the wholesale business perform relative to the consumer business and change the nature of the discussion. So it's that diversification of the revenue stream, which I think -- the economic cycles will be there, they will come back. We haven't solved that, and as you</p><p>Go through those economic cycles, I think the diversification of our model and being a universal bank will show its cards.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: One of the topics this morning, we didn't get really a touch on was -- is Brexit. Maybe you could share with us what's your best guess for what happens next? How is Barclays prepared? And then also maybe just talk to the impact on U.K. in terms of, I guess, potential of economic downturn, lower rates, increased competitive pressures from traditional and emerging competitors? Just how is Barclays U.K. positioned?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Well, Brexit, more than anything else, is challenging the political structure of the UK. It's a parliamentary government without a constitution. There are a lot of rules being written, and obviously, the inability to come to a consensus following the referendum vote is really challenging the political institutions of the United Kingdom. And as I think, you've seen in a lot of other countries, political institutions are under challenge. And so elections are very difficult to predict. But for sure, I think everyone is read -- is arriving at a level of frustration at the political uncertainty in the UK, which is not healthy.</p><p>In terms of the economic impact, personally, I think the economic impact has pretty much been felt. We have a much lower sterling. So on a purchasing power basis, everyone in the UK is less well off because of the uncertainty. We have had slower economic growth than some of the countries that you would compare us to. The Bank of England came out with a number saying they think that the amount of new investment in the U.K. is 11% lower over the last 3 years than otherwise would've been. It's very hard to prove the counterfactual, but I think we've felt a lot of the economic challenge of this uncertainty that we've been living through today.</p><p>Between a deal and a no-deal, I personally think that there'll be a medium and long-term impact between no-deal and a deal, and you can debate that. But I think the short-term impact, as you transition either through a deal or transition through a no-deal, it's not going to be as dramatic as some people are talking about, much like the short-term economic impact of the referendum vote was not what people expected. It was not the Armageddon.</p><p>The services industries like Barclays, we are a 100% ready whether it's a no-deal or deal or soft Brexit or hard Brexit. We have recapitalized our bank in Dublin, in Ireland. By the end of this year, we'll be the largest Bank in Ireland. We've taken all of our branches across Europe, and we have relicensed them to be branches of the bank in Ireland as opposed to the branches in England or in Great Britain. We have moved all the people that we're going to move. We have staffed all the desks. We've built all the models that we need to build. We're in a very good place with our regulators. And almost all of our clients that need to migrate to deal with us in the European context have migrated. So October 31st comes and goes. It will have almost zero impact on Barclays. And I think most of the service industry is in very similar shape.</p><p>In terms of the goods and the supply chain, what people know is, the UK is in a huge deficit in that position. We -- the United Kingdom imports many more goods than they export. There are 100,000 companies in France that export a product every day to United Kingdom. I don't think they're going to shut the border. The pain will be felt on the other side of the canal. Now -- so the uncertainty has created lack of investment, et cetera, but I think through a transition period, trade deals will be reached, and they'll find a mutually benefit outcome. In the long run, which is the better one, we will see.</p><p>I think the real issue is not between a Brexit and a hard Brexit, I think it's very likely that there is a general election sometime between here in the first quarter, unless somehow it gets pushed towards a new referendum. And that, a new referendum, personally, I think would be quite a challenge. But I think what everybody wants is to get uncertainty behind us. We're ready as a bank. We think most of our clients are ready, and I think we do have to get on with it.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: In answer to you -- in your answers to my diversification question, it sounded -- I heard a hint of optimism around the Corporate and Investment Bank. But how -- I guess what makes you confident about the outlook for the CIB industry, given the challenges that many had generating above cost of capital returns, particularly some of the smaller players? And what specific actions are you taking to improve our returns?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: So I -- so to me, the primary regulatory response to the financial crisis was to rely less on bank balance sheets and what's called maturity transformation to generate economic growth than we had historically.</p><p>So if you look at Europe and United States, the amount of bank balance sheets financing businesses has actually in absolute terms declined over the last decade since the financial crisis.</p><p>On the flip side, what has replaced that is a belief that the capital markets do not impose the maturity transformation risk that bank balance sheets do. And therefore, let's rely on the capital markets in order to fund economic growth. And indeed, over the last decade, the capital markets have roughly doubled in size. So just as from the most macro level, if you want to be involved in financing economic growth in a developing market, I think you have to recognize that the regulatory stack now is built behind growing the capital markets and putting a limit on the growth of bank balance sheet. That's the first reason given that we want to stay close to our existing client base that staying in the capital markets as a bulge bracket bank is so important.</p><p>Now you have the influence of technology. And I think there is a race between the buy-side wanting to decrease their cost of transacting with the sell-side providing technology solutions that end up preserving the margins of the intermediaries, but at the same time, helping the cost base for the buy-side. And I think we're on that journey, and that's clearly something -- clearly, that it is something to watch.</p><p>The second thing is capacity is leaving the market. There are a lot of major players that have essentially decided to leave as intermediary in the capital markets. And the FT article the other day talking about will Barclays \"Will be the last man standing?\" There is capacity leaving and hopefully that is reflected in the economics for those that have decided to stick it out.</p><p>There are other things that are going on in the regulatory framework. Regulators love securities financing. So whether it's prime credit or prime equities, the calculation of risk-weighted asset for a broker-dealer extending credit to a buy-side firm collateralized by liquid securities is one of the most attractive risk weights in the industry. And I think a lot of what's driving those banks that are improving their profitability is around the prime services, which is, in some banks, it's 30%, 40% of their markets' revenues.</p><p>So the final point for me is, if you think about this as a long-term trend line and don't underestimate how dramatic the financial crisis was for the financial industry and how extraordinary the reregulation of the industry has been. You just take Barclays. Barclays, 10 years ago, our CET1 ratio against the risk of the bank was 4%. Our CET1 ratio now is effectively 14%. The calculation of risk-weighted assets back then -- the calculation of the risk-weighted asset 10 years ago, a AAA securities' risk weight was 0. A -- the risk-weighted assets of a 30-year interest rate swap with an acceptable ISDA was 0. Now we turn on the lights, and we have operational risk-weighted assets. If you take those 2 judgments -- or those 2 adjustments, CET1 capital and the calibration of risk, and it's no joke. 20% of the capital of Barclays is held against an operational risk, which is not an asset. The one thing I will guarantee you is the return on tangible equity, the 20% of our capital is 0. If you made the adjustments, roughly back then pro forma basis, Morgan's -- a Barclays' CIB was generating, let's say, 15%, 16% RoTE. You make the adjustment to capital, the exact same business, the exact same revenues, we will be over 60% today. So that's the trend line that's happening, and I think if you miss that trend line, by the time it catches up with you, you will have regretted that move.</p><p>And so one of the challenges or frustrating things is we've essentially taken the profitability of Barclays in the last 3 years from 5% to 9% and against a much higher capital base. So that in the first half of this year, as a statutory basis, this was the most profitable first 6 months of Barclays in over a decade. As I said, we moved our CET capital ratio. There's an adjustment that we're currently discussing with the PRA, but we would've landed at the midyear at 14%. The highest capital ratio this bank has had in anyone's recollection.</p><p>Then we took our dividend, and we've tripled it in 3 years. So that -- so we announced a new dividend policy at the annual results, that's the highest dividend that's paid -- this bank has paid in over 10 years. So we've gone through a massive restructuring. We have 56,000 less people. We're out of the continent of Africa. We sold 22 businesses. It's just a huge change, and it's one of the most profitable 6 months this bank has ever had. And our stock is 50% of book.</p><p>So we don't blame management, we blame everybody, no. So I feel that we like universal banking model. We like the trajectory of the Corporate and the Investment Bank. One of the things particular to Barclays that we've got a real focus on in getting real-time transaction, the most unprofitable thing we do at the bank is to extend an undrawn revolving line of credit. And you can track a client-by-client return on risk-weighted assets pretty easily. And our problem was, we had too many companies that we were extending undrawn revolvers to that weren't doing corollary transaction business with us, and that led us to have a return on risk-weighted assets, which was unacceptably low. Before we got here, that really wasn't a focus of the bank, it's a laser focus now. And we have made significant progress over the last couple of years of improving the rate of return on risk-weighted assets, by driving transactional business payments, foreign exchange, trade finance, et cetera, to support where we were extending undrawn lines of credit. And over a 2-year, we -- 2-year period, and we're well on track, we expect for our largest clients to double the return on risk-weighted asset that we're generating. So -- and that in turn will deliver comfortably a double-digit return from our corporate bank. So things like that are the progression, and I think that we're in a good place.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: One of the concerns we hear right here from global financial services' investors is about just a lower-for-longer rate outlook globally, how big of a challenge is that for Barclays?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: It's a challenge in -- for all of us, but particularly for those countries like Japan and Europe that has -- seem to have lower, lower, lower for longer. But that being said, we have a great franchise in the U.K. around secured consumer lending and unsecured consumer lending. And our net interest margin is 300 basis points. I think I'd put that up against almost any bank. And what we've been doing since the referendum vote, we've been rebalancing our mix of unsecured to secured in order to improve -- or, in our own mind, reduce the potential risk of our U.K. consumer credit book. With interest rates coming down, and as we go through this uncertainty, and the position of the U.K. consumer is actually quite good, our impairment numbers are quite solid. We very well may -- are reflecting these lower interest rates begin to rebalance or unsecured with our concern. And that gives us the ability to preserve a degree of NIM. So you do have levers that you can push to manage through that.</p><p>The bigger challenge, I think, is less in your net interest margin as much as managing your overall liquidity. And that's where managing your liquidity in a cash environment, where you got to leave a certain amount of cash and hold government securities is tough when they are getting lower. But again, for us, that's why we like having such a significant part of our balance sheet in the U.K. I'd much rather have 140 basis points in the U.S. than negative 70 in Germany.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Interesting. I guess one of the things you've been clear on, maybe too clear, is kind of cost control and the ability to manage expenses in terms of making sure Barclays has achieved its RoTE objectives. Can you maybe talk to your outlook on costs? And then when you were here 2 years ago, you spent a bit of time talking about the services company, which we now call BX, just what role did that play?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: So on the cost side, we sat in March of 2016 and said, \"We have to restructure the bank, reorganize the bank, deal with conduct and litigation issues.\" And at some point, we need to get the topic du jour, of the day, of PPI. And so we embarked upon a journey. We created our service company, which has about 55,000 of our 85,000 employees. We've created what are called transaction cycles, which are processes that cut across all of our lines of businesses but are similar processes like fraud. And what we've really done. If you sit back and look at the numbers for the last 3 years, we have improved our RoTE roughly from 5% to 9%. Half of that has come from roughly a GBP 1.5 billion decrease in our run rate expenses, and half of it has come from about GBP 1.5 billion in increases in revenues, by investing in technology and people, et cetera, et cetera. So roughly a 50-50 mix has allowed us to take our cost-income ratio from 73% -- or from 72% down to 63%. And if you look at that cost-to-income ratio compared with American banks, with the European banks, with big banks and small banks with model lines and online, that's a pretty good number. At 63%, we are in a pretty good place, actually. So that as I look forward to driving to the 10% RoTE and 11% RoTE, maintaining cost control is important. But we, as a management team, are beginning -- ever more thinking about, are we going to drive revenues? We're going to create new sources of revenues, we're going to improve our market share, our business mix, the efficiency of our capital use, but we don't want to drop down our cost by another GBP 1.5 billion.</p><p>What we're actually doing is, if you go back 2 years ago or even a year ago, most of our expenses were obligatory. We had to set up the ring-fence bank that cost GBP 1.4 billion in the U.K. We had to set up the IHC in United States that cost money. We had to set up the bank in Dublin for Brexit that cost money. We had to do a lot of things around the stability of our tech stack, so that we didn't go offline with any degree of regularity. Most of all of that is behind us. We have significantly decreased what we call the run-the-bank expense.</p><p>What we are doing now that we find our cost-to-income ratio in a more comfortable place, we are on target of improving the profitability as much as we've had to grow the bank. To invest technology spend for new algorithms and new trading platforms for technology to dramatically advance your client onboarding process. If you wanted to join our merchant acquiring platform a year ago, it would've taken you 5 weeks to get onboarded by our merchant acquiring business. We're now down to 1 day. And we want to get down to a function of minutes if we're going to compete with the fintechs. But that's growing your business, that allows us to add new small businesses that before we wouldn't have gotten it. And someone just opening a new online company is not going to wait for 5 weeks to get their online payment services done.</p><p>So we are investing to grow the business, we are digitizing the bank. We now have 8 million consumers that are banking through their mobile banking app with us exclusively that's growing 85,000 consumers a day. We now have open banking in the U.K. So through APIs, we can download 3x a day all your financial information in your Lloyds account and in your Royal Bank of Scotland account. So much so, if you like the value proposition of this bank 5 years ago was to get an 18-year-old walk into a branch, open a checking account and manage their financial life through that checking account. Now let's get the 18-year-old to go online and download the Barclays' app and manage their financial life through that, irrespective of whether the checking account is Lloyds or Barclays. And there's a massive difference between those 2 value propositions. The average customer walks into a bank branch once every 5 weeks. And they walk in, you have really no idea who they are. What they want to do, you really don't know until they click on. You may have an idea once they tell you who they are and what they're thinking about. You may have some system that tells a teller what's going on. The average consumer on the mobile banking app, they go on our site or on our app every day. And when they go on the app, we know exactly who they are. We know exactly what they've been doing. We have a pretty good idea actually what they're joining us all about. And the -- so the whole value proposition changes dramatically.</p><p>That's spending technology to grow the bank, that's what's so transformational about this versus 3 years ago when we were spending money to ring-fence the bank, to be compliant with new British regulation. So I feel good about that we now -- now the other benefit, when you do that spend for the ring-fence bank, you have no choice. It's going to be done by Easter 2018 or the British government is going to come down on you. So now we download a new version of the mobile app once every 7 days. We can roll that back to once every 8 days if we want to. It's a discretionary spend. So when we look at that GBP 13.5 billion, GBP 13.6 billion spend target, a lot of it is discretionary that we can dial up or dial down based on the performance of the bank.</p><p>And then for all those happy investment bankers here, we spent GBP 600 million in 2016 and '17 in order to bring forward the vesting of our bonus pool, so we can correlate our quarterly revenues with our quarterly compensation costs.</p><p>And I think just like an asset management business, you have to be able to regulate -- or manage your compensation expense with how you're doing in terms of alpha generation, et cetera, or your AUM numbers in order to have a more stabilized profit stream. And the same thing with the investment bank, and we believe that we can calibrate our bonus pool on a on-time basis, commensurate or correlated with our revenues. So we feel much more in control of the bank's cost base, and then as we look at that cost-to-income ratio, the solution now is not to continue this climb to knock down expenses, but rather to continue this new investment opportunity to grow revenues. And that's what's driving our belief that we'll get to 10% despite interest rates and that we'll continue to advance thereon.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: You've tucked on it for a second, but maybe we could delve more into payments. It's definitely a big focus of the investors that are here. Could you maybe talk to some of the changes to how consumer banking and payments is led at Barclays? You made some change there earlier in the year. And can you maybe talk a bit about your view of the opportunities that Barclays has? And just how you think about a bank-owned payment business can succeed against some of these pure-play companies?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Before I get to payments, let me just -- because I keep forgetting to -- which is we did an RNS a little bit ago for those who didn't see it, announcing our PPI expense range for the third quarter on the back of August, which was the last month for PPI claims in the United Kingdom. We predicted that a -- our claims will fall somewhere between GBP 1.2 billion and GBP 1.6 billion. Out there is what Lloyds is going to do and Royal Bank of Scotland. So that's range PPI ended at the end of August, so this is the last present from PPI. What I would say is that's probably about 40 to 50 basis points of CET1 ratio. We are -- remember, we closed the interims at 13.4% with our target at 13%. And so we're very comfortable that with current dividend policy in place, we will still easily land our end state capital CET1 ratio despite what we saw PPI today. So I just want to get that all out and clear. Hopefully, I believe I said it the right way.</p><p>Your question was?</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Payments?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Payments. So payments, I think, is the battlefield of finance for the next decade. And the players are clearly not just the banks. The players -- it is the vertical that the fintech players are most interested in. It is ultimately where the big tech players are going to get closer and closer to, whether it's Amazon, whether it's Facebook, creating a cryptocurrency for Facebook in Switzerland is a fascinating idea. But -- so I think the payment space is real.</p><p>And it's very important for, I think, a successful bank to maintain and manage the position we have across payments. In the U.K., a very big deal now is the degree of authentication that a consumer has to go through to allow a digital payment. We think we have certain competitive advantages because of our technology stack and what we're doing in this around the ability to authenticate who is making a payment. That's a big deal vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis fraud in the U.K. We, right now, have a payments platform that we think is a competitive advantage if and when we wanted to partner with a big tech company. So there are possibilities there.</p><p>And then for us, we have this platform idea where we have 8 million consumers banking with us on the Barclays app, growing at the rate it's growing. 36% of all merchandised sales in the U.K. goes across our merchant acquiring business. So can we take the relationship we have with our merchants on that app and combine it with the interest and desires of our consumers and create a platform that is around that payment space, which gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. There is no bank that has a merchant acquiring business like ours. There is no merchant acquiring business that has a mobile app like we do. So payments is a very big deal. I do think it's a war -- or the battleground of finance for the next decade, but I feel very confident about where we sit.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: While I pull up here, we can maybe open up to the audience for questions.</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: That's a warning, if you ask a question though.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Just while the audience is thinking of questions, I guess maybe shift gears and talk about the regulatory environment. How do you see that evolving from here for Barclays?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Well, we have said almost since day 1 of the Brexit, we think the Bank of England, what we need to be focused on is to maintain a competitiveness with the U.S. Given our business model and given that our role of wholesale banking, one of the reasons why Brexit didn't really worry me vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis a bank in the U.K. or a bank like us because we are less a function of equivalency with Brussels and much more important for us is equivalency with Washington and the New York Fed.</p><p>I think that the regulatory invasion of finance was very much needed. And I think we need to appreciate the fact that a lot of what we're doing in the banking industry created enormous economic destruction and a more proximate relationship between the regulators and those that are regulated was very much necessary.</p><p>I think what you're seeing in the U.S., and I think in a reasonably intelligent way, it's sort of a recalibration. I think from Randy Quarles to the Secretary of Treasury, they are, at the margins, trying to recalibrate the regulatory environment in the U.S., and I think that's a healthy thing. I don't think you throw out things like the Volcker Rule or whatnot. You cannot -- I don't believe you just swing the pendulum back to any significant degree, but some recalibration is right. And I think the Europeans are catching up to that as well. And we have a great regulatory relationship with the Bank of England, the PRA and the FCA. In many times, they have been very constructive with us in terms of helping us think about strategically what direction or operationally our controls we should use to manage the bank better.</p><p>Though, I think going back to your issue about payments and big tech and fintech, there are costs of being a massively regulated financial institution. But today, one thing that will cost -- stop Amazon at the door is, he's not going to become a G-SIFI. And so regulation is both a challenge, but to a certain extent is also walling off the banking industry. And hopefully, it shouldn't be done too much because we don't want to be insulated to that degree. But I think a lot of progress has been made around regulation.</p><p>Going back to where I started, we have significantly and dramatically improved the profitability of this bank under much higher capital levels and much stronger risk-weight calibrations. And I think that trend is going to continue. We're at a 9% RoTE. We don't have a strategic challenge. We want to execute better, and we will do that. But this is a really profitable bank, after years of massive reorganization and the reregulation of the industry. And I feel really good about where we are. I feel really good where the industry is going to be, and I would make my own view, and we talked about this inside of our -- inside of risk committee and with regulators. I think the next financial crisis will most likely emanate outside of the banking, and that's something for all of us to think about.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Any questions from the audience? Jeff?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Jes, thanks for your comments. There's a question, maybe I'd be interested to hearing about your U.S., (inaudible) I'd be interested to hear about how (inaudible) and also your -- where you're going to take market share in (inaudible)?</p><p>JAMES EDWARD STALEY: Yes, I think we've been refining. I think there's been a little bit of push and a pause. What is working very well for us is the co-brand card space. And strategically, what we have done is when we co-brand with an American Airlines or an Uber or a JetBlue, what co-brand means for us is not to have both brands in the front of the card. The co-brand, for us means it's an American Airlines card. It's an Uber card. Because we don't have a sizable Barclays card, we're not in competition with those people that we co-brand with. And I don't think -- I'm not sure that's where Chase is or MedExpress is. That strategic pivot is a very valuable asset as we build the co-brand space.</p><p>And what we're basically saying is, we want to build our unsecured consumer loan book in the United States, not off the Barclays brand, which would be extremely expensive to create on a national scale, but on the brand of the American Airlines. So we have 11 million consumers in the United States that use a Barclays credit today, in part because of loyalty with another brand. And we want to continue to drive that. And I think you'll see a lot of things happening in that space.</p><p>What that has meant is we are -- we have slowed down the building of a Barclays-branded digital consumer bank, not because we don't think that technically we can get there. Because what we have in the U.K., we do, obviously, believe that we can get there. But more, do you want to spend the marketing dollars to do that and scale? And that's a question we're dealing with now. But we love the U.S. consumer business. One thing I would say that I think, almost every credit card company in the world is thinking about and getting involved in is point-of-sale financing and installment lending. One of the things that we're learning from millennials, whether they're here in the U.S. or in the U.K. or Germany for that matter where we have a bigger -- we have the largest credit card in Germany, is millennials somewhat reluctant to pay the high interest rates of a revolving line of credit for them. They don't really like paying cash, they love paying over installment. So we -- right now, we are the bank behind 1 out of every 4 iPhones sold in the United Kingdom, and that's because you get to buy your iPhone over 10 installments. That's a very attractive product for that client segment. So that is another evolution I think of -- I think you'll see credit cards increasingly looking at the installment loan market.</p><p>JASON MICHAEL GOLDBERG: Any questions?

The parliament is officially on winter break and won't return until 9 September. That is not to say that there won't be news. Mike Pompeo is coming to town, ahead of Scott Morrison's  visit to the US next month, where he will be treated to a state dinner. The Liberal executive will be meeting tomorrow, where it will discuss how it has dealt with bullying complaints, and worst, in the past. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And there's also the small matter of building a legislative agenda. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Labor's review into what went wrong with the election is ongoing, with the final report to be handed down in October. But those talks and meetings are happening now, so stay tuned on that.</p><p>And the court of disputed returns will hear the petitions against the Kooyong and Chisholm elections - at least directions. The high court will be sitting for three of the next five weeks, which makes it a very strong chance you'll hear something.</p><p>So we hope you will keep popping back and checking the site for all your usual political news.</p><p>A very, very big thank you to Mike Bowers, who you'll find on Talking Pictures each Sunday, and cameo-ing on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/pyjamapolitics/\">Pyjama Politics</url>, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp  and Sarah Martin for all their work this last sitting, as well as the rest of the Guardian's brains trust, who you don't hear from, but stop me from setting my desk on fire each and every day. </p><p>As always, the biggest thank you goes to you all. I'll miss you over the next month, but I hope you take a bit of time to cocoon yourselves. The new normal seems to be settling in and soon we are going to be at the end of the year, wondering how we got to 2020 quite so quickly. Stay warm, even those of you in the greatest nation of earth, Queensland, where I know the Ekka Westerlies are about to start blowing.</p><p>See you soon.

His statement:</p><p>Hypocrisy and double standards are what we have come to expect from the Labor party.</p><p>But Mark Dreyfus sunk to new lows even for himself today when he accused the government of dragging its heels on the delivery of a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC).</p><p>To set the record straight, the Coalition - unlike Labor - has actually been doing the hard work necessary to deliver a carefully considered and properly funded watchdog since we first committed to establishing a CIC in December last year.</p><p>Attorney general Christian Porter said a draft bill was already being finalised, which would form the basis of public consultation and the final Bill would be completed by the end of the year.</p><p>'Our CIC will be properly designed and subject to a robust consultation phase,\" Mr Porter said.</p><p>'It has $106.7m of new money allocated to it in the current budget over the forward estimates, plus:</p><p>$40.7m in existing funding for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which will work alongside the CIC.</p><p>'In contrast, Labor has released what amounts to little more than a press release containing a vague set of design principles and a suggestion that $58.7 million would be enough to cover the costs. That is $89 million less than we have committed.</p><p>'But what is most hypocritical is that Labor was willing to allow itself a full year to draft their CIC legislation, had they won the election.</p><p>'Now all of a sudden they are attacking in the parliament their own reasonable time frame for properly developing and consulting on complex legislation in this important area of law.</p><p>'The reason why this legislation cannot be rushed should be obvious to Mr Dreyfus given the many examples of injustices and damage done to personal and professional reputations when the necessary time and care was not taken to properly design state-based integrity commissions.</p><p>'Labor might not care about hurting innocent people but the Morrison government does and we will not be lectured by hypocrites seeking to waste the parliament's time to score cheap political points.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.43am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 7.30am BST </p><p>The Law Council is not overly impressed with the passage of the latest national security bill, given the concerns that have been raised over it. From its statement:</p><p>The Law Council has grave concerns Asio's Questioning and Detention Warrant (QDW) powers have been extended for a further 12 months without clear justification.</p><p>These are some of the most far-reaching and extraordinary powers granted to any intelligence organisation in a western democracy and should be repealed. They give Asio the power to secretly and immediately detain persons whether or not they are suspected of terrorism-related activities.</p><p>While the Law Council understands and supports our national security agencies possessing the necessary powers required to prevent threats and keep the community safe, these must always be reasonable and proportionate in order to safeguard the rights of innocent Australians if such powers are mistakenly used or abused.</p><p>The QDW powers have never been exercised. It is not clear to the Law Council why these laws remain [afoot] when there are other wide-ranging powers that Asio and other agencies possess. </p><p>The Law Council is concerned these provisions may be unconstitutional and a breach of Australia's international human rights obligations.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.40am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 7.22am BST </p><p> Anthony Albanese  concludes his speech with:</p><p>We on this side of the House are united. We know exactly what the values of the Labor party are, we know what they stand for: a strong economy and jobs. We know we stand for social justice. </p><p>We know we stand for lifting people up, not leaving people behind. We know we stand for engagement on the environment. Australians don't want that much and they don't ask that much from the government, but they expect a bit of respect.</p><p> They expect that the government will actually have a plan. And a third-term government should have developed that plan into a coherent narrative. Yet what we see is more and more scare campaigns. </p><p>The fact is that Labor's values are shared not just by people who have a common interest, who are united not just because we happen to be in parliament, and not just because we happen to be in the Labor party, but because it is our shared values that [brought us to the] Labor party, a party that has been in existence since 1891, a party that has proud origins and a proud history, a party that will continue to contribute to this nation's history into the future.</p><p>So I say to the prime minister: you ask the question, consider it answered. We on this side of the House know exactly who side we are on. On that side of the House, they are so divided that they can't even get an answer from a prime minister about senior members of the Liberal party and the National party appearing on the same platform with extreme rightwing ideologues in order to promote division in this country, allowing the sort of talk that will just divide us.</p><p>I will conclude with the prime minister's question. </p><p>We know exactly who we are and we know whose side we are on. We are the Australian Labor party, and we are on the side of Australia's national interests. It's a pity that there is a government that isn't, that is just on the side of its own selfish political interests, and [which] seeks to divide people, promote fear and engage in negative politics because they don't have a positive agenda for the third term.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.28am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 7.21am BST </p><p>Albanese: </p><p>We on this side of the House to support a voice for First Nations people in our Constitution. Those opposite have roadblocks in their cabinet like the Minister for Home Affairs, who walked out on the apology. We on this side of the House understand that you can protect your borders without losing your humanity; those opposite have engaged in dehumanising people in our care for political gain. We on the side of the House appeal to hope; those on that side of the House rely upon fear. We want to shape the future in the interests of all Australians; those opposite are frightened of the present and terrified of the future. </p><p>Nowhere is that better characterised than in the NBN: we understand that fibre is the technology of the 21st century; those opposite rely on copper to go forward. </p><p>We on this side one genuine support for our farmers who are struggling in the drought, who need action on climate change, who need real funding; those opposite want legislation that gives them some money in the following financial year-$100 million rather than the $5 billion that they talk about. </p><p>We on this side of House are absolutely determined to bring the nation together. </p><p>We reject those who seek to divide us. </p><p>And the fact that in their No. 1 talking point, from the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer and to the Minister opposite, they talk about 'Whose side are you on?' </p><p>Shows exactly what they are about. They don't have a positive agenda, they rely upon negative politics and they seek to divide at every single opportunity.</p><p>block-time published-time 7.20am BST </p><p>Albanese continued: </p><p>We support those who are struggling and who need a helping hand. Those opposite say that people have never been better off, in spite of the reports just this week. We understand that free markets left alone, because they have no conscience, entrench existing relationships of power, both economic and social. Those opposite still support trickle-down economics. They say it will all be okay if government just gets out of the way. We understand that unions have a critical role in a democratic society. Those opposite just want to attack them. We understand the importance of holding business to account, which is why we supported the banking royal commission at the same time as they voted against it 26 times. We support building infrastructure; they support talking about building infrastructure. We respect public servants; they cut public servants. We respect the science of climate change; those opposite want equal time for climate sceptics to teach in the classroom. We regard education as being about creating opportunity; those opposite see it as just entrenching privilege.</p><p>We support Medicare being at the heart of the health system. Those opposite undermine it at every opportunity. We support increasing Newstart. Those opposite regard that as just 'unfunded empathy'. We support addressing homelessness. They want more positive spin about homelessness, to talk about the 99 per cent who are in homes rather than the one per cent who are homeless. We support pensioners. Those opposite say that the pension is too generous. We support aged care that looks after our vulnerable older Australians. Those opposite want to get rid of regulation and just let the market rip. We support superannuation as being critical for our nation. Those opposite undermine it. We support a free media. Those opposite have engaged in cynical, politically motivated raids and intimidation against journalists.</p><p>block-time published-time 7.20am BST </p><p>Anthony Albanese:</p><p>Just a few weeks ago we all stood in this House and debated the passing of Bob Hawke, a great Australian who stood for all Australians. Bob Hawke's  prime ministership was characterised by an understanding that together we are stronger. He looked for common ground. Nothing could stand in more contrast with that than what we've seen from this government in its three-week self-indulgent vanity project, this victory lap where it has brought parliament back in July.</p><p>The fact is that the prime minister is in search of an agenda. In place of that, he's chosen division. He characterises that himself when he stands in parliament and has the talking points for all the ministers about, 'Whose side are you on?' </p><p> Billy Bragg, at the beginning of the year, said about international democratic politics at the moment, that: This is a time of dismissive demagogues promoting a know-nothing politics of swaggering arrogance driven by scorn and spite.</p><p>I'm reminded of that comment every time I see this prime minister - the hubris of a government overcome with arrogance, where no one is too right-wing or extreme to share a platform with.</p><p>This is the first time I've seen a prime minister stand in this parliament and refer to the statement of a senator, as this one did when asked his view about some of those opposite sharing a platform with Raheem Kassam and Matt Gaetz. The fact is that those opposite have a hide to ask, 'Whose side are you on?' But, in response, let me give them exactly which side Labor is on. </p><p>We're on the side of unity, not division. We're on the side of equality, not inequality. We're on the side of political conviction, not political expediency.

The amount charged when a consumer misses the bill due date can result in a high penalty which can significantly hurt the hip pocket.</p><p>This practice impacts a large number of Australians, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finding, on average, one in four customers did not meet the conditions of their discount. This was even higher for customers in financial hardship, with around 60% missing out on these discounts.</p><p>The rule proposed by this government would limit the conditional discount only to the retailer's reasonable costs. Retailers would also be prevented from penalising customers twice, with both a late payment fee and withdrawal of a pay-on-time discount.</p><p>This proposed rule change builds on action already taken to protect customers and reduce power prices for families and small businesses, including:</p><p> Implementing the Default Market Offer-or price cap-which places a limit on what retailers can charge their electricity standing offer customers;</p><p> Introducing a reference price mechanism, which ensures consumers are able to compare electricity offers against a standard benchmark price; and</p><p> Ensuring vulnerable customers who are experiencing financial hardship get the help they need to pay their power bills.</p><p> The government's Big Stick legislation to prohibit energy market misconduct is also an important reform that aims to end customer ripoffs, hold the big energy companies to account, and drive competition in the market and lower prices for consumers.</p><p>The AEMC is seeking responses to the consultation paper by 19 September 2019, with the view to finalising a rule change determination by the end of February 2020.</p><p>For further information see: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/pyjamapolitics/\">aemc.gov.au</url>. </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.36am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 3.24am BST </p><p>The motion requires the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to inquire into:</p><p>(a) the privatisation of Australia's visa and citizenship program, including:</p><p> (i) the integrity of Australia's visa and citizenship system,</p><p> (ii) the commercial implications and increased costs to industry, with particular regard for the tourism and higher education sectors,</p><p> (iii) the implications to national security, data security and privacy, and</p><p> (iv) the risk to public sector employment - especially rural and regional employment - through service delivery model changes; and</p><p>(b) Centrelink's Robodebt compliance and outsourced debt collection program, including:</p><p> (i) the integrity and impact of the automated debt collection processes,</p><p> (ii) the limitations and impact of Robodebt collection methods,</p><p> (iii) the identification of inaccurate debts - made without human oversight,</p><p> (iv) the impact to public sector employment - especially on the capacity and adequacy of staffing level, and</p><p> (v) the review and appeals process for debt notices; and</p><p>(c) the broader outsourcing of functions in the Human Services portfolio and at the National Disability Insurance Agency, including</p><p> (i) the processes for contracting and tendering under the outsourcing of services;</p><p> (ii) the impact of capped staffing numbers and the efficiency dividend at government departments/agencies.</p><p> (iii) the future planning and preparation for the outsourcing of departmental functions;</p><p> (iv) the impact outsourcing has on service provision; and</p><p> (v) the impact on current public sector employment and the risks to future public sector employment; and</p><p>(d) the outsourcing of security vetting services in the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency, including:</p><p> (i) the processes for contracting and tendering under the outsourcing of services;</p><p> (ii) the impact of capped staffing numbers and the efficiency dividend at government departments/agencies.</p><p> (iii) the future planning and preparation for the outsourcing of departmental functions;</p><p> (iv) the impact outsourcing has on service provision; and</p><p> (v) the impact on current public sector employment and the risks to future public sector employment;</p><p>(e) and related matters.</p><p>block-time published-time 3.24am BST </p><p>The Senate has voted 33 to 29 in favour of Kristina Keneally's  motion to establish an inquiry into the privatisation of the visa system, robodebt and other outsourcing of government services.</p><p>The Home Affairs Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/pyjamapolitics/\">put the visa privatisation process on ice before the election</url> in case Labor       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/pyjamapolitics/\">came into government and killed it, as it threatened</url>.

For example, in 1999 the House of Representatives declined to refer Warren Entsch  to the high court over an alleged pecuniary interest, and instead resolved itself that he was eligible.</p><p>Professor Anne Twomey  thinks it's \"a very hard question\" to resolve. On one view parliament has decided to confer jurisdiction on the court, and limited its own jurisdiction. But on the other hand, Twomey points to some observations by three justices in Sue v Hill  which suggest it could be possible that the court and parliament could come into conflict, offering contradictory views on the eligibility of a member or senator.</p><p>Twomey: \" Even if the House did retain jurisdiction to decide the issue, there is also the convention of 'sub judice' in parliament. That is that the Houses should not debate things that are currently before the courts. It would hence be most inappropriate for a House to decide on a Member's qualification or disqualification once proceedings have been initiated in the court of disputed returns. It would also show a lack of respect for the judicial process. Hence, I don't think it likely that the House would do so.\"</p><p>In any event - the government does not seem keen to try to resolve the issue in parliament.</p><p>Attorney general Christian Porter  said:</p><p>\"All Coalition candidates at the last election were subject to rigorous eligibility checks.</p><p> The government is confident in its members' eligibility and does not need to move a motion on the floor of the House to resolve the issue.\"</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.47am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 1.33am BST </p><p>\"People do know what my values are, I am a progressive, I want to shape change, to move the country forward.

Keneally told the Senate on Wednesday night:</p><p>This is a $5m piece of paper. This is either the single most expensive piece of paper in the history of this chamber or a blatant rejection of the will of the Senate by a minister who is allergic to scrutiny. The community has the right to know how one of our largest government departments - and one that is so fundamental to our national security - is being administered.</p><p>Meanwhile, the government is pushing new legislation to keep \"high-risk terrorist offenders\" in prison, beyond any sentence they may be handed \"if they pose an ongoing threat to public safety\".</p><p>There's no information yet on who judges who is an ongoing threat, or what constitutes that ongoing threat. From Christian Porter's office: </p><p> The changes were recommended by the Council of Australian Governments following a deadly 2017 terror attack in Victoria, which involved an offender who was on bail and had previously been charged with a terrorism offence.</p><p>The community was rightly outraged by Yacqub Khayre's case and I believe the changes we are introducing today strike the right balance between protecting individual rights and freedoms, and protecting the community.</p><p>Plus, there is the ensuring integrity bill heading to the Senate. But that doesn't have the numbers with the crossbench as yet, so it is doubtful it will go anywhere before the break.</p><p>You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and me, who is at least at 15% capacity, so huzzah for that. </p><p>Also - happy horse birthday.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Let's get into it.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.04pm BST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54912520</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPH-71Y1-F021-633J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13828\"/><timeReceived>10:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

She said: \"It's a catastrophe that we have a technology that .\u00a0.\u00a0. [could] remedy some of the greatest ills of the world, and we have a corporate culture so set against upholding its societal responsibilities.\"</p><p>The aim of her proposals, she argued, is to make the digital world reflect the real world, where children are afforded protections and services that reflect their age. \"This is not actually even about content, particularly. It's actually about the orchestrated technology that is treating a child like a data centre instead of like a child.\"</p><p>Kidron said she had long been a \"voice in the woods\" on the issue but had sensed a change recently. \"I'm now a choir in the woods .\u00a0.\u00a0. It's going to be a tipping point and we will get fundamental reform much quicker than other people think.\"</p><p>At The Times and Sunday Times Tech Summit last week, Matt Hancock, the digital minister, said the government was committed to making the internet a \"safe and happy place\" for children, but that Kidron's amendment was \"clunky and effectively unworkable\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-38955434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R0D-DHC1-JCJY-G205-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"415\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 19, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STLL000CVGE</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S RIGHTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000469</classCode><className>MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000401</classCode><className>CORPORATE CULTURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000469</classCode><className>MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

There is a good case, also, for raising the awareness of parents and carers to the dangers which may be involved. </p><p>Baroness Massey of Darwen is a Labour peer </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHV-FVN1-F0JV-84R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><timeReceived>2:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The probes extend down to the state level as well, with dozens of state attorneys general scrutinizing the practices of Facebook and Google in separate cases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The barrage of investigations comes amid broad concerns about the effects of the \"Big Four\" on competition and consumers. The last time that both state and federal levels were investigating a case such as this was in 2001-the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case involving the latter's alleged monopoly on the PC market. Those probes, however, were only focused on one company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If it's not unprecedented, it's something that hasn't happened in many decades,\" John E. Lopatka, an antitrust scholar and a distinguished professor of law at Pennsylvania State University's Dickinson School of Law, told The Epoch Times.</p><p>\"It is unusual in terms of both the scope and number of companies under investigation, as well as the intensity of the investigation,\" Lopatka, who previously served as the assistant director for planning for the Bureau of Competition at the FTC, said in a phone call. \"I don't think we've seen anything like that in at least the last 50, 60 years.\"</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is expected to complete a final report on its findings by the \"first part\" of 2020, the committee's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), told reporters on Oct. 18. Leaders of the committee and its subcommittee on antitrust have demanded the four companies turn over a wide range of documents including sensitive internal emails from the companies' top executives as well as detailed financial information, among other company records.</p><p>Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr said on Dec. 10 he hoped to have the DOJ investigations completed \"some time next year.\" In July, the department announced that its antitrust division is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>The DOJ said it will probe concerns related to \"search, social media, and some retail services online.\"</p><p>\"It's been moving very quickly,\" Barr told the Wall Street Journal CeO Council. \"We're talking very broadly with people and getting a lot of input from people in the industry and experts and so forth.\"</p><p>\"I'd like to have it completed some time next year. I think it's important to move quickly on things,\" Barr continued. \"These things have a cost to the marketplace and businesses. I think at some point, the government has to fish or cut bait.\"</p><p>At an early hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the four companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly, yet vigorously, against rivals in the marketplace. Cicilline said he was dissatisfied with answers the executives gave to lawmakers, calling their testimony \"evasive.\"</p><p>It's \"very unusual\" to have simultaneous investigations by the DOJ and the FTC, Eleanor Fox, professor of trade regulation at New York University School of Law, told The Epoch Times. The state-level probes are equally unconventional, added Fox, who is an expert in antitrust policy.</p><p>\"It's not unusual that you have state attorneys general that are also investigating, but it's very unusual that you have so many of them on board for investigating,\" she said. \"But the most unusual thing is the FTC and the DOJ are apparently investigating the same thing at the same time.\"</p><p>The attorneys general of 48 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have opened an antitrust probe into Google and the company's \"potential monopolistic behavior.\" The investigation is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who formally made the announcement on Sept. 9.</p><p>At the same time, a probe of Facebook led by New York has since expanded to include attorneys general from 47 U.S. states and territories.</p><p>It's not just agencies within the United States that are scrutinizing big tech behavior. Antitrust regulators from the EU are considering taking a tougher stance against the Big Four, Cecilio Madero Villarejo, acting director-general of the European Commission's competition division said in October.</p><p>Traditionally, the commission has just ordered companies to stop their anticompetitive practices but Villarejo said that may not be enough:</p><p>\"In fast-moving markets, there is a risk that this would take too long to implement and be too difficult to monitor,\" Villarejo told a CRA conference.</p><p>Potential Actions</p><p>Rohit Chopra, an FTC commissioner, said at an October hearing that vast troves of consumer data collected by big tech allow them to gain a competitive edge and pose a threat to competition, by creating market entry barriers. Personal data is powering the dominance of tech companies that offer \"free\" basic services that are, ultimately, not free, he said.</p><p>Chopra also said the usual financial penalties won't be enough to address concerns over the power of big tech firms, adding that regulators will need to take a closer look.</p><p>New York attorney Barry Barnett, who has expertise in antitrust law, told The Epoch Times in September that the House probe could \"potentially bring enforcement actions to halt or reverse acquisitions if they have created or sustained monopolies or aimed to do so.\"</p><p>Barnett also wondered if investigators are interested in moving away from a \"narrow consumer-welfare approach\" to one of \"antitrust enforcement.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump, in the meantime, has accused big tech companies such as Facebook and Google of suppressing and censoring political speech, particularly conservative speech.</p><p>The timing of the new probes is interesting, New York-based corporate attorney Manny Alicandro told The Epoch Times previously. The vocal and online pressure from Trump against big tech is \"making it newsworthy to the extent that it's very topical.\" But Alicandro also stressed that the probes are based on merit and should \"not be viewed as politically motivated.\"</p><p>\"This is historic scrutiny, because it's bipartisan,\" Alicandro said. \"There's a lot at stake in terms of how much these entities-these big tech companies-control and how they disseminate information.\"</p><p>\"Depending on the results ... it could have a material impact on these companies right now and similar companies going forward,\" he added.</p><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told Reuters in October that his agency is concerned about corporate consolidation. His state is leading a fight to stop T-Mobile US from buying Sprint. If states can successfully block such deals, he said it would send a message that \"antitrust enforcers will be back in the driver's seat.\"</p><p>It is unusual in terms of both the scope and number of companies under investigation, as well as the intensity of the investigation.</p><p>John Lopatka, antitrust scholar and distinguished professor of law, Dickinson School of Law, Pennsylvania State University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2335164640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYW-HPS1-DYR7-80D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 606</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>PENN STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Barr on Wednesday blasted big tech, raising the specter that Silicon Valley might soon be held accountable for a wide array of dangerous, harmful content that critics say has flourished on their sites and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At an event that laid bare tech's broad troubles - including the spread of terrorism, illicit drug sales, and child sexual exploitation online - Barr said it may be time for the government to seek sweeping changes to a key portion of federal law, known as Section 230, that long has spared tech companies from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p>''No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,'' Barr said in a speech, reflecting on the origin of the statute. ''They have become titans.''</p><p>Barr's shot at Silicon Valley offers the latest evidence that regulators in Washington - Democrats and Republicans alike - believe some of the federal safeguards that helped incubate the Internet have become hinderances, preventing law enforcement and aggrieved Web users from obtaining justice when people are harmed.</p><p>For all their ability to connect people across borders, Facebook, Google, and other popular sites and services also have served as conduits for hate speech and extremism. They've unwittingly housed graphic, viral videos of recent mass shootings, including the deadly attack in Christchurch, New Zealand last year. They've become marketplaces for the sale or promotion of guns, drugs, and fake medical cures. And they've been weaponized to spread misinformation and undermine elections, including in the United States.</p><p>Often, they're able to dodge direct punishment even when their technologies are used to enhance the reach of such harmful material.</p><p>Lobbyists from Facebook, Google, and other online platforms have fought vigorously to protect their prized legal shield, arguing it actually gives them legal cover to do the sort of content moderation governments seek - without being sued for the decisions they make about the posts they leave up or take down.</p><p>But Barr - who cautioned he had not come to a final position on whether Section 230 should be significantly revised or repealed - still highlighted its ''expansive reach,'' a comment that could encourage members of Congress who have floated similar suggestions about changes to the law.</p><p>''The department has the responsibility to keep up with changes in technology to protect our citizens from these new harms, while at the same time preserving the benefits of this new technology,'' the attorney general said.</p><p>The Justice Department has been exploring Section 230 as part of a wide-ranging probe of Facebook, Google, and other companies, an inquiry that's also studied whether those firms have become too big, powerful, and anti-competitive. DOJ officials have signaled they plan to put forward recommendations - and potentially bring individual cases against companies - before the end of the year.</p><p>Amid withering criticism, many in the industry have emphasized their recent work to improve their policies, hire more people to review content, and take swifter, more aggressive action to ensure users aren't harmed.</p><p>Yet their assurances have failed to assuage regulators even beyond Washington: Throughout the European Union, for example, policymakers have contemplated a raft of fines and other punishments in the event Facebook, Google, and their peers fail to prevent or disable dangerous posts, photos, and videos in real time.</p><p>The regulatory threat has grown so dire that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg even paid a rare visit to Brussels on Monday. Ahead of his visit with EU officials, the social-networking giant articulated its own beliefs about regulation, arguing in a white paper that laws that ''punish the publication of illegal speech are unsuitable for the internet landscape.''</p><p>But the idea appeared to find an icy reception among the European Commission, where some members have pushed the social-networking giant to play a more active, aggressive role in policing the Web for harm.</p><p>''Facebook cannot push away all the responsibility,'' Vera Jourova, the EU vice president for values and transparency, told reporters.</p><p>In Washington, meanwhile, top officials on Wednesday sought to make their own case about the need for Facebook, Google, and their peers - with vast reach and once-unfathomable profits - to be held accountable for their role in facilitating the spread of dangerous posts, photos, and videos.</p><p>''We're constantly reminded that the same technology that facilitates free speech, connect with our loved ones and our friends and enriches our lives, can pose serious dangers,'' said FBI Director Christopher Wray to open an event on Section 230.</p><p>''Certainly, more can be done,'' responded Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, in a later panel discussion. The group represents Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies, and joined a daylong session convened by the Justice Department focused on the future of the law.</p><p>''But I don't think we should assume the misconduct of a few bad actors is generalizable across a large industry,'' Schruers added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>'No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts.

Barr on Wednesday blasted big tech, raising the specter that Silicon Valley might soon be held accountable for a wide array of dangerous, harmful content that critics say has flourished on their sites and services. At an event that laid bare tech's broad troubles \u2014 including the spread of terrorism, illicit drug sales and child sexual exploitation online \u2014 Barr said it may be time for the government to seek sweeping changes to a key portion of federal law, known as Section 230, that long has spared tech companies from liability for content posted by their users. \"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Barr said in a speech, reflecting on the origin of the statute. \"They have become titans.\" </p><p>Barr's shot at Silicon Valley offers the latest evidence that regulators in Washington \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 believe some of the federal safeguards that helped incubate the Internet have become hinderances, preventing law enforcement and aggrieved web users from obtaining justice when people are harmed. For all their ability to connect people across borders, Facebook, Google and other popular sites and services also have served as conduits for hate speech and extremism. They've unwittingly housed graphic, viral videos of recent mass shootings, including the deadly attack in Christchurch, New Zealand last year. They've become marketplaces for the sale or promotion of guns, drugs and fake medical cures. And they've been weaponized to spread misinformation and undermine elections, including in the United States. Often, they're able to dodge direct punishment even when their technologies are used to enhance the reach of such harmful material. Lobbyists from Facebook, Google and other online platforms have fought vigorously to protect their prized legal shield, arguing it actually gives them legal cover to do the sort of content moderation governments seek \u2014 without being sued for the decisions they make about the posts they leave up or take down. But Barr \u2014 who cautioned he had not come to a final position on whether Section 230 should be significantly revised or repealed \u2014 still highlighted its \"expansive reach,\" a comment that could encourage members of Congress who have floated similar suggestions about changes to the law. \"The department has the responsibility to keep up with changes in technology to protect our citizens from these new harms, while at the same time preserving the benefits of this new technology,\" the attorney general said. The Justice Department has been exploring Section 230 as part of a wide-ranging probe of Facebook, Google and other companies, an inquiry that's also studied whether those firms have become too big, powerful and anti-competitive. DOJ officials have signaled they plan to put forward recommendations - and potentially bring individual cases against companies - before the end of the year. Amid withering criticism, many in the industry have emphasized their recent work to improve their policies, hire more people to review content and take swifter, more aggressive action to ensure users aren't harmed. Yet their assurances have failed to assuage regulators even beyond Washington: Throughout the European Union, for example, policymakers have contemplated a raft of fines and other punishments in the event Facebook, Google and their peers fail to prevent or disable dangerous posts, photos and videos in real time. The regulatory threat has grown so dire that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg even paid a rare visit to Brussels on Monday. Ahead of his visit with EU officials, the social-networking giant articulated its own beliefs about regulation, arguing in a white paper that laws that \"punish the publication of illegal speech are unsuitable for the internet landscape.\" But the idea appeared to find an icy reception among the European Commission, where some members have pushed the social-networking giant to play a more active, aggressive role in policing the web for harm. \"Facebook cannot push away all the responsibility,\" Vera Jourova, the EU vice president for values and transparency, told reporters. In Washington, meanwhile, top officials on Wednesday sought to make their own case about the need for Facebook, Google and their peers \u2014 with vast reach and once-unfathomable profits -to be held accountable for their role in facilitating the spread of dangerous posts, photos and videos. \"We're constantly reminded that the same technology that facilitates free speech, connect with our loved ones and our friends and enriches our lives, can pose serious dangers,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray to open an event on Section 230. \"Certainly, more can be done,\" responded Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, in a later panel discussion. The group represents Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies, and joined a day-long session convened by the Justice Department focused on the future of the law. \"But I don't think we should assume the misconduct of a few bad actors is generalizable across a large industry,\" Schruers added. Carrie Goldberg, an attorney who specializes in sexual privacy violations, offered one example of the potential harm from her own case work: A plaintiff whose ex repeatedly created fake profiles of him on Grindr, a gay dating app, putting him at risk for assault. The ex would \"post my client's geographic information, and then send people\" to his home and workplace, looking for sex, Goldberg said. The plaintiff repeatedly flagged the issue to Grindr, to no avail, and a subsequent lawsuit fell short of holding the company accountable in court. Grindr prevailed by invoking Section 230, she said. \"They see Section 230, and all the case law over the past few decades. . . as a pass,\" Goldberg continued, \"and take no action whatsoever.\" barr-tech-1stld-writethru</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001152026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-2311-JBRC-V2T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has extraordinary implications for the reputation of the FBI. It's not clear yet exactly when the report will be released today - so do stay glued. It is expected to find that the intelligence community did have enough legitimate evidence in 2016 of links between Donald Trump's campaign and Russian operatives seeking to interfere in his favor to obtain secret surveillance warrants. There was no illegal spying and that outweighs some secondary findings that there was some sloppiness and political bias on display from some FBI figures.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Beginning within minutes, at 9am ET, the House of Representatives' judiciary committee will hold its second public hearing in the impeachment inquiry against the president. The congressional lawyers Daniel Goldman and Stephen Castor will be the witnesses, discussing the grounds for impeachment found by the intelligence committee in recent weeks. Expect stormy waters and a long hearing. We now move from the inquiry phase into the process for the Democratic controlled committee to draw up the articles of impeachment (effectively the indictment against Trump), to be voted on by the House before Christmas and leading to a congressional trial in the Senate early next year. Of special note: will the committee include obstruction of the Mueller report (the product of the Trump-Russia investigation) in the articles?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Democratic 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren says an all-women ticket in the election can beat Donald Trump.

Those PCs might contain toxic materials such as lead, cadmium and mercury.</p><p>Only about 10% of PCs in the U.S. are recycled, according to figures from the Grass Roots Recycling Network.</p><p>Rethink wants to raise U.S. awareness of the problem and provide tips on what to do with old PCs and related gear.</p><p>Jammin' With Tyler, Redford</p><p>Intel is a major eBay partner in the effort. Intel Chief Executive Craig Barrett agrees with Whitman that PC garbage is getting out of hand.</p><p>He mentioned the initiative in an opening keynote address at the CES on Thursday. While he didn't disclose any new products or initiatives during his address, Barrett spoke of the importance of the emerging \"entertainment PC,\" personal computers designed to play movies, games and music. So it was only natural that a few celebrities from the entertainment world helped him make his points.</p><p>Joining him during his speech were Steven Tyler, lead singer of rock group Aerosmith, and actor/director Robert Redford.</p><p>Tyler came onstage to talk about new software that lets consumers remix songs. Redford, founder of the Sundance Film Festival, talked about how some new tech gadgets are helping make movies.</p><p>Barrett spoke of the digital home as a continuing major tech trend. \"And the entertainment PC,\" he said, \"will be the bedrock of the digital home.\"</p><p>FCC To Rule On TV Transition</p><p>The lack of a hard cutoff date for analog TV is hampering the transition to digital television, FCC Chairman Michael Powell said at a show session Thursday.</p><p>Powell said Congress set an ambiguous deadline. The congressional mandate called for shutting off analog TV signals at the end of 2006 and returning that spectrum to the government for other services. But 85% of TV households must have access to digital TV before that can happen.</p><p>Now the commission has to interpret the mandate, Powell said.</p><p>\"This will come to a head in one form or another in 2005,\" he said. \"The problem has been avoided for years because 2006 looked really far away.\"</p><p>Consumers, broadcasters and consumer electronics companies would all benefit from a clear cutoff date, Powell said.</p><p>Though nowhere near 85%, the digital television transition is going \"quite well, better than people expected\" after being \"moribund\" two-plus years ago, he said.</p><p>Microsoft, The \"Friendly' Empire</p><p>Companies used to be leery about partnering with Microsoft.

The pharma and medtech industries operate within a complex  environment, with a multitude of stakeholders and interfaces from patients, to healthcare professionals, to payers. The combination of large data sets  and the need for seamless interaction across multiple interfaces makes them an obvious choice for digital strategies. However, for obvious reasons related to public health, this is also a highly regulated industry, and regulation has slowed down the digital disruption here compared to other industries (e.g., logistics or automotive).</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The big tech companies are predictable.

Most of them have set up digital centers of excellence and hired digital talents to start building their own digital healthcare solutions. Today, nobody really doubts that digitization has already reached the healthcare sector. Having collected the first experiences in this area themselves, we asked the digital leaders the question \"what comes next?\" We wanted to understand what the current status is and what the barriers to Digital@Scale were. We discussed the following questions:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How do you make sure digital initiatives connect to each other, creating advantages beyond solving individual problems?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How do you handle the talent challenge? </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What is your experience with transferring digital initiatives from an incubator setting into the line organization?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Current initiatives on building Digital@Scale</h><p>In a survey on the status of digital strategy, it became clear that all pharma and medtech companies in our sample have worked on their digital strategy; many have kicked off pilots or prototype development projects. The assessment of the maturity of their digital strategies, however, revealed stagnation: goals and objectives of the digital strategy (the \"what\") seem to be in place, but there are challenges in defining a clear path toward the operational implementation (the \"how\") (see Exhibit 1).</p><p>In discussions with our expert panel,  we discovered that there is an increasing sense of urgency at most companies and a strong feeling that digital is important and that digitization needs to be incorporated into the overall business strategy. Yet, there is currently very little evidence of Digital@Scale in the companies we talked to.</p><p>The likely root cause is that pharma and medtech companies still have to put the basic building blocks in place to drive Digital@Scale. While we saw favorable responses to questions in the areas of \"capabilities of experimentation\" and \"roles and responsibilities in digital,\" the answers to the \"company culture\" and \"technology foundation\" questions were rather sobering.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>Protoypes at speed are worthless if culture and willingness to scale are lacking.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Our survey asked participants for the five building blocks of a digital business model, from digital strategy to culture. While the majority of the respondents (65 percent) had a strategy in place, the \"softer\" components needed for higher \"digital maturity\" were present only in a minority of the surveyed companies. Only 10 percent said that digital culture is not an issue for them.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Pharmaceuticals and Medical Products/Our Insights/Barriers to Digital at Scale Shifting the focus from tech to culture/SVGZ-Barriers-to-Digital-at-Scale-Ex1.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><h>Barriers to Digital@Scale</h><p>When we asked questions about what works well and where the companies hit barriers, it became clear that technical components-such as cloud platforms, data management, multi-channel environment, etc.-and even budgeting and resourcing are no longer considered much of an issue. Instead, topics typically associated with change management are becoming the biggest challenge (see Exhibit 2). </p><p>In general, our experts felt that the uptake of digitization was too slow and that leadership in their respective companies was rather conservative when it came to embracing new technologies. When asked about the main barriers, the three areas that were most frequently mentioned were culture and mindset, organizational structure and governance, and hiring the right talent.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Pharmaceuticals and Medical Products/Our Insights/Barriers to Digital at Scale Shifting the focus from tech to culture/SVGZ-Barriers-to-Digital-at-Scale-Ex2.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><h>Enabling Digital@Scale</h><p>The challenge of digitization is no longer one of technological capability, but one of governance, culture, and talent. This is a clear indication that companies need to shift their focus from incubators and initiatives and start thinking about using a change management approach to scale their digital strategies.</p><p>To enable this, digital strategy needs to become not only part of the vision and mission of a company, but also a part of the ways of working and the organization at all levels of the company. Only by making digital an integral part of the culture at all levels will it be possible to scale up prototypes to fully fledged business models. To be achieved, this must not only be communicated as a priority for IT and HR, but as a priority for all functions. It must also be driven from the top and by leadership in all areas, whether they are leaders in medical/R&amp;D, marketing, or operations.</p><p>In summary, we find that all pharma and medtech companies have started to work on their digital strategy, and many have developed prototypes or run pilot projects. Scaling up those small efforts requires an effort to change in culture and mindset, because Digital@Scale requires buy-in not only from the senior leadership but from the middle management as well. This need for strong leadership makes Digital@Scale a CEO and leadership team topic.

Other featured articles look at how to play rising gold prices or China's comeback, and how not to get burned by thematic ETFs. Also, the prospects for car dealer stocks, the breakup of big tech, office REITs and more.Cover story \"SPACs Are the New Hot Thing on Wall Street. </p><p>What You Need to Know[2]\" by Nicholas Jasinski explains that blank-check companies give investors an opportunity to ride along with dealmakers looking to bring new businesses public, such as Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA[3]) and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE: SPCE[4]). Andrew Bary's \"Gold Prices Are on the Rise. Here Are the Ways to Play It[5]\" makes a case that there could be more room for gold and gold-mining stocks to advance. See if Barron's thinks Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: GOLD[6]) is worth a look. In \"Park These 3 Car Dealer Stocks in Your Portfolio[7],\" Daren Fonda shows why car-buyers have gravitated toward online platforms, but for investors, the better deals are still at the lot. Why investors should consider AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN[8]) and others. What the United States can learn from China's revival, according to \"How to Invest in China's Consumer Comeback[9]\" by Reshma Kapadia. Travel is out, but e-commerce, such as JD.Com Inc (NYSE: JD[10]), is among the areas that are thriving. In Bill Alpert's \"2 Picks and 4 Pans From a Savvy Pro[11],\" the founder of an independent research firm shares his thoughts on what to expect from the likes of Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ: OSTK[12]) and Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ: ZG[13]). See also: TikTok Is On The Clock As Trump Threatens Ban, Microsoft Mulls Acquisition[14] \"Congress' Grilling of Tech Titans Didn't Rattle Their Shares. Here's Why[15]\" by Max A. Cherney takes a look at how likely breakups of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[16]) and other tech giants are after last week's testimony by their chiefs. Niche exchange-traded funds, such as First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NYSE: SKYY[17]), invest in targeted areas. That's a huge benefit\u2014until it's not. So says Evie Liu's \"Thematic ETFs Invest In the Hottest Trends. How Not To Get Burned.[18]\" In \"Because Working From Home Is Hot, You'll Need to Do Your Homework on Office REITs[19],\" Lawrence C. Strauss suggests that investors can still find potential winners among these real estate investment trusts. Is Cousins Properties Inc (NYSE: CUZ[20]) one of them? Also in this week's Barron's:Whether investors are too wary as earnings come in strong How big tech CEOs got the last word Robo advisors pass their first stress test What to watch instead of gross domestic product Why bitcoin is rising againAt the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.

Other featured articles present the annual ranking of top fund families, examine regulatory issues at tech giants and review the performance of former Dividend Aristocrats. Also, the prospects for two natural gas picks, a leading cryptocurrency and more. </p><p> Cover story \"Inside Berkshire Hathaway's Future Without Warren Buffett[2]\" by Andrew Bary makes a case that as the Oracle of Omaha turns 90 this year, the company he built, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NASDAQ: BRK-A[3]), could be in for a stock-boosting makeover. Sarah Max's \"Barron's Top Fund Families of 2019[4]\" shares why MFS Investment Management was the big winner in the Barron's annual ranking of how the industry performed in its actively managed mutual and exchange-traded funds. In \"Avoid Natural Gas Stocks Except for These 2 Names[5],\" Avi Salzman points out that most natural-gas stocks look like dismal investments as gas prices plummet. See why Barron's saysCabot Corp (NYSE: CBT[6]) and one other pick may buck that trend. Regulators and presidential candidates are calling out big tech companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[7]), but self-imposed checks could be even more painful for the industry, according to \"Big Tech's Regulatory Problems Go Deeper Than You Think[8]\" by Eric J. Savitz. In Lawrence C. Strauss's \"When Dividend Aristocrats Lose Their Status, Their Returns Often Improve[9],\" see why the post-Aristocrat performance of some companies is solid, and some resume raising dividends after their membership infraction. Does that include U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB[10])? See also: 7 Ways To Invest In Gold Amid Coronavirus Fears[11] \"When Will Bitcoin Go Full Tesla?[12]\" by Jack Hough discusses how Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA[13]) stock has just had the ride of its life, and Bitcoin could be next as the cryptocurrency approaches a signal that in the past has led to new highs. Aurora Cannabis Inc (NYSE: ACB[14]) and other big North American cannabis companies could burn through their cash balances in months unless they can raise funds or cut spending. So says Bill Alpert and Connor Smith's \"Marijuana Companies Could Burn Through Cash in Months[15].\" In \"There's No Doubt Roku Is Growing Fast. But Analysts Are Split on the Stock[16],\" Nicholas Jasinski suggests that though the latest results from Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU[17]) blew past their expectations, analysts still must weigh its rapid growth and large, still-untapped market against the stock's rich valuation.

Other featured articles examine tech giants under scrutiny and the case for infrastructure stocks. Also:the prospects for a recent IPO and a struggling specialty retailer. </p><p>\"JPMorgan Is a Solid Bet Under Jamie Dimon[2]\" by Andrew Bary shows why Warren Buffett loves JPMorgan Chase .... (NYSE: JPM[3]) stock and investors should too. See why Barron's calls it the best-run U.S. bank in an out-of-favor sector. In \"Breaking Down Big Tech's Antitrust Regulation Risk[4],\" Tae Kim points out that tech shares sold off sharply on reports of potential antitrust investigations into the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[5]) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB[6]). Time to panic? Lawrence Strauss'\"Why Dividend Investors Should Buy Infrastructure Stocks[7]\" makes a case for infrastructure firms like American Tower Corp (NYSE: AMT[8]) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE: NSC[9]) to increase their dividends by 5 percentor more. Despite positive analyst sentiment and a surge that has the shares finally back at the IPO price, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER[10]) is still a long way away from profitability, according to \"Uber Stock Is Back. Don't Let It Take You for a Ride[11]\" by Connor Smith. In Eric Savitz's \"GameStop Has Become the Poster Child for Retail Woes and Tech Disruption[12],\" see why the problems at GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME[13]) go well beyond being a brick-and-mortar retailer in the age of Amazon. Also in this week's Barron's:Preparing for lower interest rates How the 2020 campaign is already shaping the stock market How to argue about the economy and always be right Why there aren't more women advisors What's next for the marijuana marketAt the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.

Other featured articles discuss big tech's take on banking and retailers that have been left behind. Also, the prospects for a medical devices maker, a financial services play, a retail giant still growing and more.\"How to Generate Income in Retirement With Dividend Stocks[2]\" by Lawrence C. Strauss examines why investors turning to equities with cash payouts, like Johnson ...hnson (NYSE: JNJ[3]) and JPMorgan Chase .... (NYSE: JPM[4]), for their nest eggs can carry risk if not done right. </p><p>Jack Hough's \"Medtronic Stock Could Rise Even More on Plans to Sell a Lot More Pacemakers[5]\" makes a case that the potential market for a tiny cardiac device from Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT[6]) could more than triple if regulators approve new use. In \"Here's a Financial Services Stock That Should Work Even in a Down Market[7],\" Nicholas Jasinski suggests that Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR[8]) dominates the business of investor communications, and its model works in good times and bad. By some estimates, Americans spend $200 billion a year on takeout meals. Yet, the companies doing the delivery, such as GrubHub Inc (NYSE: GRUB[9]), make almost no profit, according to \"In Food Delivery, It's Eat or Be Eaten[10]\" by Eric J. Savitz. In Steven M. Sears's \"The Time to Trade Tesla Is Now[11],\" check out how aggressive investors with an appetite for risk could sell a put and buy a call in anticipation that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TLSA[12]) shares will make a sharp move after the company unveils its pickup truck offering. See Also: Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Apple, Disney, Microsoft, Uber And More[13] \"Big Tech Promised to Reinvent Banking. It Didn't.[14]\" by Jack Hough shows why companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL[15]) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL[16]) are learning that beating the big banks in fintech isn't so easy. So instead, they're joining them. In \"Retail's Left-Behinds[17],\" Nicholas Jasinski points out that the narrative of the rise of e-commerce and shifting consumer behavior has been complicated by tariffs and a potentially peaking economy. What's that mean for the likes of Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD[18]) and Macy's Inc (NYSE: M[19])? While it's reasonable that investors have grown concerned about this retail giant's rich valuation, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT[20]), with its e-commerce initiatives, still has a lot of growing ahead of it. So says Ben Levisohn's \"Walmart Might Be Pricey, but There's Lots of Growth Ahead[21].\" 0   2019 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Barr on Wednesday blasted Big Tech, raising the specter that Silicon Valley might soon be held accountable for a wide array of dangerous, harmful content that critics say has flourished on their sites and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At an event that laid bare tech's broad troubles \" including the spread of terrorism, illicit drug sales and child sexual exploitation online \" Barr said it may be time for the government to seek sweeping changes to a key portion of federal law, known as Section 230, that long has spared tech companies from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p>'No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,' Barr said in a speech, reflecting on the origin of the statute. 'They have become titans.'</p><p>Barr's shot at Silicon Valley offers the latest evidence that regulators in Washington \" Democrats and Republicans alike \" believe some of the federal safeguards that helped incubate the Internet have become hindrances, preventing law enforcement and aggrieved users from obtaining justice when people are harmed.</p><p>For all their ability to connect people across borders, Facebook, Google, and other popular sites and services also have served as conduits for hate speech and extremism. </p><p>They've unwittingly housed graphic, viral videos of recent mass shootings, including the deadly attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year. They've become marketplaces for the sale or promotion of guns, drugs and fake medical cures. And they've been weaponized to spread misinformation and undermine elections, including in the United States. Often, they're able to dodge direct punishment even when their technologies are used to enhance the reach of such harmful material.</p><p>Lobbyists from Facebook, Google and other online platforms have fought vigorously to protect their prized legal shield, arguing it actually gives them cover to do the sort of content moderation that governments seek \" without being sued for the decisions they make about the posts they leave up or take down.</p><p>But Barr \" who cautioned that he had not come to a final position on whether Section 230 should be significantly revised or repealed \" highlighted its 'expansive reach,' a comment that could encourage members of Congress who have floated similar suggestions about changes to the law.</p><p>'The department has the responsibility to keep up with changes in technology to protect our citizens from these new harms, while at the same time preserving the benefits of this new technology,' the attorney general said.</p><p>The Justice Department has been exploring Section 230 as part of a wide-ranging probe of Facebook, Google and other companies, an inquiry that's also studied whether those firms have become too big, powerful and anti-competitive. Justice officials have signaled they plan to put forward recommendations \" and potentially bring individual cases against companies \" before the end of the year.</p><p>Amid withering criticism, many in the industry have emphasized their recent work to improve their policies, hire more people to review content and take swifter, more aggressive action to ensure users aren't harmed. Yet their assurances have failed to assuage regulators even beyond Washington: Throughout the European Union, for example, policymakers have contemplated a raft of fines and other punishments in the event Facebook, Google and their peers fail to prevent or disable dangerous posts, photos and videos in real time.</p><p>The regulatory threat has grown so dire that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg paid a rare visit to Brussels on Monday. Ahead of his visit with E.U. officials, the social-networking giant articulated its position on regulation, arguing in a white paper that laws that 'punish the publication of illegal speech are unsuitable for the internet landscape.'</p><p>In Washington, top officials on Wednesday sought to make their own case about the need for Facebook, Google and their peers \" with vast reach and once unfathomable profits \" to be held accountable for their role in facilitating the spread of dangerous posts, photos and videos.</p><p>'We're constantly reminded that the same technology that facilitates free speech, connects with our loved ones and our friends and enriches our lives can pose serious dangers,' FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said to open an event on Section 230.</p><p>'Certainly, more can be done,' Matt Schruers, president of the Computer - Communications Industry Association, responded in a later panel discussion. The group represents Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies and joined a day-long session convened by the Justice Department focused on the future of the law.</p><p>'But I don't think we should assume the misconduct of a few bad actors is generalizable across a large industry,' Schruers added.</p><p>Carrie Goldberg, an attorney who specializes in sexual privacy violations, offered one example of the potential harm from her own case work: A plaintiff whose ex repeatedly created fake profiles of him on Grindr, a gay dating app, putting him at risk for assault.</p><p>The ex would 'post my client's geographic information, and then send people' to his home and workplace, looking for sex, Goldberg said.

The act, which was passed in 1996, states that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Online companies such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter are protected by Section 230 as it largely exempts them from liability involving content posted by users of their platforms, although they can be held liable for content that violates criminal or intellectual property law.</p><p>\"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts; they have become titans of U.S. industry,\" Barr said. \"Given this changing technological landscape, valid questions have been raised on whether Section 230's broad immunity is still necessary, at least in its current form.\"</p><p>Some of Barr's concerns relate to the apparent stretching of the statute's original purpose. He said the statute's immunity has since been extended to conduct such as \"selling illegal or faulty products to connecting terrorists to facilitating child exploitation.\"</p><p>\"Online services also have invoked immunity even where they solicited or encouraged unlawful conduct, shared in illegal proceeds, or helped perpetrators hide from law enforcement,\" Barr said.</p><p>New York attorney Barry Barnett, an antitrust law expert, told The Epoch Times that Barr's remarks about the scope of the statute indicate the administration's willingness \"to use a broad array of legal tools to address harms it attributes to big tech platforms.\"</p><p>The Justice Department is \"concerned about the expansive reach of Section 230\" Barr said, but it won't advocate for a specific position on the matter.</p><p>In December 2019, the 9th Circuit held that the statute doesn't protect a firm from antitrust liability if its decisions about \"blocking and filtering\" content \"are driven by anticompetitive animus,\" according to Barnett. He said in the future, he expects the Justice Department's Antitrust Division to support rulings similar to the one made by the 9th Circuit, in light of Barr's comments.</p><p>Ashley N. Baker, director of Public Policy at the Committee for Justice, meanwhile warned that any proposed government solutions to the issues with Section 230 \"are worse than the problem.\"</p><p>\"Calling for top-down intervention by the government into social media content would give bureaucrats immense control over online speech,\" Baker said via email. \"While I understand that there is legitimate concern over how broadly the statute is applied in court, I think that we need to carefully think this through, particularly from the perspectives of government power, platform incentives, and lawsuit abuse.\"</p><p>Baker, whose focus areas include the Supreme Court, technology, and regulatory policy, said that without the statute, \"platforms would have strong incentives to heavily moderate content.\"</p><p>\"Companies such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube would be unlikely to face penalties for taking content down, but could face an avalanche oflawsuits for leaving it up,\" she said.</p><p>Barr's comments offered insight into how regulators in Washington are reconsidering the need for incentives that once helped online companies grow but are increasingly viewed as impediments to curbing online crime, harassment, and extremism.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Feb. 15 that Facebook should be viewed as \"somewhere in between\" a newspaper and a telecommunications company, in relation to content. Zuckerberg said Facebook should be regulated in that same regard and that technology companies shouldn't be compared with traditional news outlets, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The interest in Section 230 came as part of a \"broader review of market-leading online platforms,\" according to Barr. In July 2019, the department announced that its antitrust division is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>\"Big tech\" is facing an unprecedented number of antitrust investigations, with four major multinational technology companies- Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple-receiving a level of scrutiny not seen in decades. A congressional committee and subcommittee are investigating all four, even as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are reviewing one or more ofthe companies.</p><p>Lawmakers from both major political parties have called for Congress to change Section 230 in ways that could expose tech companies to more lawsuits or significantly increase their costs.</p><p>Reuters contributed to this report.</p><p>Online services also have invoked immunity even where they solicited or encouraged unlawful conduct, shared in illegal proceeds, or helped perpetrators hide from law enforcement.</p><p>Attorney General William Barr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2389735997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPS-GS21-JC85-J1MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 646</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Barr.</p><p>The day-to-day digging of a federal antitrust investigation rarely rises to the level of the attorney general or the deputy attorney general.</p><p>But under Mr. Barr, the agency has made top priority of looking into the country\u2019s biggest tech companies. He receives regular updates on the Google case from an aide, according to several people close to the investigations, while an official in the office of his deputy, Jeffrey Rosen, oversees the investigations into tech companies.</p><p>In the latest sign that the Justice Department is moving swiftly, staff members appear to have begun drafting a case memo to test its legal argument, three other people connected to the case said. The agency has assigned a growing number of employees to the inquiry, and it has brought in an economic expert who could testify at a trial. The details of the internal maneuvers were gathered from interviews with more than 20 people, most of whom would speak only anonymously because the deliberations were private.</p><p>The attention from top officials shows the high stakes for the Justice Department and Mr. Barr, and may draw fire from critics who say it shows how the agency has become politicized. President Trump has repeatedly chastised the big tech companies, arguing in part that they silence conservative views. On Wednesday, a lawyer for the department, testifying as a whistle-blower, told the House Judiciary Committee that the agency had pursued antitrust investigations either because of Mr. Barr\u2019s personal animus against an industry or the president\u2019s political whims.</p><p>Mr. Barr, who has repeatedly said publicly that the tech industry\u2019s power required examination, is expected to decide in the coming months whether to file a lawsuit accusing Google of abusing its power in the market for advertising technology and search products. A successful suit against the company could win plaudits from Mr. Trump. It could also reshape Google\u2019s business, transform a large chunk of the economy and perhaps even end the era of unfettered growth in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But a loss in court could embarrass the Justice Department \u2014 which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">suffered an antitrust defeat in 2018</url> when it challenged AT&amp;amp;T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner \u2014 and lead to accusations that the case was based on politics, not the law. It could also reinforce the tech industry\u2019s power.</p><p>Deciding not to pursue the case may prove problematic, too: The Federal Trade Commission faced a flood of criticism in 2012 when it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">decided not to sue Google</url>.</p><p>\u201cI think the prevailing winds right now are winds that would result in more criticism if they decided not to bring a case than if they brought a weak case and lost,\u201d said Charles James, who led the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division in the early 2000s.</p><p>Brianna Herlihy, a department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the tech investigations. In a separate statement, she said the agency \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the claims of politicization made at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.</p><p>Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman, said the company continued to cooperate with the Justice Department, \u201cand we don\u2019t have any updates or comments on speculation.\u201d</p><p>The Google investigation began last year, shortly after the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission divided up responsibility for investigating antitrust complaints about the major tech firms. In addition to concerns about Google\u2019s control over the software that delivers online ads to consumers, the agency has been examining allegations that the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">abused its dominance</url> over search, several of the people close to the investigation said.</p><p>The department\u2019s investigators have fanned out over the media, tech and advertising industries, gathering evidence from companies that compete with Google. Antitrust inquiries often take years, but this one has moved unusually fast under Mr. Barr.</p><p>The agency recently hired 10 to 15 tech fellows to work on the investigation, one of the people close to the case said. The part of the antitrust office that is overseeing the inquiry, Technology and Financial Services, has been told that it will not be taking on any new matters, a sign that it has narrowed its focus to Google, one person said.</p><p>Officials have spent recent months trying to recruit a litigator from a law firm to join the team for the case, a practice that is not unusual for major antitrust cases. David Boies, for example, was the star of the government\u2019s 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft. The current search was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">reported earlier</url> by Bloomberg News.</p><p>The Justice Department has also hired an economic expert to work on the investigation, a standard but critical step, two people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Hired economists play a central role in the courtroom during an antitrust case, making sense of complicated data and economic principles for a judge or jury. It was not immediately clear which expert or experts had been hired.</p><p>A case against Google would almost certainly stretch on for years, and a trial is far from guaranteed: Companies frequently settle with federal prosecutors, and Justice Department staff could recommend against going to court. After the Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">began pursuing</url>Microsoft in the early 1990s, for example, a final settlement was reached years later, in 2002.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission closed its yearslong investigation into Google in 2012 without filing any charges despite hiring a prominent litigator to work on the case. But since then, European officials have brought several antitrust cases against the company, and aspects of its business have attracted the attention of other regulators around the world.</p><p>Mr. Barr signaled early on that he would be one of them. At his confirmation hearing last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">he said</url> that \u201ca lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.\u201d</p><p>Google is also under investigation by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, who could join a Justice Department lawsuit or file their own.</p><p>Few U.S. attorneys general have paid much attention to antitrust law, a division of the Justice Department that is rarely in the spotlight. But Mr. Barr, a former lawyer for Verizon and a former board member of Time Warner, two companies that regularly navigate antitrust law, is steeped in the subject.</p><p>In August, Mr. Barr pulled Lauren Willard, a lawyer from the antitrust division, to sit within his office to act as his liaison to the cases. In October, the department hired a veteran antitrust lawyer, Ryan Shores, to head technology antitrust cases including Google and to report to Mr. Rosen, Mr. Barr\u2019s deputy.</p><p>Mr. Shores is working closely with Ms. Willard, who is giving regular updates to Mr. Barr.</p><p>In a sign of how widely he interprets the agency\u2019s reach, Mr. Barr <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html\">said</url> last weekend that antitrust laws could be used against companies that allegedly restricted the spread of conservative views. Mr. Trump and conservatives have become increasingly critical of tech companies, including YouTube, which is owned by Google, arguing that the companies silence conservative voices.</p><p>\u201cOne way this can be addressed,\u201d Mr. Barr said in an interview with Fox News, \u201cis through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices.\u201d</p><p>Katie Benner contributed reporting.</p><p>PHOTOS: The Google campus, above, in Mountain View, Calif.

In a separate statement, she said the agency ''strongly disagrees'' with the claims of politicization made at Wednesday's hearing.</p><p>  Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman, said the company continued to cooperate with the Justice Department, ''and we don't have any updates or comments on speculation.''</p><p>  The Google investigation began last year, shortly after the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission divided up responsibility for investigating antitrust complaints about the major tech firms. In addition to concerns about Google's control over the software that delivers online ads to consumers, the agency has been examining allegations that the company abused its dominance over search, several of the people close to the investigation said.</p><p>  The department's investigators have fanned out over the media, tech and advertising industries, gathering evidence from companies that compete with Google. Antitrust inquiries often take years, but this one has moved unusually fast under Mr. Barr.</p><p>  The agency recently hired 10 to 15 tech fellows to work on the investigation, one of the people close to the case said. The part of the antitrust office that is overseeing the inquiry, Technology and Financial Services, has been told that it will not be taking on any new matters, a sign that it has narrowed its focus to Google, one person said.</p><p>  Officials have spent recent months trying to recruit a litigator from a law firm to join the team for the case, a practice that is not unusual for major antitrust cases. David Boies, for example, was the star of the government's 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft. The current search was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.</p><p>  The Justice Department has also hired an economic expert to work on the investigation, a standard but critical step, two people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>  Hired economists play a central role in the courtroom during an antitrust case, making sense of complicated data and economic principles for a judge or jury. It was not immediately clear which expert or experts had been hired.</p><p>  A case against Google would almost certainly stretch on for years, and a trial is far from guaranteed: Companies frequently settle with federal prosecutors, and Justice Department staff could recommend against going to court. After the Justice Department began pursuing Microsoft in the early 1990s, for example, a final settlement was reached years later, in 2002.</p><p>  The Federal Trade Commission closed its yearslong investigation into Google in 2012 without filing any charges despite hiring a prominent litigator to work on the case. But since then, European officials have brought several antitrust cases against the company, and aspects of its business have attracted the attention of other regulators around the world.</p><p>  Mr. Barr signaled early on that he would be one of them. At his confirmation hearing last year, he said that ''a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.''</p><p>Google is also under investigation by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, who could join a Justice Department lawsuit or file their own.</p><p>  Few U.S. attorneys general have paid much attention to antitrust law, a division of the Justice Department that is rarely in the spotlight. But Mr. Barr, a former lawyer for Verizon and a former board member of Time Warner, two companies that regularly navigate antitrust law, is steeped in the subject.</p><p>  In August, Mr. Barr pulled Lauren Willard, a lawyer from the antitrust division, to sit within his office to act as his liaison to the cases. In October, the department hired a veteran antitrust lawyer, Ryan Shores, to head technology antitrust cases including Google and to report to Mr. Rosen, Mr. Barr's deputy.</p><p>  Mr. Shores is working closely with Ms. Willard, who is giving regular updates to Mr. Barr.</p><p>  In a sign of how widely he interprets the agency's reach, Mr. Barr said last weekend that antitrust laws could be used against companies that allegedly restricted the spread of conservative views. Mr. Trump and conservatives have become increasingly critical of tech companies, including YouTube, which is owned by Google, arguing that the companies silence conservative voices.</p><p>  ''One way this can be addressed,'' Mr. Barr said in an interview with Fox News, ''is through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices.''</p><p>  Katie Benner contributed reporting.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: The Google campus, above, in Mountain View, Calif.

As chairman of IAC, a tech holding company that encompasses brands such as Angie's List, Vimeo and Care.com, Diller has become intimately familiar with Big Tech. The chairman of Expedia says his businesses rely on companies such as Google for distribution to the screens of consumers around the world, but at times they also compete with these same companies.    Diller says Washington hasn't yet stepped up to regulate the tech industry, but he's confident that's changing. The Justice Department is expected to bring a landmark antitrust suit against Google as early as next week, and just yesterday the White House held a gathering with state attorneys general to discuss allegations of anti-conservative bias in the industry (which the tech giants have denied).   My colleague Rachel Lerman and I spoke with Diller recently about his views on tech regulation, and he specifically raised concerns about the search giant's dominance. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.   What kind of regulation would you want to see the government impose [on the tech industry]?  Google is a monopoly, without question. It\u2019s the only absolute monopoly. What Google has invested every day, year to improve their product on behalf of consumers is absolutely fantastic, and they have vast profits from that. However, they have gone beyond the line in all respects doing what monopolies do. Regulation must set a relatively level playing field, which mean s that the monopolist cannot compete against its advertisers, primarily, which is what it has been doing without question for several years now.  Are there specific examples of times that Google has acted anti-competitively toward companies in your portfolio?   There\u2019s no question. Expedia is in the travel business. Expedia spends between $4 [billion] and $5 billion a year advertising its services on Google. Fine, happy to do so. However, when Google has begun to compete with our services, which they have done because they targeted the travel vertical to get closer and closer to the transaction itself.    Google is essentially competing with our services while taking our money.   It's not only that we have to advertise, which advertising for clicks is our world. That's an acceptable path, but when Google continues to restrict our advertising in replacement for ads that are more remunerative to Google, that's a problem.    I\u2019ll give you another example. We have a company called Home Advisor. Google decided it would open up the vertical of home services and asked us to be a founding member. However, all the data belongs to them and they would not let us literally advertise the name \u201cAngie Home Advisor\u201d inside that service because they did not want to allow another brand other than Google to have prominence.   What about this interesting relationship that companies like yours have with Google where they thrive on advertising on Google, but also sort of have this competition with Google. What would you like to see [Google] look like?  I don\u2019t want the person I\u2019m spending billions of dollars with to compete directly against me. I want them to take my advertising money and give me the best return for it.    As I\u2019ve said to most senior leaders at Google, \u201cWe all are serfs in your universe, in your land. We\u2019re serfs on your property. But it\u2019s wise to treat your serfs well, which i think you are increasingly not doing. Because if you let that go on for too long, the serfs tend to rise up and attack in hordes.\u201d  When you think about that relationship where you\u2019re relying on that platform and also competing with it, do you have that concern with Apple as well?   Yes. We have huge concerns with Apple and their App Store 30 percent hostage payment that they\u2019re demanding from anybody who accesses their service. They\u2019re a distribution platform where you access the App Store and download the app for which they provide some small services.    Take our Match dating services. I think we pay between $400 [million] and 500 million a year to download the app through the App Store. There's nobody who pays this 30 percent tribute that does not believe it's absolutely egregious.   [Apple did not comment on Diller's remarks, but the company has said the App Store required a \u201ctremendous investment over a decade\u201d to build and run.]  What would you like to see Apple do?   What Apple should do is stop their absolute policy of 30 percent, and they should reduce it to a reasonable distribution fee. Nobody in the world thinks paying 30 percent to simply be listed in an App Store is fair trade.   Apple is so misguided to me. Apple has a good relationship and imagery everywhere. I think they endanger it by this continued obstinance on this particular policy. It would be wise to reconsider.  Our top tabs TikTok is asking a federal court to halt Trump's ban of the app.   The move suggests TikTok and the Trump administration may not reach a deal this week, Rachel Lerman reports . TikTok is racing to finalize a deal by Sunday, the date that the ban is set to go into place. Trump has said he won't make a deal if TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance is still involved with the company, but it seems unlikely that Beijing would consent to a deal that cuts out the Chinese owner.   The Justice Department already countered that the emergency stay is unnecessary because only downloads of the app and updates will be banned at that time.     The White House has expressed concerns TikTok's Chinese ownership would allow the Chinese government to compel it to share U.S. user data. TikTok says it has never been asked by China for U.S. user data and would decline to provide it if asked. In the company's filing yesterday, its global chief security officer added it has safeguards in place against any large unauthorized downloads.   A coalition of WeChat users, another Chinese-owned app, recently won a court injunction on Trump's proposed ban.  The White House is looking at \u2018concrete legal steps\u2019 against social media companies allegedly silencing conservatives.   The threat ratchets up the president's ongoing attacks against platforms that have increasingly sought to limit his controversial and potentially violence-inciting posts, Tony Romm reports .    Trump called on nine Republican state attorneys general in attendance at his remarks yesterday to launch their own investigations into political bias against conservatives.    \u201cThe concern we have is the large amount of anecdotal evidence that supports the idea some of these private companies may be treating certain groups differently,\u201d Alan Wilson, the Republican attorney general of South Carolina, said after the gathering. He said the focus of the event, which was partially closed to the public, was on the state's roles  in combating alleged political bias.   The president has long accused Facebook, Twitter and Google of being biased against conservative content, though he's provided little evidence to support the claim. The companies have denied the allegations by Trump and other high-ranking Republicans.   Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was also in attendance:  Researchers say Facebook content inciting violence and praising the suspected shooter in Kenosha, Wis., is still getting millions of views.  Facebook committed to take steps to remove content explicitly linked to militia and extremist movements in recent months. But researchers at global nonprofit Avaaz found dozens of pages still sharing content inciting violence or glorifying Kyle Rittenhouse, a self-identified militia member suspected of killing two people at a protest in Kenosha, Wis.   The shooting came after Facebook failed earlier in the day to remove an event calling for armed people to \u201cprotect\u201d citizens during the protests.    As of yesterday, Facebook had removed four pages and two of the groups flagged by Avaaz. The remaining 71 groups and pages boast more than a combined 25 million interactions since the beginning of the month.    Facebook is still reviewing the content, spokesperson Sarah Pollack said.   But Facebook's reactive approach isn't getting to the heart of the problem and addressing what happens once users are radicalized by the content, Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran said. Instead, such activity just moves to new groups and pages. Just this week, Avaaz found a post featuring an image of Rittenhouse with a caption calling for a violent civil war over Trump's nomination for a new justice to the Supreme Court.    (Facebook confirmed the post was removed last night.)   It's an issue that's likely to be front and center as members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection meet today to discuss the effects of social media platforms on Americans.   Republicans are preparing to reignite accusations of anti-conservative bias at the event.    \u201cIs Twitter a fair and safe platform free speech and the battle of ideas \u2026 or a platform where content bias is acceptable as long as it influences the election in favor of the political whims of the woke mob?\u201d Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, will say in opening the hearing.    She will point to examples of Republicans being doxed and harassed on the platform.  Rant and rave  Twitter will begin testing voice DMs in Brazil, the Verge reports . \u201cDo they even care what users want anymore?\u201d the Internet wondered.   Tony Romm:   And then there's the whole harassment issue. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong:   Gen magazine's Andrea Gonz\u00e1lez-Ram\u00edrez found a silver lining.  The digital race to 2020 YouTube will add information panels to videos about voting by mail.  The company has used a similar strategy to provide context for subjects ripe for misinformation, such the moon landing and the novel coronavirus, according to a blog post from YouTube's parent company Google . Any videos that discuss mail voting will have an information panel underneath directing viewers to information from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.   Information panels will also show up for queries on how to vote and about specific candidates.   YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, will also start pushing reminders about how to register to vote and how to volunteer at the polls   More digital campaign news:  Inside the industry Tesla is suing the U.S. government over a Trump tariff on parts from China.   The electric-car maker is seeking a refund with interest on the parts subjected to additional tariffs by Trump in 2018 and 2019, CNBC reports . Tesla's lawyers are arguing the U.S. Trade Representative did not provide a meaningful opportunity for outside comment before the decision was made and failed to consider relevant factors when making its decision.\u201d   Tesla was granted several waivers to the tariffs on some parts, but not the car's computer and screen. The lawsuit doesn't say how much in tariffs Tesla ultimately paid.
