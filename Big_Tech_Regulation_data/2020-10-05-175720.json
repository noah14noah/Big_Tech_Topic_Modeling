Online, what is good for business is not necessarily good for individuals or societies. Big Tech platforms make it easy to manipulate opinion, spew hate, and incite violence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We once naively believed that mass access to the World Wide Web would inevitably democratize information; today, we worry about the emergence of an \"addiction economy\" that is bad for everyone. What can be done to support more humane, ethical, and effective technology?</p><p>One important way to address this problem in a systemic way is by reforming education in the so-called STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering, and math. Policymakers worldwide are already focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates and the diversity of STEM students. But we should also expand the scope of STEM education, to ensure that students learn to evaluate and respond to the social, economic, and political consequences of their work.</p><p>This does not mean adding existing humanities or social sciences courses to a STEM curriculum. Rather, it will require the development of an entirely new curriculum that gives the next generation of technologists, engineers, scientists, and mathematicians the formal foundations - including shared vocabulary and intellectual frameworks - for considering the macro effects of their actions on society. Without such a framework, the gap between the promise of innovation and the reality of human experience will only grow.</p><p>Fortunately, the seeds of this educational revolution are already sprouting. Some universities are adding ethics classes to the STEM curriculum. Stanford University, with its deep links to the tech industry, has recently added courses with topics like \"Ethics, Public Policy, and Technological Change\" and \"Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy.\"</p><p>Stanford has also recently launched a new Human-Centered AI Initiative, which recognises that \"the development of AI should be paired with an ongoing study of its impact on human society, and guided accordingly.\" Last year, Cornell launched the Milstein Program in Technology and Humanity.</p><p>These early initiatives can serve as important testing grounds for new curricula and methods. But the real change will come only when all STEM programs provide students with the tools they need to carry out a credible assessment of their work's effects on humanity.</p><p>Of course, such changes will mean little if we do not know what the most effective tools actually are. That is why continued experimentation is also essential.</p><p>Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowd-sourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics. The growing online database already contains more than 200 different syllabi from universities around the world. Yet only one-quarter of these courses are taught by computer science faculty. The rest are taught in departments such as law, philosophy, and communications, which means that they are not being tailored to STEM-related challenges. More fundamentally, such standalone courses are not ideal. A better approach, as Fiesler herself agrees, would focus on integrating ethics into \"everyday practice\" in the STEM fields. (Fiesler hopes that her database will help faculty make this case to their universities.)</p><p>This is the goal of the Responsible CS Challenge, launched last month by Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, and Mozilla. The two-year challenge should encourage computer science professors in the United States to integrate ethics into their undergraduate curriculum, so that STEM students can gain a deeper understanding of how technology affects humanity.</p><p>This is a good first step, but much more must be done. For one thing, while the initial focus on ethics makes sense, similar explorations will be needed in a wide variety of disciplines such as economics, psychology, and many more of the so-called humanities.</p><p>Expanding STEM education to include such broader considerations would serve as a cornerstone of a more comprehensive long-term strategy to ensure that technology serves society in overwhelmingly positive ways. That strategy must also include changes, say, to business models, incentives, innovation strategies, and regulatory regimes - changes that should be pursued by people whose education has prepared them to address the effects of their work on the rest of us.</p><p>Mitchell Baker is Co-Founder and Chair of the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation.</p><p>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</url></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:distribution@project-syndicate.org\">distribution@project-syndicate.org</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Online, what is good for business is not necessarily good for individuals or societies. Big Tech platforms make it easy to manipulate opinion, spew hate and incite violence. We once naively believed that mass access to the World Wide Web would inevitably democratise information; today, we worry about the emergence of an 'addiction economy' that is bad for everyone. </p><p>What can be done to support more humane, ethical and effective technology? One important way to address this problem in a systemic way is by reforming education in the so-called STEM disciplines: science, technology, engineering and math. Policymakers, worldwide, are already focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates and the diversity of STEM students. But we should also expand the scope of STEM education, to ensure that students learn to evaluate and respond to the social, economic and political consequences of their work. This does not mean adding existing humanities or social sciences courses to a STEM curriculum. Rather, it will require the development of an entirely new curriculum that gives the next generation of technologists, engineers, scientists and mathematicians the formal foundations \u2014 including shared vocabulary and intellectual frameworks, for considering the macro effects of their actions on society. Without such a framework, the gap between the promise of innovation and the reality of human experience will only grow. Fortunately, the seeds of this educational revolution are already sprouting. Some universities are adding ethics classes to the STEM curriculum. Stanford University, with its deep links to the tech industry, has recently added courses with topics like 'Ethics, Public Policy and Technological Change' and 'Computers, Ethics and Public Policy'. Stanford has also recently launched a new Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (AI) Initiative, which recognises that 'the development of AI should be paired with an ongoing study of its impact on human society, and guided accordingly.' Last year, Cornell launched the Milstein Programme in Technology and Humanity. These early initiatives can serve as important testing grounds for new curricula and methods. But the real change will come only when all STEM programmes provide students with the tools they need to carry out a credible assessment of their work's effects on humanity. Of course, such changes will mean little if we do not know what the most effective tools actually are. That is why continued experimentation is also essential. Casey Fiesler of the University of Colorado, Boulder, is pursuing just such experimentation by crowd-sourcing syllabi focused on tech ethics. The growing online database already contains more than 200 different syllabi from universities around the world. Yet only one-quarter of these courses are taught by computer science faculty. The rest are taught in departments such as law, philosophy and communications, which means that they are not being tailored to STEM-related challenges. More fundamentally, such standalone courses are not ideal. A better approach, as Fiesler herself agrees, would focus on integrating ethics into 'everyday practice' in the STEM fields. Fiesler hopes that her database will help faculty make this case to their universities. This is the goal of the Responsible CS Challenge, launched last month by Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, Craig Newmark Philanthropies and Mozilla. The two-year challenge should encourage computer science professors in the United States to integrate ethics into their undergraduate curriculum, so that STEM students can gain a deeper understanding of how technology affects humanity. This is a good first step, but much more must be done. For one thing, while the initial focus on ethics makes sense, similar explorations will be needed in a wide variety of disciplines such as economics, psychology and many more of the so-called humanities. Expanding STEM education to include such broader considerations would serve as a cornerstone of a more comprehensive long-term strategy to ensure that technology serves society in overwhelmingly positive ways. That strategy must also include changes, say, to business models, incentives, innovation strategies and regulatory regimes, changes that should be pursued by people whose education has prepared them to address the effects of their work on the rest of us.

In a letter co-signed by more than 40 former Google researchers, professors and tech activists, Poulson accused Schmidt of ethical misconduct during his time as CEO of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HAI defended its decision to invite Schmidt, citing the conference's commitment to promoting diverse perspectives on the role of AI society. At the conference, Schmidt spoke alongside former European Parliament member Marietje Schaake, who has pushed for greater regulation of big data and stronger privacy protections.</p><p>Schmidt opened the session by describing how AI has enabled important breakthroughs in science research. As scientific disciplines become increasingly data-dependent, Schmidt said, powerful algorithms can accelerate computation and analysis process of the data and also lead to unexpected discoveries.</p><p>He added that current developments in health research facilitated by AI have made earlier diagnosis of serious diseases possible and \"will save millions of people over the next five or ten years.\"</p><p>The achievement of powerful algorithms goes beyond medical lab or hospital, he said.</p><p>\"Google, for example, automatically captions 1 billion YouTube videos in 10 different languages,\" Schmidt said. \"You can imagine the impact of that to global diffusion of information.\"</p><p>Schmidt said that both the private and public sector must make sure these AI innovations are under ethical and legal control.</p><p>\"We know that data has bias,\" Schmidt said. \"That is not shocking.\"</p><p>He said that both the government and corporations should \"understand the bias and identify\" it to mitigate side effects.</p><p>Schmidt argued international collaboration between scientists and researchers was crucial.</p><p>\"Even in a situation where everyone hates each other, there are still areas of common agreement,\" Schmidt continued, calling for cooperation with the talent pool of researchers in China. He added that the world could benefit from having a \"common framework,\" through which governments and companies can establish norms in the discussion of regulatory structure and policies.</p><p>\"I think it is also important that we establish right here right now, that the liberal values of Stanford University and Western values are the ones that should win,\" Schmidt said. \"We shouldn't allow other values ... we need to be unified and clear on that.\"</p><p>Schaake spoke after Schmidt and focused her talk on the regulation of big tech.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Adam Taggart via PeakProsperity.com,[3] Bull market liftoff? Or bear rally rollover?  Stocks are at an inflection point. After a bruising end to 2018, the major indices caught fire at the turn of the New Year as the world's central banking cartel leapt into action. </p><p>Here's how the US Federal Reserve reacted:  The central banks have more than demonstrated that they are now subservient to the markets. Losses will not be tolerated Which is why the chart below by Sven Henrich goes far in explaining why they've been in full panic mode this year: a major long-term technical breakdown threatened. As prices fell in later 2018, the S...00 broke through a trendline that had remained unviolated since the markets began recovering from the Great Financial Crisis in 2009:  As Sven has been doing an excellent job of monitoring, this violated trendline may now have flipped from \"support\" to \"ceiling\" for the S... Which may be why we were treated to not just one, but three Federal Reserve chairs during last weekend's episode of60 Minutes. Their triple-strength \"all is well\" show of force was good enough to juice the S...ack up to the long-term trendline this week \u2014 but not convincingly through it. The market looks very much paused at the brink of a breakout here. The bulls are expecting a sharp rebound in GDP from Q1, which they claim was artificially low due the government shutdown. They point to 2018's solid 3% economic growth, claiming the US is humming along fine and about to get a shot of adrenaline once America and China announce an end to their trade war. In their eyes, the S...s poised to rocket higher once it punches vigorously above 2820. The bears see a topping out of a classic bear market rally, one that has been propelled by no convincing fundamentals \u2014 only central bank jawboning/easing and continued massive buyback programs (plus this week's rareQuad Witching[4]options expiration). They see an extremely overbought market, with stocks ready to break down to new lows for the year. Which Way From Here? If we look over at the bond markets, we see no confirmation at all of the recent exuberance in equities, especially the melt-up seen this week:  When the bond and stock markets disagree, it's usually the (much larger) bond market that has it right. Moreover, many analysts, includingGoldman Sachs' volatility trader Moran Freeman[5], are predicting a near-term resurgence in the VIX, which would correlate with lower stock prices. Returning to Sven Henrich's charts, here he shows how we've been seeing a successive pairing of descending wedges for volatility (predictive of upside breakouts) and ascending wedges for the S...predictive of downward breakdowns). The tighter the wedges, the more compression they have to force prices to move quickly when they break:  (Source[6]) This week, the VIX hit its lowest level ($12.50) of 2019. This suggests a reversal is much more likely going forward --possibly as high as $50[7]-- than continued suppression. And beyond the technical arguments, the fundamental underlying the markets are on their way from bad to worse. DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach basically vomited on the bull case in his latest macro market outlook, optimistically-titledHighway To Hell[8](well worth the viewing). In it, he noted how global economic indicators are falling off a cliff at this point:  And in terms of stocks specifically, he emphasizes that despite the early ramp-up this year, the S...was and is in a bear market\", and that he predictsstocks will take out the December low during the course of 2019 and markets will roll over earlier than they did last year[9]. GMO's Jeremy Grantham sounds a similar warning, albeit a longer-looking one. Grantham, who has been expecting a meltdown in stocks since last year, not only sees the US stocks as overpriced \u2014 he predicts they will deliversub-par returns for the next two decades that will \"break of lot of hearts\"[10]among today's investors. Tech Looking Especially Vulnerable I wroteseveral reports last year[11]warning of dangerous overvaluation of the FAANG stocks, which had yet to show any weakness at that time. I went as far as to issue a rare notice that I was building a short position against these stocks, one rewarded with a 50% return when successfully exited three months later. If anything, the big Tech stocks look even more vulnerable now than they did back then. The NASDAQ (of which the FAANG stocks comprise the majority of the index's market cap) has rocketed up over 20% since its December lows, sitting now just 5% below it's all-time high. This surge in value is starkly contradicted by the negative developments arising for these companies in 2019. Here are just a few recent ones: Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is proposing much tougher regulation, specificallycalling for the breakup[12]ofAmazon,GoogleandFacebook.She's also making the case thatAppleshould beprevented from selling apps[13]on the App Store it operates.Politicians and regulators in the EU[14]are making similar arguments.  Two ofFacebook's key executives (it's Chief Product Officer and the head of WhatsApp)just resigned,[15]right as the companyfaces a criminal probe[16]into past security and privacy scandals.  Apple'siPhone sales dropped worldwide[17]last year, falling 12% in the critical holiday FYQ4 quarter. Since then, smartphone demand in China has beenfalling off a cliff[18]-- at its lowest in years.  Netflixis still burning cash at a horrifying pace while large competitors are readying to provide consumers with compelling alternatives. Disney recently announced its streaming service will include itsentire movie catalog[19](soon to include Fox's, as well), for a cheaper price than Netflix. Apple is expected to launch its service in May, and be free.  GoogleandFacebookare under threat ofmulti-billion dollar fines in the UK[20]if they fail to rid their platforms of \"toxic content\". Google is also fending off similar fines inChina[21],India[22]andFrance[23].  I could easily go on. But do the above headwinds (along with a Q1 2019 US economy growing ata pitiful 0.4%[24]) justify Tech stock prices kissing their all-time highs? No. Not even close. Which is why I'm moving a percentage of my \"dry powder\" cash savings into a new short position at this time, one larger than I placed last year. It's not a move I take lightly (and as usual, this is NOT personal financial advice). I'm only doing it because, in my estimation, the preponderance of evidence for a near-term reversal is overwhelming my strong default risk-averse preference to sit on the sidelines. InPart 2: Assume The Crash Position[25]we detail out the wide range of options that investors skeptical of current market valuations can consider \u2014 for both protecting against a downturn and, for the more courageous, profiting from one. We also reveal the latest outlook from our endorsed financial advisor as well as the latest trades I'm making in my own portfolio. We should know soon which way this market breaks. If it indeed breaks downward, make sure you've prepared in advance for it. Click here to read Part 2[26]of this report(free executive summary,enrollment[27]required for full access).

Continue reading Half of all Facebook moderators may develop mental health issues</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In November 2018 I received a message that changed my life. A person working as a moderator for Facebook in Phoenix through a company called Cognizant asked to get on the phone and talk about some of what he was seeing there. His experiences shocked me, and after I wrote about what he and his colleagues were going through in The Verge, they would go on to shock a lot more people.</p><p>It was an office where moderators would have panic attacks while still in training, traumatized by daily exposure to gore and other disturbing posts. Where ever-shifting content policies, and demands for near-perfect accuracy, could make the job itself impossible. And where months of sifting through conspiracy theories led some moderators to embrace fringe viewpoints, walking through the building insisting that the earth is flat.</p><p>I wrote about the experiences of a dozen current and former moderators at the Phoenix site last February. A few months later, after hearing from employees that conditions at Cognizant s Tampa site were even more grim, I traveled there and talked to a dozen more workers. There I learned of a stressed-out moderator who died of a heart attack at his desk at the age of 42. I learned of multiple sexual harassment suits that had been filed against various workers at the site. And I met three brave former moderators who violated their non-disclosure agreements to describe their working conditions on camera.</p><p>By then a lawsuit by a former moderator named Selena Scola, which accused Facebook of creating an unsafe workplace that had caused her mental health problems, was working its way through the courts. And on Friday, lawyers filed a preliminary settlement in the case. I wrote about it today at The Verge:</p><p>In a landmark acknowledgment of the toll that content moderation takes on its workforce, Facebook has agreed to pay $52 million to current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues developed on the job. In a preliminary settlement filed on Friday in San Mateo Superior Court, the social network agreed to pay damages to American moderators and provide more counseling to them while they work.</p><p>Each moderator will receive a minimum of $1,000 and will be eligible for additional compensation if they are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder or related conditions. The settlement covers 11,250 moderators, and lawyers in the case believe that as many as half of them may be eligible for extra pay related to mental health issues associated with their time working for Facebook, including depression and addiction.</p><p> We are so pleased that Facebook worked with us to create an unprecedented program to help people performing work that was unimaginable even a few years ago,  said Steve Williams, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement.  The harm that can be suffered from this work is real and severe. </p><p>After a year of reporting on the lives of these moderators   I also profiled people who do the work for Google and YouTube   it seemed clear to me that some percentage of people who work as moderators will suffer long-term mental health consequences. But what is that percentage?</p><p>Last year I published some leaked audio from a Facebook all-hands meeting in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged this range of experiences.  Within a population of 30,000 people, there s going to be a distribution of experiences that people have,  Zuckerberg said, referring to the number of people Facebook has working on trust and safety issues around the world.  We want to do everything we can to make sure that even the people who are having the worst experiences, that we re making sure that we support them as well as possible. </p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of today s news is that it begins to answer the question of how many moderators are affected. Designing a settlement required that lawyers for Facebook and the plaintiffs estimate how many people would make claims. And the number is much higher than I had imagined.</p><p>This lawsuit covers only people who have worked for Facebook through third-party vendors in the United States from 2015 until today, a group whose size is estimated to be 11,250 people. (A similar lawsuit is still pending in Irelandcovering European workers.) Both Facebook and plaintiffs  lawyers consulted with experts in post-traumatic stress and vicarious trauma. Based on those discussions, a lawyer for the plaintiffs told me, as many as half of the members of the class are expected to qualify for additional payments.</p><p>In other words, if you become a moderator for Facebook, a legal precedent suggests you have a one in two chance of suffering negative mental health consequences for doing the work.</p><p>Perhaps those odds will come down as Facebook implements some of the other changes they agreed to in the settlement, such as providing more counseling and offering workers tools to adjust the content that they re viewing   turning it black and white, turning off audio by default, and so on. But the risk to human lives is real, and it s not going away.</p><p>Another aspect to consider: how much will the average moderator get paid as a result of the settlement? The $52 million figure is less impressive when you consider that fully 32.7 percent of it has been earmarked for the lawyers in the case, leaving $35 million left over for everyone else.</p><p>The settlement was designed to compensate moderators in tiers. The first tier grants $1,000 to everyone, in the hopes that moderators use the money to get a mental health checkup from a doctor. For those who are either newly diagnosed or already have diagnoses, the settlement provides an additional $1,500 to $6,000 based on the severity of their cases. And then moderators can also submit evidence of distress suffered as a result of their work to win up to $50,000 per person in damages.</p><p>The sums could all be much smaller depending on how many members of the class apply and are found eligible for benefits beyond the first $1,000. If half the class were found eligible for additional mental health benefits and received equal compensation   which will not be the case but may be useful for ballpark-estimation purposes   there would be $4,222.22 available per moderator.</p><p>In my Twitter replies, lots of folks objected to the size of the payment, arguing it should have been much higher. Here, for example, is person who called the settlement  a day s worth of random market fluctuation in profits for Facebook.  I won t argue here   many of these content moderation roles are essentially first responder jobs, not nearly as different as you might think from police officers and paramedics, and they deserve compensation and benefits more closely in line with the service they provide and the risks that they take.</p><p>I called up Shawn Speagle, a former Facebook moderator who worked at the Tampa site, to tell me what he thought. Speagle, who was not involved in the lawsuit, worked for Cognizant from March to October 2018. During that time, he was exposed to videos of extreme violence and animal abuse on a near-daily basis, and he began to overeat and experience night terrors. After being fired, he was diagnosed with PTSD.</p><p>He said that a year of psychiatric care had helped him significantly with his symptoms, but also that the things he had seen continue to haunt him.  It s been a very long ride,  Speagle told me Tuesday.  It s been very difficult to forget about a lot of that stuff. You never do   it just sticks with you forever. Even though it was just seen over a screen, those lives are never coming back. I just wish that Facebook would recognize that. </p><p>Speagle said that he sometimes felt embarrassed describing his PTSD to others, worrying they wouldn t quite believe a person could develop the condition by reviewing Facebook posts.  There were a lot of times when it was humiliating,  he said. But psychiatrists helped him to understand that the phenomenon known as vicarious trauma   watching others experience pain   is real, and can be dangerous. He has since become a public school teacher.</p><p>I asked him what he thought of the payout he might now be eligible for.</p><p> I would be fine getting no money,  Speagle told me.  I just wanted to bring this forward. When I did the job at Facebook, I was told I was making the world a better place for animals and young people. The reason I came forward was to stick to true to that. Money and a lawsuit have nothing to do with what I did. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram</emphasis>is launching new features aimed at making the platform a more positive space.

The move escalates Silicon Valley s battle with Washington at time when government officials are still threatening to break up large companies. Tony Romm at The Washington Post has the story:</p><p>The organization is called American Edge, and it aims through a barrage of advertising and other political spending to convince policymakers that Silicon Valley is essential to the U.S. economy and the future of free speech, according to three people familiar with the matter as well as documents reviewed by The Washington Post. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the group because it hasn t officially been announced.</p><p>In December, American Edge formed as a nonprofit organization, and last month, it registered an accompanying foundation, according to incorporation documents filed in Virginia. The setup essentially allows it to navigate a thicket of tax laws in such a way that it can raise money, and blitz the airwaves with ads, without the obligation of disclosing all of its donors. Many powerful political actors   including the National Rifle Association   similarly operate with the aid of  social welfare  groups.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>released a new report detailing how it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human fact-checkers to enforce its community standards.

As this is our first financial presentation as Reach plc, I thought I'd start by playing a short video to put some context behind the reason for our new name.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: There we go. So as usual, I'll take you through a few highlights before handing over to Vijay for a more detailed financial update on our first half performance. I will then return with a strategic and operational update.</p><p>So the biggest highlight of the half year was completing the acquisition of the Express &amp; Star at the end of February and then receiving CMA and Ofcom clearance for the transaction on the 20th of June.</p><p>During the 4-month period of hold separate, the business was run by a highly competent interim management team that we were able to appoint post-acquisition.</p><p>Since receiving clearance, we've been working hard on our integration plans and remain confident in our ability to deliver GBP 20 million of annualized synergies by 2020. This deal transforms the scale of the group, both in print and in digital, and I'll talk about it in more detail later in the presentation.</p><p>Turning to the core business. It was a half year of contrasting fortunes. Nationally sold print advertising had a strong 6 months, with low single-figure percentage declines. However, regional advertising was disappointing and below our expectations. This slower performance in local advertising is reflected in the significant noncash impairment charge.</p><p>Growth in digital audience and revenue remains vital to our strategy. And although we saw audience growth, we, like most other news brands, were adversely affected by algorithm changes from Facebook and to a lesser extent, Google. And I'll come back to both of these points later. Despite this, we grew digital yields, with digital revenue growing faster than audience. The board has declared an interim dividend of 2.37p, representing an increase of 5.3% from the 2017 interim dividend. We remain confident in our clear strategy and anticipate trading for the year to be in line with expectations.</p><p>So let me now hand over to Vijay to cover the first half financial performance.</p><p>VIJAY LAKHMAN VAGHELA, GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR, GROUP COMPANY SECRETARY &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, REACH PLC: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the results of the acquired U.K. Publishing assets of Northern &amp; Shell referred to as Express &amp; Star in the presentation.</p><p>As you know, we completed the acquisition on 28th of February 2018, and the results are consolidated from the 1st of March. The results since completing the acquisition are shown on this slide. The business has had a strong performance since acquisition, with revenue of GBP 64.8 million and adjusted operating profit of GBP 10.8 million.</p><p>Publishing print revenue includes all circulation, advertising and other related revenue from our 4 newspapers and 3 magazines. Publishing digital includes all revenue from the 5 digital sites. Printing includes all third-party revenue generated by the Luton print plant acquired with the business. Key print contracts include a number of Metros outside London and CTAM.</p><p>Throughout the presentation, I will focus on adjusted results. Whilst there is no difference between statutory and adjusted revenue, I will refer to like-for-like revenue trends, as set out in this slide. I will start with our performance before moving on to the acquisition of Express &amp; Star, adjusted items, cash flow, pensions, financing, and then conclude with an outlook.</p><p>Revenue increased by 10.6% to GBP 353.8 million, including revenue from Express &amp; Star. On a like-for-like basis, revenue fell by 7.2%. Operating profit was up 6.2% to GBP 66.5 million, with EBITDA up 6.4% to GBP 77.6 million. Earnings per share increased by 1.7% to 18.2p per share. The increase reflects the benefit of the profits from Express &amp; Star and is after the impact of issuing equity and raising debt to fund the acquisition. The business delivered a positive performance in the print market that has remained challenging, particularly in our regionals business.</p><p>You will have seen from our announcement this morning, we have had a statutory loss of GBP 107.3 million for the period due to a noncash impairment charge of GBP 150 million against the carrying value of the publishing rights and titles of our regionals business. I'll provide more detail on this in a moment.</p><p>I will now go through the performance by segment, starting with Publishing. Revenue increased by 11.5% to GBP 330.5 million. Excluding Express &amp; Star, revenue fell by GBP 29.6 million, which includes the impact of handing back 2 Metros to DMGT and other portfolio changes. On a like-for-like basis, revenue fell by 7.4%. Operating profit increased by 5.5% to GBP 70.5 million, with operating margin falling by 1.2 percentage points to 21.3%, reflecting the lower margin from Express &amp; Star and weaker performance from our regionals business due to a more challenging local print advertising market and slower-than-anticipated digital growth.</p><p>I will now talk you through the print and digital revenue trends, starting with print. Publishing print revenue increased by 10.6% on a like-for-like basis. This was a decline of 9.3%. Circulation revenue, which now represents 62% of print revenue, an increase of almost 5 percentage points from 2017, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Express &amp; Star, which has a higher percentage of the more resilient circulation revenue and lower levels of the more challenged print advertising. On a like-for-like basis, circulation revenue fell by 5.6%, with the benefit of cover price increases, which are helping to partially mitigate the impact of falling volumes. Circulation revenue trends have also been impacted by a change in sales in Spain, which are through a royalty agreement from July 2017. Excluding foreign copy sales, circulation revenue would have fallen by circa 5%.</p><p>Print advertising now represents 31% of print revenue, a fall of almost 5 percentage points from 2017, fell by 16.6% on a like-for-like basis. This is an improved performance from the 19.3% decline in 2017. The trends reflect continued high double-digit declines for locally sold advertising in the regional newspapers and advertising revenue in the paid-for magazines acquired with Express &amp; Star. This has been partially mitigated by improved trends for national advertising across the entire portfolio of newspapers. On a like-for-like basis, display and other advertising revenue fell by 15.5%, and classified fell by 18.3%. Like-for-like Other print revenue fell by 5.4%, driven by declines in business enterprise and leaflets.</p><p>Publishing digital revenue grew by 16.9% to GBP 48.4 million. On a like-for-like basis, the growth was 6%, which is only marginally down on the 7% growth achieved in 2017. Display and transactional revenue grew by 11.5%, with classified revenue falling by 19.8%. The growth in digital and transactional revenue, which is predominantly linked to audience, now accounts for 86% of digital revenue, an increase of 4 percentage points from 2017. This reflects growth in page views on a like-for-like basis of 9.3%.</p><p>The growth in digital audience has been impacted by algorithm changes by Facebook and Google, and Simon will provide more insight into the steps we are taking to accelerate growth. We've also had strong growth in digital marketing services revenue in the period.</p><p>The decline in digital classified revenue, which is largely upsold from print, reflects the impact of falling print volumes. In particular, recruitment advertising, which represents 41% of classified revenue, was down 36.7%. The significant decline in recruitment has been partially mitigated by better performance from public notices and BMDs. Whilst we stride to maximize classified revenue, they now only represent 14% of total digital revenues.</p><p>I will now briefly cover our other businesses, starting with printing. Printing revenue increased by 3.6% to GBP 17.5 million. Printing now includes revenue of GBP 1.2 million from the Luton plant acquired with Express &amp; Star. On a like-for-like basis, revenue fell by 0.6%, with falling volumes and newsprint supply for our customers, mostly offset by new contracts including the new Guardian print contract. Costs increased by GBP 9.2 million, and charges to the Publishing division increased by GBP 8.6 million, reflecting the costs associated with the Express &amp; Star titles. Underlying costs continued to be tightly managed.</p><p>Our Specialist Digital businesses, comprising recruitment and email marketing services, experienced a marginal fall in revenue and increasing cost, resulting in operating profit falling by GBP 0.3 million. Net central loss improved by GBP 0.5 million to GBP 5 million. A revenue decline of GBP 0.7 million was driven by reduced rental income, as leases were terminated due to office closures and contraction of space, and we will see an increased level of decline in the second half.</p><p>Central costs fell by GBP 0.9 million to GBP 7 million, reflecting ongoing tight management of the cost base. Our share of income from associates increased by GBP 0.3 million, with our share of profits from the PA improving GBP 0.2 million, and we've also achieved GBP 0.1 million share of profits from Brand Events, which we invested in during 2016.</p><p>I will now go through group costs.</p><p>Group costs increased by GBP 30.2 million to GBP 288.1 million. Excluding Express &amp; Star, costs fell by GBP 23.8 million, with GBP 9 million of structural cost savings. We are now targeting structural cost savings for the full year of GBP 18 million, GBP 3 million ahead of our original target. Cost savings have been delivered across all cost categories. In addition to structural cost savings, we have commenced the integration of Express &amp; Star, and at this stage, we anticipate synergy savings of GBP 2 million in the second half of the year. We will also continue to tightly manage the portfolio of newspaper titles and close titles which move into loss and where there are no initiatives that would move these titles into profitability.</p><p>The continued drive for efficiencies will help offset the impact of a further increase in newsprint prices in the second half. During the period, we incurred GBP 7.9 million of restructuring costs in the delivery of the cost-reduction measures, and we expect cost of circa GBP 20 million in delivery of GBP 18 million of structural cost savings and GBP 2 million of synergy savings in 2018. The restructuring costs for the year include an element of cost associated with the delivery of synergy savings in 2019.</p><p>I will now talk you through the consideration paid in payable for the acquisition of Express &amp; Star. Total equity value for the acquisition is GBP 121.7 million, with cash consideration of GBP 101.7 million and GBP 20 million settled through the issue of new shares in Reach plc. The total cash consideration of GBP 101.7 million will be paid in 5 tranches: initial cash consideration of GBP 42.7 million paid on completion; 4 tranches of GBP 11.9 million, GBP 16 million, GBP 17.1 million and GBP 7 million to be paid on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of completion respectively. These total GBP 59 million. This total cash consideration of GBP 101.7 million excludes a net working capital adjustment of GBP 0.1 million.</p><p>In addition to equity consideration, the group has made an initial payment to the Express &amp; Star pension scheme of GBP 41.2 million and entered into a new recovery plan with payments of GBP 29.2 million over the next 10 years. The cash consideration, initial payments of the pension schemes and transaction costs have been funded by drawing GBP 70 million on a new GBP 75 million, 4-year acquisition term loan with the balance drawn on our existing GBP 91.7 million RCF and cash balances. A further GBP 5 million will be payable on completion of the acquisition of the assets in Republic of Ireland, which is conditional upon obtaining regulatory clearance. The remaining GBP 5 million undrawn on the acquisition facility will be drawn for this purpose.</p><p>We incurred transaction costs of GBP 8.5 million on the acquisition, with GBP 6.3 million in the period and GBP 2.2 million during 2017.</p><p>The reconciling items between statutory and adjusted operating profit totaled GBP 173.8 million. The most significant item in the period is the GBP 150 million impairment of the carrying value of publishing rights and titles for the regionals business. The trading environment for local advertising in our regionals business has been more challenging in the first half than expected, with high double-digit declines in print advertising and reduced levels of growth in digital display and transactional revenue. This has contributed to a reduction in future projections for revenue and cash flows in the model used for assessing the value of the regionals' publishing rights and titles. Whilst this noncash charge reflects the impact of the more challenging local advertising environment, it does not fully account for, as required by accounting standards, the benefit of the scale of our digital audiences and opportunities to drive revenue and profit in the longer term. The charge relates to the former Trinity Mirror and Local World regional businesses and is not specific to any acquisition. Other than the impairment charge, the most significant items are restructuring, transaction costs for the acquisition of Express &amp; Star and an increase in the provision for historical legal issues of GBP 7.5 million. I have already covered the first 2 of these.</p><p>We increased the provision for historical legal issues as the costs of settling claims, in particular the claimants' legal costs, are higher than expected. The remaining provision at the period-end is GBP 11.6 million. This process is taking longer than previously anticipated due to the complex and lengthy legal process with increased legal costs, and creates ongoing uncertainty. Whilst the level of uncertainty prevails, the board remains confident that this is manageable and does not undermine the delivery of our strategy.</p><p>In addition to the acquisition transaction cost to date, we expect some cost in the second half as we move to obtain regulatory clearance on the GBP 5 million acquisition of the assets in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>We continue to generate strong cash flows during the year, with net cash inflow of GBP 28.6 million before distribution to shareholders. Key items of note in the period are: increasing capital expenditure of GBP 2.6 million to GBP 7 million as we migrated part of our IT infrastructure to the cloud, continued the integration of our former Local World businesses on the Reach Publishing platform and the rollout of new finance systems. We anticipate capital expenditure of GBP 15 million for the full year, including capital expenditure relating to Express &amp; Star. We made contributions to defined benefit pension schemes of GBP 24.4 million excluding the GBP 41.2 million initial payment -- an increase of GBP 6.3 million, reflecting the new recovery plans and contributions to the Express &amp; Star pension schemes. And there was GBP 90.1 million of cash outflows for the acquisition of Express &amp; Star, which includes the cash payments for equity, working capital, initial pension payment and transaction costs.</p><p>Before going through financing, I will provide some further detail on pensions. The IAS 19 pension deficit fell by GBP 80.6 million to GBP 297 million. On a post-tax basis, the deficit fell by GBP 69.1 million to GBP 242.3 million. The GBP 297 million deficit is net of an accounting surplus of GBP 5.9 million on the Express &amp; Star pension schemes. Excluding Express &amp; Star, the pension schemes deficit fell by GBP 74.7 million. The fall in the deficit reflects strong asset returns, company contributions and a favorable movement in the discount rate and inflation assumptions, which resulted in the real discount rate improving by 0.2 percentage points from a negative 6 -- 0.65% to a negative 0.45%. Included in the Express &amp; Star schemes, approximately 13% of scheme liabilities are hedged through insurance contracts, which provide protection against volatility in the financial markets. The liabilities are very sensitive to movements in the discount rate. A 50 basis points increase in the discount rate with all assumptions remaining -- all other assumptions remaining the same would result in liabilities falling by GBP 202 million and the deficit falling by GBP 183 million.</p><p>Although there are deficits in our schemes, there are no liquidity issues, and the schemes continue to meet the majority of the benefit payments through investment income and company contributions.</p><p>Contributions for the second half will be GBP 24.5 million, with contributions for the next 2 years of GBP 48.9 million per annum. The next actuarial valuations for all 6 schemes will be December 2019, and we anticipate these to be completed by the end of 2020, ahead of the March 2021 statutory deadline.</p><p>The continued robust cash flows of the business ensured net debt only increased by GBP 72 million to GBP 81 million, after expending GBP 90.1 million in relation to the acquisition of Express &amp; Star. The group has 2 financing facilities: the GBP 91.7 million amortizing revolving credit facility and that GBP 75 million acquisition term loan, both of which are committed until December 2021. On 27th of July 2018, the group prepaid the GBP 10 million repayment due in December '18 under the acquisition term loan. The amortization of the RCF and term loan is shown in this slide, reflecting the early repayment.</p><p>Leverage is maintained below 1x full year adjusted EBITDA, and the group had GBP 61.7 million undrawn facilities at the period-end. This illustrates the financial flexibility the group maintains.</p><p>I will now conclude with current trading and an outlook for 2018. In July, like-for-like revenue is expected to fall by 7%. Although the trading environment for print is expected to remain difficult, the board anticipates trading for the year to be in line with market expectations, with a further increase in newsprint pricing in the second half of the year to be mitigated by further cost reductions and synergies from the acquisition of Express &amp; Star.</p><p>Thank you, all. I'll now pass you back to Simon.</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: Thank you very much, Vijay. I'm going to briefly cover some operational highlights from the first half of the year. I'll remind you of our strategy, and then share a little more detail with you on our plans for the integration of the Express &amp; Star titles. I'll then briefly cover the strategic importance to the group of our regional digital business.</p><p>Print circulation revenue is the largest single revenue component of the group, representing 62% of print revenue and 50% of total group revenue. The line in black on this graph shows the monthly ABC performance of the Daily Mirror, which I know some of you follow, whilst the orange line shows our paid-for circulation.</p><p>Whilst circulation trends remain negative, the paid-for performance of the Daily Mirror over the first 6 months of the year did improve marginally, despite an annual cover price rise of 5p on the 12th of March.</p><p>Our ABC performance has improved as we reach the anniversary of the cessation of free airport copies in May and the change to our Spanish supply arrangements in July.</p><p>We saw a marked improvement in national print advertising in the first half of the year compared to 2017, with mid-single-figure percentage declines. This was a result both of a stronger national print advertising market and also an improved market share performance, both due to the benefit of the World Cup and also to a strong performance from the supermarket and from our own success selling creative solutions to advertisers like Halfords, McDonald's and Smart Energy meters.</p><p>Our digital audience grew in the first half, but more slowly than last year. As you will have seen and heard from other news organizations, this was largely due to the algorithm change from Facebook in January.</p><p>Over the first half, we've put in place a number of measures to drive digital traffic. These include: product improvements to increase our search traffic, a focus on alternative traffic sources such as Twitter and Instagram, and increased efforts to drive traffic directly to our sites and app. In addition, the rebranding of our regional site to the live brand, which I'll come back to in a moment, and the reorganization of regional newsrooms, were already starting to have a positive impact on traffic trends.</p><p>Pleasingly, we've been able to grow our digital yields, and as such, our digital display and transactional revenue has grown ahead of growth in page views.</p><p>Our strategic objective remains to deliver sustainable growth in revenue, profit and cash flow. We've refreshed our strategic pillars following the Express &amp; Star acquisition to optimize, grow and commercialize.</p><p>In respect of optimize, our strategy is to continue to enhance our print brands and to improve their longevity through quality journalism and content delivered as efficiently as possible. Print will, however, not get us to growth, and growing our digital audience and revenue remains our highest priority. We will therefore use the best technology, data and content from across all of our brands to continue growing our digital reach, whilst at the same time improving our revenue performance and seeking out new opportunities and revenue streams to commercialize this growing digital audience.</p><p>Whilst the priority for the year ahead is to deliver the benefits from our recent acquisition, we will consider M&amp;A opportunities which accelerate our strategy and where the financial case meets our requirements.</p><p>Let me now turn to the Express &amp; Star acquisition and start by reminding you of the scale that we now have in both print and digital. Scale matters not only because it will enable us to produce better content at lower cost, but also because it presents a number of revenue opportunities.</p><p>Let me touch on the revenue opportunity. Advertising agencies and clients are increasingly looking to simplify their purchase decisions and deal with a partner that has both the scale and breadth of audience. Our print brands span average ages from 39 to 66. We can reach both male and female audiences as well as the full sociodemographic range. This will make us a first choice partner for advertising agencies. And by November, we will merge 2 currently separate standalone advertising sales teams into 1 best-in-class sales operation. We will ensure that we are easy to buy from and able to offer advertisers the very best in creative media solutions.</p><p>With our significant digital scale, we will also be able to invest in the best digital platforms to both optimize the reader experience and revenue. Our scale enables us to build strong direct relationships with the big tech partners and platforms.</p><p>The combination of 2 national news businesses will enable us to produce better content at lower cost. We're in the process of creating new organizational structures and workflows based on the principle of creating the content once, wherever possible, and thus avoiding unnecessary duplication. We'll be creating new content hubs that will serve all our national brands. These will include breaking news and features such as gardening, motoring, technology and showbiz. A sports hub will enable us to cover a wider breadth of football matches and other sports. We'll be bringing the Scottish Daily Express and Scottish Star into the offices of the Daily Record so that they can benefit from the extensive Scottish content that we have in the group. We will look to reduce the number of picture desks that currently operate across the businesses, and we'll see what opportunities exist for sharing supplements across our titles. We will streamline and simplify the production process wherever possible. We will do all this whilst ensuring we maintain the editorial independence and integrity of each title, in particular respecting the different political stances taken by the Daily Mirror and Daily Express.</p><p>This slide is a real life example taken from last week. The Mirror's David Anderson was in Charlotte in the United States for Liverpool's preseason tour and filed copy about Liverpool's goalkeeping and defensive frailties. One reporter, one story, but treated and presented in different ways to preserve the brand identity and the style of each paper, but using one source of content, just one of many examples of cost-effectiveness without sacrificing quality and professionalism.</p><p>The acquisition brings a new printing plant into our network. Luton is the most modern plant in the country with 22 high-speed print units. Luton, like the rest of our plants, is currently fully utilized, both for printing Express &amp; Star titles but also third-party customers. There are, however, immediate synergies which we can deliver by moving certain print runs across our network to minimize distribution costs. In the longer term, there may be opportunities to rationalize the network, thereby saving more significant costs.</p><p>Let me now turn to our regionals business. And although it's been a tough 6 months, with local advertising in particular performing below our expectations, our regional digital business remains of key strategic importance. Over the past 12 months, we've rebranded all of our regional digital sites except for the Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News to the live brand. We've done this for a number of reasons. Firstly, to clearly indicate to our readers that our digital sites are not simply a copy of the newspaper online. In fact, the content in digital and print is becoming increasingly different, and rightly so. Our digital readers are generally not our print readers. There are more of them, for a start, and they tend to be younger and more likely to be based or working in the city center. Equally, our digital advertisers are increasingly different to our print advertisers. The graph on this slide, which asks readers which characteristic they associate with the name Birmingham Live compared to the previous name of Birmingham Mail, illustrates that the Live brand scores more positively on almost every metric. The Live brand also works well in cities where we've never had a print presence. You may recall we started this in Dublin and Belfast. We launched Leeds Live in November 2017, and Edinburgh Live is coming soon.</p><p>As these 2 graphs show, we've established a strong track record of launching live sites in new locations and quickly scaling them up to become a significant part of the city they serve. Belfast Live is now achieving 7 million page views each month, and Leeds Live achieved 1.7 million page views in the month of June, after just 7 months of operation.</p><p>You've seen this graph before, and it indicates the enormous relevance our digital brands have in the cities they serve, with our larger brands reaching around 50% of the local population over the course of a week.</p><p>In addition to launching in new cities, we continue to look for new content areas or other opportunities where we can use our technology and expertise to grow new audiences. football.london is a great example of this. In just 18 months, it's become our sixth largest regional site, achieving 12.7 million page views in June. We're also seeing good growth from our hyperlocal site, InYourArea, which is a postcode-based content aggregation product, which employs no dedicated journalists.</p><p>We're particularly interested in finding new revenue opportunities beyond traditional advertising. We're experimenting with a wide range of new revenue sources on InYourArea such as trade and property listings. And we also continue to develop transactional revenue streams such as from betting, ticketing and retail.</p><p>And outside of digital, our joint venture events business, Brand Events, has had a strong summer season with our successful Pub in the Park concept having scaled up to 4 events this year with plans for 6 to 8 events in 2019. We've also launched a third Handmade Fair.</p><p>So in summary, it's been a positive financial performance across the first half of the year in a difficult trading environment for the industry, in particular the regionals. And we anticipate trading for the year to be in line with expectations.</p><p>The Express &amp; Star acquisition is a transformational moment for the group, which changes our scale in both print and digital and gives us the opportunity to drive significant cost and revenue synergies. We were pleased to gain competition clearance a few weeks ago, and our integration program is up and running. We have a clear strategy to ensure we crystallize the benefits of this scale to drive profitable growth.</p><p>Thank you for your attention, and Vijay and I would be very happy to take any question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>NICHOLAS MICHAEL EDWARD DEMPSEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nick Dempsey from Barclays. I've got 3, please. First of all, on digital, how do you think about the issue around the Facebook algorithm change? So are we looking at this as -- in early 2019, you anniversary against that and you return to the kind of growth that you would've hoped to have done before because that's behind you? Or are we saying that what they're doing, and Google and other people is permanently reducing your potential to grow in the kind of digital display advertising? Second question, a bit of a follow-on. I mean, Facebook, on the one hand, they're impacting your traffic. On the other hand, they've been taking aggressive share away from print media for 7, 8 years, causing the regulator to have to look at the situation where they can, on the one hand, affect your business; and on the other, benefit from it? And third question, just on the pension. Are we saying the earliest that we could see a reduction in the cash top-ups is 2022 if the -- we've got a March 2021 deadline for the completion of the next actuarial review?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: I'll take the first 2. In terms of Facebook, Facebook made this fundamental change to their News Feed in January, where professional news was reduced overall by 20%. So on average, previously, 5% of people's feeds had professionally produced news in it and that was consciously reduced by them to 4%. Whilst you can never necessarily believe everything, I was at a meeting just last week and they are assuring the news industry that, that is done. So we would expect to see -- we would expect to see an anniversary effect. In addition, they are now starting to prioritize certain publishers based on 3 upweight factors. One of those is local, which, of course, should benefit us; at the second is trusted, which should also benefit us; and the third is informative. So I think initially, they took a pretty aggressive approach to all news providers. I would expect to see us starting to benefit as the dial is turned slightly in our favor. What they're fighting is essentially fake news on the platform. And I think in order to address fake news, to some degree, they've had to address all news. And as they get more sophisticated, I think they will be able to differentiate between the two. The other thing though is we've taken a conscious decision to be increasingly less reliant on Facebook as a source for news. We still believe it should be important. That is where people spend their time, and if people are spending their time there, we want our content to be there but we don't want to become overly reliant, and hence, our clear strategy to sort of diversify traffic sources. On regulation, I wouldn't hold my breath greatly. There are a number of reviews ongoing, including the Cairncross Review into the sustainability of the press. I think the government and the DCMS just reported yesterday on their fake news inquiry. So the government is definitely concerned about the impact on news from the platforms, but I wouldn't necessarily hold my breath and expect the cavalry to come charging over the hill. I think we have to assume that nothing much will change. And on pensions?</p><p>VIJAY LAKHMAN VAGHELA: Yes. So the valuation date is December '19, so we would expect to complete that by the end of 2020. So we would expect an impact on contributions from '21, not '22.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: ...Numis, 2 for me. Firstly, can you talk a little bit about the different digital strategies for the Express and Mirror? I mean, they seem to be doing pretty well on the digital side. Is there stuff you can learn from and implement across the sort of the broad organization? And then secondly, I think you suggested Specialist Digital will fall again in H2. Can you just talk a little bit there on sort of what's hurting, what the -- will be the medium- to longer-term strategies for that asset?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: I'll do the first one, and you do the second one. So what we're going through right now is an in-depth learning period to really understand what are the Express doing well, particularly digitally. We want to make sure that we take the very best from both organizations and bring that together. And what we're learning is that the Express have done particularly well around search, so they have optimized their sites for Google, perhaps better than we have. And in fact, the other way around, they're doing particularly poorly on Facebook, which, to some degree, has played in their favor. But actually, they should be accessible on Facebook, just as we should be accessible on search. So what we're exactly trying to do is take the best from both. We want to improve the Mirror's search. We want to improve the Express' Facebook approach. The other thing, they are doing some interesting work around focusing less on breaking news and really choosing which topics to cover in enormous detail. So the number of articles that they write on Brexit, for example, is very, very significant. They covered the royal wedding in huge detail. So rather than necessarily trying to cover the entire news spectrum, they're focusing on topics. And actually, that's quite interesting, and that's been working for them. So we very much expect to be able to optimize the 2 to the benefits of both. And on Specialist Digital...?</p><p>VIJAY LAKHMAN VAGHELA: Yes. Specialist Digital, I think, it's a relatively small business, so it has 2 elements, which is recruitment -- online recruitment, and digital marketing services, which largely focused on email marketing. So the revenue streams are volatile in that market, especially in digital marketing services, where you have one client one month, you may not have him the other month. So the decline doesn't reflect -- in the first half doesn't reflect a continuing decline every month. There are months of growth and there are months of decline. In the second half, we don't expect further deterioration. I think there'll be volatility in the second half but -- for example, July, at the moment, is looking flat to marginally up for those digital, so it's just volatility. There's nothing underlying driving that trend. And in terms of your second question, I think we've said in the past, they are probably marginally less core than other parts of the business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: There's a question on the webcast. The question is from Alex DeGroote from DeGroote Consulting. What is your intuition regarding the impact of a hard Brexit on advertising in 2018? What planning, if any, can you undertake?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: That's a good question, Alex. I mean, I think that advertising is clearly dependent on confidence. And I think if there were to be a hard Brexit, we would see some advertisers impacted. As to the timing of that and the impact of that, it's really hard to tell. So if you want to add anything?</p><p>VIJAY LAKHMAN VAGHELA: No. I think it's just -- I think it's the scale of the Brexit and terms of the Brexit will also impact confidence. So I think it's difficult to see what impact on confidence will be unless we're clear on the actual terms of the Brexit itself.</p><p>THOMAS A SINGLEHURST, DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF EUROPEAN MEDIA RESEARCH, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom here from Citigroup. A couple of questions actually on advertising and then one on cash usage. On advertising, you mentioned supermarkets have rebounded somewhat. Is that just a flash in the pan because there was hot weather and lots of barbecues? Or is there something more fundamental behind that? Maybe you've reached inflection there. You also flagged sort of a creative approach to selling print advertising. I wonder whether if you could just give a bit more detail on that. And then on the cash usage side, I mean, obviously, one of the key inferences of the whole Express &amp; Star transaction is, I mean, not only the potential for cost savings and efficiency but also suddenly, you're upweighted to national advertising. Is there anything else that one could do to get more weight into national by M&amp;A?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: Not a flash in the pan, not just due to the summer barbecue, although that, of course, helps. Particularly with Tesco, we enter into reasonably long-term relationships with the supermarkets and the deal that we've done with Tesco is a reasonably long term one. So the return to print of certain brands, I think, is a sign of the pendulum swinging in our direction a little bit, a recognition that the pendulum may have swung too far to digital media and the traditional media still play a role and still deliver advertisers very strong ROIs. And that's, I think, been recognized certainly by the bookmakers. They've always been strong advertisers for us, and we did have a World Cup effect, of course, with the bookmakers. But with food, with advertisers like McDonald's, these are, I think, long-term shifts to print. Creative solutions, as we call it, is where we don't just take the advertisers' artwork. We help them craft the story, and that is becoming increasingly important. I've probably given the example of smart energy meters before because that's a several-year contract where every household in the country has to upgrade their electricity meter and their gas meter to a smart meter. And that isn't something that people wake up in the morning thinking that they must do. So we have been working with them, for example, in creating the stories, the narrative that drives people to pick up the phone and book an appointment. And U.K. TV, LloydsPharmacy, Halfords and others are clients who ask them to help them tell the story as well as just receive their finished artwork. In terms of other M&amp;A activity, I think our focus is clearly going to be on integrating the Express &amp; Star. If you look at the wider national market, there aren't hundreds of opportunities, it will be interesting to see clearly what happens with Johnston Press in the coming months and years. Obviously, they own the i, the Telegraph is -- who knows? But I think our focus will be integrating the Express &amp; Star.</p><p>JONATHAN MARK HELLIWELL, MEDIA ANALYST, PANMURE GORDON &amp; CO. PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Jonathan at Panmure's. Just a couple of things for me. First is now you've got magazines in the portfolio and had a look inside those. Where do they lie on the spectrum of profitability, viability, feasibility, et cetera? I think you mentioned advertising was tough, I mean, in the first half. Do they get hit by paper prices in the same degree as the newspaper titles? Second thing is, slightly following from the M&amp;A point, you obviously went through a long process with the CMA. What are your conclusions coming out of that on how this industry might develop over the next few years? How far it comes for -- can it go to unified, one newspaper company like Al Ahad TV, like we've touched on before? What are the practical constraints, and they being both a national and regional group, impact on that whole debate?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: Starting on magazines. I think the answer is they are on the more precarious end of the scale. The circulation and advertising trends in magazine is poor. We have 3 paid-for magazines. Within that, really, OK! is the flagship. The other 2 are definitely on the precarious end, and we will be looking at a number of initiatives to ensure that we can keep them profitable. Really, if we can't keep them profitable, there are inevitable consequences from that. But they were not the reason we did the deal. And we will, however, work on optimizing their lifespan as best as we can, particularly OK!, where I think there may be some brand-extension opportunities. Paper prices affects the magazines less just because there are fewer of them, so it's not paper prices, they're not the big issue. I think what we learned from the CMA process is that I think they understand the industry. They haven't looked at our industry for many, many years. I think it was helpful that they did that. Obviously, we came to a good conclusion and a relatively swift conclusion so I think they do understand the pressures that the industry is under. And I think that they would be more open, particularly perhaps to collaboration and consolidation. They'll need to look at each -- the merits of each particular deal. But I think they do recognize that the industry needs perhaps to work more closely together. One of the things that is going on at the moment is a digital collaboration of news brands, and I think they'd be completely open to those sorts of combined sales houses, for example, or not all -- combined sales approach, I should say. I think you also...</p><p>JONATHAN MARK HELLIWELL: Just about the, is the regional, does it matter -- do they pick those 2 markets and they put them together?</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: Yes, they do look at them as 2 markets, absolutely, very much so. And that's -- I think they would still prefer a regional consolidation. They would look at sort of postcode level or market-by-market level.</p><p>Check whether there are any questions on the phone.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no questions over the audio at this time.</p><p>SIMON RICHARD FOX: Very good. Thank you all very much, indeed.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Mark Brayan, CEO. Thank you. Please go ahead.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN, MD, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, APPEN LIMITED: Thanks, Jenny. And hello and welcome, everybody, to the conference call for our first half results for 2019. Thank you, once again for your interest in the company, and thanks for joining the call.</p><p>I'm joined today by our CFO, Kevin Levine, and you'll hear from him later on in the call. Per the intro, we'll walk through the presentation, and then we'll open the call for questions.</p><p>So let's get underway. If you could turn to Page 4, first of all, for the results highlights. Look, the company has undoubtedly delivered once again for our customers, our staff, our crowd workers and of course, our shareholders. Revenue for the half, up to -- up to $245.1 million. That's a 60% increase on the first half of last year. Underlying EBITDA of $46.3 million was up 81%. At the same time and very pleasingly, our underlying EBITDA margin expanded from 16.8% to 18.9%. This is as a result of economies of scale and our investments in tech-led productivity improvements as they took effect this half. Underlying NPAT was also up on the last half -- sorry, on the first half of last year to be correct by 67% to $29.6 million.</p><p>From a divisional perspective, and these numbers on Page 4 relate to our core operating divisions and are independent of Figure Eight. Revenue for Speech &amp; Image data of $39.9 million was up 85% on the first half of last year, and Relevance data was up 48% to $193.7 million. Now for those of you that have followed us for a while, Speech &amp; Image data was formerly referred to as Language Resources, but we've renamed it given its broader emit that now includes other data types such as image and video. Relevance data refers, of course, to our former Content Relevance division.</p><p>We're very pleased to declare a dividend of $0.04 a share. This is partially franked. This is consistent with last year's interim dividend and in line with our ongoing review of capital management.</p><p>Finally, Leapforce is now fully integrated and providing margin benefits, and Figure Eight is delivering on its thesis. More on both of these later in the presentation.</p><p>Turning to Page 5 and the divisional results. And at the outset of -- just explaining that we've restructured the business to be closer to the customer. That is we now sell Speech &amp; Image data which was sold from Language Resources, and Content Relevance data or Relevance data, which was sold from the Content Relevance or CR division. We share resources across these divisions now. So we've allocated those resources largely based on revenue, and we've restated the 2018 numbers on this same basis. So the comparisons which you're getting on these page are on a like-for-like -- like-for-like comparison.</p><p>So first, Speech &amp; Image. This is really gathering speed. The first half last year, we did $21.5 million, and then we topped that in the second half of last year with a revenue result of $29.9 million. And that's now being bettered this half with revenue of $39.9 million. So in round figures, the business has moved from $20 million to $30 million to $40 million in successive halves.</p><p>I'm often asked when will the world have enough speech data, and I can confidently say and this trend shows that I don't think it will be for quite a while. Our customers are continuing to ask for more data in many languages for new products and to improve their existing products. And it's not just audio speech data. We also provide text data for language-based products such as chat box, for example. The reason they need more data is that human speech and language is complex and building technology that mimics it is a very hard problem to solve. And the solution lies in more data, and we're happy to play our role by continuing to provide very large volumes of high-quality data for all manner of speech and natural language product.</p><p>Speech &amp; Image, as the new name suggests, also provides image and video data. It's a growth area for us and one that requires special labeling technology. We're able to participate in it more fully now following the acquisition of Figure Eight.</p><p>Our Relevance business continues to be the cornerstone of the company. Revenue of $193.7 million in the first half was up 48% on the same period last year. This was largely from our anchor technology companies across new and existing projects, but we're also adding new Relevance customers as well.</p><p>Our technology-led productivity initiatives and economies of scale helped us grow our Relevance margins. And remember that this is on a like-for-like comparison with the prior half -- or the prior corresponding half. And we also continued, at the same time, to deliver high-quality work to our customers and fair wages to our crowd workers.</p><p>To Page 6 now and Figure Eight. Our investment in Figure Eight is delivering on its thesis. It's accelerating and derisking our technology strategy, and tech is essential to our business. It's diversifying our revenue and it's expanding our markets, most notably into the government market, of which more later.</p><p>Figure Eight's technology in the engineering, product and machine learning teams have been a very positive addition to the company. We are now firmly a data and machine learning technology company, building on our established brand as a language company. The Figure Eight platform is proven to be deeper than originally thought. And its security features, including its SOC 2 compliance, and this is a certification that relates to the security, availability, integrity and the data confidentiality of SaaS-based systems, is proving to be invaluable, particularly in the current climate of increasing scrutiny on data privacy.</p><p>The achievement of planned synergies and the path to profitability are on track, as is our full year EBITDA outlook. However, despite a strong first quarter, Q2 sales and retention were not where we would have liked them. The acquisition was distracting for staff, and it cost us some sales momentum. The sales team is also necessarily shifting to chase bigger deals, and some of these slipped outside the quarter.</p><p>That said, we've implemented some remedies and added management support from Appen. Our new Global Head of Sales, Jon Kondo, is spending much of his time with the Figure Eight team. Jon has a strong pedigree in sales growth and SaaS companies in particular, and his efforts are yielding benefits. We have over 30 cross-sell opportunities between Figure Eight and Appen, and the third quarter is off to a nice start.</p><p>We've revised our full year ARR target for Figure Eight, and we note that the revision had an immaterial effect on the overall Appen results. And further, investors are protected by the earn-out structure.</p><p>We view the current performance as temporary and retain a high conviction in Figure Eight and its thesis over the mid- to long term.</p><p>It's also worth noting that another company in our space called Scale recently raised capital at a valuation of $1 billion. And that was well up from its previous valuation less than 18 months ago of $93 million. And regardless of what you think of the valuation, this shows genuine interest in the data annotation market and reinforces the value of Figure Eight to Appen and to our future.</p><p>So we provide an updated customer cohort chart on Page 7. The chart shows our customers by annual cohort and the revenue for each cohort each successive year. We are clearly getting repeat and growing revenue from a number of these cohorts. The blue bars shows Speech &amp; Image data revenue for the first half of this year, almost on par with the full year for 2017. And the red bars show Relevance revenue. While results are dominated by 2 customer cohorts, the repeat nature of that revenue underscores the importance of the data we provide to our customers and the quality of the work and service that we deliver. You'll also notice that Figure Eight hits the chart for the first time with the yellow bar for the first half of 2019.</p><p>To Page 8 and an update on our technology strategy. Recall that our investments in technology enable us to compete, deepen the moats around our business and future-proof the business. I'm very pleased to say that our tech team are now led capably by our CTO, Wilson Pang, is delivering on that vision. And the tech team incidentally includes engineers from both Appen and Figure Eight working side by side under Wilson's leadership.</p><p>We rely on 3 core platform illustrated on the top right-hand side of the page: our crowd management platform, Appen Connect, acquired from Leapforce, helps us recruit, test, onboard, provide instruction, monitor quality and pay our crowd workers. We're paying in the order of 40,000 workers per month, and that number has peaked at over 18,000 workers. This system is the foundation of the business of our scale and fundamental to our performance. Our client workspace, acquired with Figure Eight, enables customers to fulfill their data needs through a SaaS-based interface. They can scribe their data requirements and quality standards, send jobs to crowd workers and manage data quality, all through an agile web-based interface. And our annotation tools, some of which are from Figure Eight and some from Appen, are used by crowd workers to collect and annotate data to the clients' requirements.</p><p>We're investing into the usability and automation of these tools to improve the worker experience and, of course, their productivity. We're delivering exciting new features across these platforms, including enhanced security features, very necessary in the current climate. We're also using advanced techniques such as machine learning to automate annotation tasks. We're already seeing productivity improvements from automated quality checking of transcription, for example.</p><p>Now remember that our crowd is one of our greatest assets, but it's also a large expense. So improvements in productivity go to a better crowd experience and better margins. We need to invest in technology to run, improve and future-proof the business. And the small table at the bottom of the page shows the substantial increase in investment from the first half of last year. This is an important part of our transition to a tech-led business.</p><p>Over to Page 9 and a brief update on the acquisitions. Leapforce is now fully integrated into Appen. The Appen Connect system came with Leapforce, and in addition to the system's recruiting and crowd management capabilities, we gained comprehensive project and resource management functionality as well as quality management and reporting features. The integration of Leapforce included a root and branch review of all of our crowd and customer-facing processes, the implementation of Appen Connect to codify these processes and in comprehensive training and change management to enable our recruiting and customer teams.</p><p>Appen Connect also enabled the restructure around the customer, where we share resources now across Speech &amp; Image projects, Relevance projects, et cetera. It was a nontrivial exercise, but we're already seeing resulting productivity benefits and has set the business up for far greater scale.</p><p>We've yet to fully embark on the integration of Figure Eight. It's running as is under the leadership of its COO, Becky Scott, to deliver the earn-out. But Appen management is leaning into coach -- scoping integration and set the business up for future success.</p><p>Independent of the integration, Figure Eight is providing us with substantial benefits, including in us in a great position in the government market. This is highlighted on Page 10. The Figure Eight platform is being deployed behind government firewalls for large-scale data annotation for government AI projects. This is no mean feat. It required rigorous testing for the highest technical security standards and swift and agile responses from Figure Eight engineers to respond to issues and satisfy these standards.</p><p>It's interesting that the government came to Silicon Valley and Figure Eight rather than traditional government tech providers and shows both the uniqueness of Figure Eight solution and the government's intent to invest in AI. Also the secure deployment of Figure Eight is a high barrier to entry, and it sets us up to fully serve the customers and participate in what can be a substantial opportunity for the company.</p><p>Page 11, we continue to invest in China, the second-largest AI market, and maybe the largest one day. We welcome Dr. Roc Tian to the management team as our Head of China. Roc has a strong technology pedigree through his career with IBM and HP in China as well as a PhD in computer science. His background with U.S. firms and China brings valuable cross-cultural business experience, and he operates with a high degree of communication. He's also hit the ground running, building the team and working with our customers.</p><p>Our data labeling facility in Wuxi, which is west of Shanghai, is implemented and operable. It's similar to our Philippine center but currently at a smaller scale.</p><p>I'd now like to hand it over to Kevin to take us through the financial pages of the presentation.</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE, CFO, APPEN LIMITED: Thanks, Mark. And once again, it is a real privilege to report on such great result. The revenue increase of 60% has been driven by both divisions as well as Figure Eight. Out of the 60% growth, organic growth represented 53% and Figure Eight represented 7%. Growth of 85% in Speech &amp; Image over the prior period was a standout and mainly came from expansion of existing projects continuing on from the previous half. There was also some growth in new projects. Relevance growth excluding Figure Eight of 48% was driven by major customers with growth in existing and new projects.</p><p>Underlying EBITDA was up 81%. This was achieved by efficiencies from the Leapforce integration as well as efficiencies from other process improvement initiatives. As we get bigger, we get better, and we continue to derive economies of scale.</p><p>Underlying NPAT was up 67%. This was mainly impacted by movement in effective tax rates to 28.2% from 21.2% in the prior comparative period where the prior period rate was abnormally low. In the prior period, the share-based payment deduction was significantly larger than the share-based payment expense, and that gets added back to taxable income, and that resulted in an abnormally lower tax expense.</p><p>Moving on to Slide 14 and to the balance sheet. Appen continues to strengthen its balance sheet. Receivables have increased due to increased volumes as well as the addition of Figure Eight. Noncurrent assets have increased significantly, mainly as a result of the Figure Eight acquisition. Of this increase of $311 million, goodwill associated with the Figure Eight acquisition represents $281 million and capitalization of rental leases represents $22 million.</p><p>Based on the revised Figure Eight ARR forecast, the corresponding estimated future value earn-out payment rate is $36 million to $50 million. The estimated earn-out liability has been booked at the low end of this range in order to be conservative.</p><p>Debt has significantly reduced. $45 million of debt was repaid during the period. $21 million was repaid as part of the capital raise in March, and the balance of $24 million was sourced from our own cash reserves. As a result of the low debt levels, Appen is in a net debt negative position of $59 million. Essentially, we have more cash than debt. And this compares with net debt leverage of 1.1x at the time of the Leapforce acquisition in December '17 and 0.26x at December '18.</p><p>Moving on to Slide 15 and our cash flow. Appen continues to execute well on converting earnings to cash and thereby increasing cash presence. Cash increased by $40 million in the period, driven by a 98% increase in cash flow from operations. Cash was directed to repay debt, fund CapEx and pay dividends in the period. And cash flow conversion increased to 92% from 84%.</p><p>On Slide 16, we talk about the impact of currency. And the Appen performance benefited from a weak Australian dollar in the period. Excluding the ForEx translation tailwinds, revenue and underlying EBITDA increased by 47% and 63%, respectively. And the EBITDA uplift that came from the ForEx translation, the spread between that and Appen, would be in accordance with each division's relevant earnings.</p><p>I'll now hand you back to Mark. Thank you.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Thanks, Kevin. So to Page 16 now. The AI market continues to grow very strongly. There's no doubt of that. There are many indicators and some are on the page. Gartner, for example, a leading tech analyst that many of you know, estimates that the number of AI projects per organization will grow at over 100% a year. KPMG found that most business have some adoption plans for AI varying in maturity from pilot projects to scaling up to in production and industrialize. And this is across a wide variety of use cases. Now none of this growth is possible without high-quality training data, and we're playing our role admirably in this regard.</p><p>Over to Page 17. We're uniquely and strongly positioned to win in this market. We have unparalleled suite of technologies, a proven and highly scalable crowd capability and an enviable track record. And as previously stated, our Speech &amp; Image growth rate of, in round numbers, $20 million to $30 million to $40 million over the last 3 halves illustrates this demand, the data and our ability to deliver at scale. Our customers are demanding, but we meet those demands, and we continually improve to exceed them and meet the next.</p><p>Finally to Page 18 for the summary and the outlook. We're really pleased to present the results and assure you that we remain committed to strengthening our position and continuing the company's growth in the dynamic market for AI training data. We'll continue to invest in technology, sales and marketing and the government markets in China in particular to achieve these objectives.</p><p>Our 2019 order book is in good shape with year-to-date revenue plus orders in hand for delivery in 2019 at approximately $380 million at mid-August. This includes Figure Eight. Our full year underlying EBITDA outlook for 2019 is trending to the upper end of the range of $85 million to $90 million. This also includes Figure Eight.</p><p>A few notes on the earnings figures. The second half is struck at a U.S. exchange rate of $0.74. We realize this is higher than the rate today, but it's our practice to maintain the rate that we struck at the beginning of the year for consistency. Note also that it took 3 months of Figure Eight losses in the first half amounting to $2.6 million and will take 6 months of losses in the second half. And the first half result benefited from a ForEx gain of $4.7 million.</p><p>Before we open for questions, I would like to thank our customers for their support, our global crowd for the work they do for us and the hard work, commitment and friendship of everyone at Appen and Figure Eight with a special thank you to Kevin for everything he does for everyone on the call and for all of our shareholders.</p><p>Pleasure working with such a great team and a pleasure to report the results of their efforts to all of you. So thank you. I'll now hand the call back to Jenny to open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Quinn Pierson from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>QUINN MCCOMAS PIERSON, CO-HEAD OF THE SMALL CAP RESEARCH, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess just firstly on Figure Eight and the slowing of the revenue growth there. So you've highlighted some transaction disruption. You've highlighted some, I guess, chasing some of the larger deals. But presumably, that would have been kind of known or understood when you were providing original guidance on that ARR growth rate. So could you maybe just talk us through kind of what is new or what has changed since March that has slowed the revenue growth momentum down?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. Quinn, I think, as we said, the transaction itself was more destabilizing than we thought for the team. It's the youngest team in a very dynamic environment in the Bay Area, and a lot of people were sort of fearful for their jobs initially and that kind of put them into a little bit of a funk, unfortunately. The good news was that the staff retention rates were high. So it didn't result in us losing staff, but it did result in some deal disruption.</p><p>The other thing, and you may noticed also is that these businesses are very highly tuned towards the end of the quarter. So what we see in March and April and even May can be very different to what we see come the 30th of June in this instance. The end of the quarter is when the large deals are signed or re-signed or in this case, some of them not signed. So there was a bit of a swift transition to the visibility.</p><p>The good news is going into Q3, we're off to a fast start. Retention rates are high. And Jon Kondo, as I mentioned, has settled the team down and starting to add a lot of value there. So we're pretty confident with things going forward. We also are supportive of their push to focus on larger deals because we think the larger deals are out there, and we think that's how they're going to add a lot more value to the business.</p><p>QUINN MCCOMAS PIERSON: That's helpful. And secondly and related to that, I think I heard you say that you're still confident on the previous targets, which was second half '20 profitability for Figure Eight stand-alone. So I guess could you just kind of confirm I heard that correctly? And if that is the case, then presumably, that would mean your FY '20 revenue growth would be even higher than you had previously thought? In other words, kind of make up for the FY '19 disruption? Is that how to be thinking about it?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: So definitely, you're correct on the first question on profit. In terms of the full year next year, as we go into our planning towards the end of this year and as we bring the businesses together, clearly, we'll get an accelerating effect from the integration into Appen. But exactly how that will manifest itself is a little early to say at this point.</p><p>QUINN MCCOMAS PIERSON: Okay. Just to be clear there, so are you still confident in the second half '20 profitability? Is there a chance that maybe the cost base would be lower to get there? So not necessarily the revenue hitting original expectations but kind of the net profit. Is that part of the...</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. It's a combination of revenue and cost management. So our -- we're managing the cost a little more prudently perhaps than the business did on its own. And obviously, the -- we're confident in the Q3 and the Q4 revenue to get us to that that EBITDA target by the end of the year.</p><p>QUINN MCCOMAS PIERSON: Helpful. And then just lastly, on your full year guidance. So you're tracking towards the top end of the range. It'd be $90 million. So if we look at $46 million of first half EBITDA, that implies about $44 million of second half EBITDA. So I'm cognizant there is a little bit of annualization of Figure Eight losses. But even kind of including that, call it kind of a somewhat flattish outcome there. Is there -- are there any kind of first half projects that will be rolling off to be cognizant of? Or is it more, I guess, a matter of conservatism where you're not baking in, I guess, potential or likely new work later in the year? I'm just trying to reconcile the first half, second half profit split.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. So you've got to take the impact of the foreign exchange into account, Quinn. We record actual results at the exchange rate on the day that we forecast the forward period, in this case, the second half at $0.74. So there's a dampening effect on the second half forecast due to currency. And as I explained or stated in the presentation, that's just been our practice. This year, it happened to swing quite a bit. So there was a $4.7 million benefit from currency in the first half. And you can assume that there will be some currency benefit in the second half. And overall, when you take into account currency benefits and the Figure Eight losses, we see growth from -- growth in the second half on the first half.</p><p>QUINN MCCOMAS PIERSON: Yes. Just at spot right now for FX, what would be the implied earnings uplift if you use that?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: I think you're going to have to do your own sums, Quinn.</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Quinn, what you can do is you can look at the movement in H1 and you can see if that correlated to the $4.7 million. And essentially, if the currency movement is around there or similar, well then, that could point towards a similar kind of outcome.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Garry Sherriff from Royal Bank of Canada.</p><p>GARRY SHERRIFF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; HEAD OF AUSTRALIAN TECHNOLOGY AND SMALL-MID CAPS, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark and Kevin, just a question around F Eight, particularly around the earn-outs. So it sounds like that earn-out has dropped materially. Can you just remind us what it was previously? Because I think you're now guiding to $36 million to $50 million earn-out.</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Yes, Garry. So basically, the earn-out is based on ARR contracted to the end of December. So essentially, what this means is any deals that really kick the ground up before the end of the year go into the mix. And the guidance we provided previously was USD 62 million -- sorry, just to be clear, USD 60 million to USD 80 million.</p><p>GARRY SHERRIFF: Okay. And again, you've got a number of figures here around Figure Eight in relation to ARR, and you've talked about being below plan at a certain line and then at plan at the EBITDA line. I wonder just for clarity, are you able to just tell us what those plans were? Because you're now saying ARR has dropped. So I'm just wondering what you're going for before. And also you're now staying that -- saying that EBITDA remains in a planned range. Can you just maybe just be a bit clearer on what those figures are?</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: So essentially, yes, but when -- the work plan, you should read into the guidance, the guidance we provided at the time when we announced the acquisition. So we gave -- basically, we gave '18 numbers for Figure Eight. And then we basically said, okay, from an EBITDA perspective, what we expected, it was going to be a 25% to 35% reduction in the '18 number. And so what we -- we're confirming that position. There's no change in that. And once again, the note when we're talking about ARR, it references back to the guidance that we gave at the time of the acquisition.</p><p>GARRY SHERRIFF: All right. Your year-to-date revenue plus orders on hand, last year, that ratio in terms of delivery to revenue was about 70%. Now should we be assuming a similar ratio conversion for '19?</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: There's a few factors that impact it, Garry. We -- as we win more customers, we get a better spread of revenue through the year, so which is to say that there are bigger orders to come year-on-year. So it's a good starting point, but it's going to vary year-on-year, but it's a good starting point.</p><p>GARRY SHERRIFF: Final question on capital management. You've stated an ongoing review of capital management priorities, including your dividend policy. You've just got net cash of $59 million. Can you just remind us what your current dividend policy is and maybe give us a sense of whether you're planning to build up more of a cash war chest for future growth? Or are we thinking that's not the case and now you're going to lift the payout ratio? I just wanted to be a bit clearer around that if possible.</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Yes. So we don't have a sort of a stated policy on dividend, Garry. And we are -- we've got some debt now. So we need to manage that. To the extent to which we can find attractive opportunity for acquisition, having more cash for that is always handy and also having cash to invest into such markets as the U.S. government market and the Chinese market. So I think you certainly get the view from us that we like to do things reasonably conservatively, and we think that using that cash for investment is probably a good thing to do.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Paul Mason from Evans &amp; Partners.</p><p>PAUL MASON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY, EVANS &amp; PARTNERS PTY. LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few from me. The first one, your investment in engineering at $13.1 million. Can I just get some context around that. I thought you'd sort of guided to about a $6 million annual budget for that for this year. Can you maybe -- I know I've got a $6 million number from one of your presentations, but maybe just explain the differences going on there? Is that just actually much more expense? Or was that $6 million like an incremental thing and I'm officially interpreting history wrong?</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Paul, so the $6 million figure was initially savings from the integration of Leapforce. That will be plowed into R&amp;D prior to the acquisition of Figure Eight. When we made the acquisition of Figure Eight, we were still using most of that $6 million for R&amp;D. But of course, we ended up where we are now spending more than the $6 million on R&amp;D because we have a larger team of engineers and data scientists and product managers. So that $13 million figure refers to the total spend in engineering across Appen and Figure Eight. So the $6 million is buried within it, but the reason it's gone up so dramatically is because we've added the Figure Eight engineering team.</p><p>PAUL MASON: Okay. So just on margins in Speech &amp; Image. So second half last year, you guys saw like effectively like a very down year. I think your explanation at the time was that a whole bunch of government or secure facility work at least anyway had temporarily disappeared. And you were flagging it was coming back. Is that the big driver of the margin recovery in this half? Or is that more attributable to like the Speech &amp; Image recognition stuff, the AI that's gone in as opposed to sort of the more legacy parts of that business that were lower margin historically?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. So we haven't seen a strong return to that previous very high margin government work. But the revenue growth in Speech &amp; Image is coming largely from the technology sector, from commercial clients. And the margins are sort of generally consistent. And just for clarity, the government work that I referred to with Figure Eight is in a different part of the government altogether. So it's not that very high-value speech -- or very high margin speech work that we have historically enjoyed. So overall, the revenue growth is coming from the tech sector and the margins are about where they were.</p><p>PAUL MASON: Okay. And just sort of last one for me. On the Leapforce integration, just noting what you -- sort of in your prior answer that you'd flagged $6 million of savings for this year. But just going through the Slide 7, it sort of indicates that in Relevance, about 50% is done at the moment. And then in speech, image and video, you're expecting stuff to migrate in Q2. Could you -- so just 2 elements to this, if you could. Just in terms of what you said, Q1 and Q2, is that a reference to like sort of financial year Q1 and Q2 or calendar year Q1 and Q2 like Q1 ending in September? Or does it end in March? And then secondarily, given that there's clearly like not a -- it's not a 100% run rate, could you give us an idea of like the annualized full -- efficiency benefit given $6 million has clearly got like a ramp profile for it?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: I don't know -- sorry, Paul, I don't know if I understand your question. Can you break it down a bit? There's a whole bunch of stuff in there.</p><p>PAUL MASON: Maybe I'll ask it as 2 questions then. So just the first one, on Slide 7, you've made comments about Relevance projects getting onto Appen Connect, 50% now or by the end of Q1. And then for speech, image, video work, end of Q2 on Appen Connect. And so can you just clarify what Q1 and Q2 means in terms of the exact dates, how you're chopping the year off?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: I think you might be using an older presentation, Paul.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Josh Kannourakis from UBS.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS, RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just first question around the Relevance division. So obviously, you mentioned some restatement there. But the delta in margins year-on-year are actually really large. And I guess just trying to understand a little bit more context around how those margins changed from second half '18 as well and whether you expect sort of a continued benefit and just maybe a little bit around where that benefit is coming from, obviously, a strong result.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. Thanks. So there's 3 sources of the benefit. One is step change. The other 2 should continue to yield benefits going forward. The first is just the full integration of the Leapforce work. Leapforce operated at higher margins than Appen historically due to its high degree of efficiency. And so just blending the Leapforce work and the Appen work gave us a lift of margins, the first source. The second source is technology-led productivity improvements. So we've implemented the Leapforce platform now across all of our projects, Speech &amp; Image and our Relevance projects. And that just improves efficiency and goes to margin. And then the third source is just economies of scale. The bigger the projects get, the bigger the business gets. We get to share cost and that goes to margin as well.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Got it. And so in terms of the continued -- the benefit throughout the year, have we seen a full heat-up of, I guess, the -- especially the tech-led and obviously Leapforce-led benefit within this first half? Like is there any more benefits to come in the second half?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: So there should be to the extent that we don't get price pressure. So remember that the thesis around technology is to improve productivity through technology and position us to manage price pressure if it should come along. So we've always targeted, at a group level, margins in the mid-teens. We've exceeded that at the moment. And we continue to deliver technology that improves productivity, but of course, we can't predict price pressure at this point.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Got it. That was actually my next question. Just to get a little bit of context, Mark, around the customer environment and what you're seeing out there in terms of pricing across some of your large clients.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: So the larger the clients, the greater the demand for volume discount. And we work with our clients in that regard. But most of the pressure that we see comes from demand more so than price at this point. We are being proactive with our customers to provide them with good pricing. And they're very happy in that regard. But we also have seen most of our pressure on the demand side. And our ability to scale up with crowd workers, for example, is very helpful in that regard.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Got it. And so just following on from that though. In terms of, I guess, the competitive landscape, are you seeing any new entrants in your core markets? Obviously, we talked about some other guys on the autonomous side like Scale AI and the like, which you mentioned earlier, but in your sort of core Relevance markets, in social media and search, it's the still same players, no new entrants at the moment?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: That's correct.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Okay. Great. And then just final one. Just in terms of the Speech &amp; Image division, are you able to give any context around just what amount of sort of speech versus image? I imagine image is small, but just to try and get some context on how that part of the business has been growing.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. The bulk of it is speech work. And as I said in the presentation, our ability to participate at scale in the image and video world requires certain technologies, which we now have with the acquisition of Figure Eight. So Speech &amp; Image is predominantly speech and other natural language data. But we're confident we'll see more image and video data going forward.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Got it. And just in terms of the cost base, corporate overhead, so is it fair to expect that to sort of continue at a similar run rate into the second half? Or is there any other sort of movements we should be aware about?</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Yes. Josh, I think that's indicative of normalization. Obviously, we'll -- if there's special areas we need to invest in to further grow, we'll do that. But if you look at -- we finished -- full year '18 was $11.1 million, 6.5 for the first half year. That's indicative of the best view of what we have right now with corporate overhead.</p><p>JOSH CHARLES KANNOURAKIS: Yes, yes. And definitely final one for me. You mentioned the $13 million -- I think Paul mentioned the $13 million invested in the business. Can you just give a bit of context around what was, I guess, capitalized versus what was expense of that? Or was that just a pure expense number?</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: So that's the total investment. And if you go back to the guidance and generally our policy, it's a 3-year amortization policy. So essentially work on -- essentially 1/3 of that is being capitalized and 2/3 is being expensed.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Adam Dellaverde from Taylor Collison.</p><p>ADAM DELLAVERDE, EQUITIES ANALYST, TAYLOR COLLISON LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just as we talk about retaining cash for acquisitions, I'm just interested in your thoughts in terms of deploying capital into China, maybe in the context of one of the big tech companies in the U.S. being criticized for aiding the Chinese government indirectly.</p><p>KEVIN B. LEVINE: Adam, yes, I don't know how to answer that question. We're going to be fairly prudent in the way we deploy cash into China to manage the risk of our business. How that impacts the way -- yes, I'm not 100% sure what you're after, but I will say that we're going to be fairly prudent in the way we deploy the company's cash in China.</p><p>ADAM DELLAVERDE: Sorry, maybe I'll -- I guess I'm just alert to on the risk side, you did this fantastic business growing like crazy with sort of, let's say, Western customer base. As you push into China, how do you protect systems? How do you protect data? How do you do that to make sure that those customers are happy and all of the work you're doing for them is sort of siloed? And how do you hire, I guess?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. No, that makes sense. So we are very aware of the risk of the nature of our business in China, being a data-based business. So we have deployed a completely separate tech stack into China. So our core platforms, our Appen Connect platform and our Figure Eight platform are not being sold into China or being used in China. So China has its own tech stack. And so that keeps the IP and the data completely separate.</p><p>We're also setting out China as pretty much a stand-alone entity for reasons of protection of IP and data but also to be able to respond to the local culture and the pace of business there. We've been very open and transparent with our customers about our activities in China, and they're very pleased with the way that we're structuring things. They maintain some interest in Chinese data. So they're pleased that we're there, but they're also doubly pleased that we're going to the trouble to structure things in such an air gapped fashion.</p><p>ADAM DELLAVERDE: Great. And I guess in terms of the customer base, the established customer base, which is showing amazing organic growth again, are you sensing any change in the way they are tendering, I guess in some way, your exclusive? Are you hanging on to that exclusivity to the best of your knowledge?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Again, I don't think we've ever said that we have exclusive relationships. But I will say that, and just echoing my earlier comment around demand, the most important thing for the customers is a reliable source -- a reliable supply of high-quality data at speed for a good price. And as long as we continue to deliver, our customers continue to be very happy.</p><p>Per the earlier question, I think, from Josh or maybe Paul, there was a question about competition. We don't see any change in the competitive landscape at the large scale. There are smaller start-ups on a regular basis providing annotation services but not to the level or the scale or the quality that our large customers -- that's why we're comfortable trying out.</p><p>ADAM DELLAVERDE: Right. Great. And I guess as you retain some capital and look to deploy it into acquisitions, if I sort of think about the acquisitions you've done so far, there's been an element of, I guess, productivity technology benefit to the core business and then something new on the other hand, maybe a new customer or maybe a new SaaS business. As you're looking forward, do you think it will be a similar story where you kind of justify part of it based on improvement to the core? Or is there some new capability or some new SaaS or new sector that you're looking at when you talk about that kind of opportunity?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. So we don't see -- I think we've got a pretty good set of technologies at the moment. So we don't see a technology acquisition in our space. At the moment, I think we're pretty solid there. We'd love to find the opportunity to add customers or add markets or add a related capability. But I don't think we'll be going for a purely tech play at this point. It's just my sense. We keep our eyes open for opportunities. But I think we've got a pretty good set of technologies at the moment.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question is from Stella Wang (sic) [Stella Wong], private investor.</p><p>STELLA S. WONG, VP AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FRANKLIN ADVISERS, INC.: Great choice of Wuxi as your processing center. Great location, close to Shanghai and Hangzhou and not as expensive. I got 2 questions. The first one is on R&amp;D, $13 million, I think the previously guided equivalent or comparable is about $12 million. So should we expect the $13 million to continue? Or is there any synergy you can strip out of that? Could you give us a bit of an updated guidance on that front?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. So I'm not sure of the $12 million number, Stella. But certainly, R&amp;D costs -- or R&amp;D is important for the business. And I think we'll see R&amp;D being a future of the business going forward. It's not going to jump up at the rate that it has as the table illustrates because we started from a pretty low base and also with the acquisition of the Figure Eight, that has added a lot of cost. But we will continue to invest in R&amp;D going forward. It's necessary for the future growth of the business.</p><p>STELLA S. WONG: Okay. Fair enough. And last question, in your Relevance segment, could you comment on how much of that work is done on data sourced by your customers from their end users? As you all know, there are losses by regulatory interrogation into transparency and privacy issues there. Just want to get some idea of whether that would impact the company in any shape or form in short or longer terms.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Yes. You're correct, data privacy is very important. And we always have and will continue to comply with the privacy regulations. And we work closely with our customers to ensure that they and us comply with the privacy regulations. From time to time, there are projects that need processes adjusted to comply. But we don't see a material difference in the work we're doing, the projects we're working on and the trajectory of the business. But it is something that we're super aware of.</p><p>STELLA S. WONG: Okay. So we shouldn't expect any material changes in that area for you?</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: We don't see it. No.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand back to Mr. Brayan for any closing remarks.</p><p>MARK RONALD GERARD BRAYAN: Thanks, Jenny, and thanks again to everybody for joining the call and for your interest in the company. And just to reinforce that we're very pleased to bring you these results. We're very positive about not only these results but the trajectory of the business. And looking forward to meeting many of you face to face over the coming roadshow. So thanks once again.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating.

Over to you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIYUSH GUPTA, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: So hello, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter session for the buy and sell side. We'll go straight into Q&amp;A. I'm going to ask those in the room. Does anybody? Yes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll just ask -- I just wanted to clarify or make sure that I get it right what you're saying on loan MAS charge.</p><p>So [the other split here is] Obviously, below the cycle average loan discharged, this looks very cheap.</p><p>And then as we go forward, you're obviously, talking about -- there's a possibility you'll get some recoveries. So you're saying over the next 2 or 3 years, you can also keep loan MAS charge below the -- through the cycle average.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually we've got 2 or 3 things happening here. One, we were very conservative in provisioning. And so we really built up some fairly strong buffers all around, including this quarter by the way. We took some large charges in our general provision just because of the environment. And so we did some management overlays to buffer up. So our provision has been actually been very conservative. The second thing is that our past provision was also conservative, particularly in the offshore marine sector. I think the situation, like you said, will be structured, they are performing okay. So I think over the next year or 2, there will be opportunities to take some recoveries there. But I think the important thing is that, I think, structurally we made some meaningful improvements in our risk management capability as well. So we feel a lot more confident today that we have our hands around our portfolio and our processes are a lot more robust than they were 5 years ago. So I think in a structured way as well, related to minor provisions it's actually better than it used to be. So there is some cushioning from the past, but I think, on a [going- concern] basis as well , I think, we have some upside.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Through the cycle it's 25 basis points?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: On SP's we've given 25, 27 basis points guidance in the past and yes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) and risk management changes are they more consumer linked or are they more SME, corporate?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Mostly corporate. If you look at the bulk of our credit issues over the last decade, they have been corporate issues. And what we've done is the last 2, 3 years it's hiked up a lot all around corporate credit management. We got much tighter in terms of our concentration -- object of concentration remains, we've got a lot more diversified, we have far more robust, early warning signals. We actually managed and balanced our portfolios. So for example in the first half of the year, we've sold down about $2 billion of loans. We know we should do that. So we now actually anticipate as we sold [$1 billion] in the second quarter alone. So we actually get ahead of the curve, we rebalanced the portfolio, we reduced our exposure to individual names. So it has a lot of different things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's what you did -- that sale because you were worried about these names or because these were hitting, let's say, x percent of your...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Hitting x percent. So not even...</p><p>But we started -- tightened up on how much exposure cap we want. And so we used different businesses so maybe we should participate or something or sell down something. So we're a lot more active in managing our portfolio than we used to be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just one more question. Just want to understand your NIM guidance a bit better. Asset yields were down, understood. You've paid back about SGD 3 billion of revenue to quarter, rate SGD 7 million on CP's ending the quarter. How much more can you do that then? Or if that setting the limits and the entire asset yield commission comes down. As in, if I want to just to break that up in next 3-, 6-months or further?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: We can do more. So our total CP borrowing is about SGD 16 billion, SGD 17 billion. We've checked, there is enough market appetite for us to -- there's another SGD 10 billion in the commercial paper market. So it's a question of trade off. How much more -- so the fixed deposit we've paid off were high-cost deposits which come from some segments of the market. So they did a payoff. Then you've got to then make the tradeoff between, if there is a core customer deposit, do you want to pay it off or not. So you calibrate that a little more carefully. But in terms of the immediate to issue commercial paper, [we have a lot of appetite] . We could do a lot more. In terms of the asset yield side of the thing, I think, if rates come off and obviously, pricing will come off a little bit. I do think that there's still that -- some part of the fixed rate loan book and mortgage that's going to be pricing. The tail end of the book so you'll get some lift from that. But you'll also start seeing some drops from SIBOR and HIBOR link zones [in these]. But unclear what happens to HIBOR. HIBOR, has been extraordinarily strong. And given the uncertainties in Hong Kong, it's not entirely clear to me whether HIBOR stays strong, doesn't stay strong. I'd say it's tough to call what happens to HIBOR more than anything else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sir, just a couple of housekeeping type questions again. So first of all on the loans, just looking at the year-to-date break down, obviously congrats you're doing much better than the system right now. But you've up growth here in others and you've got growth in professional and private individuals. Those together is about SGD 4 billion. Just want to know what's driving that? Those are not usual patterns that I look for that (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well, so -- maybe Sok Hui.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG, CFO, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: So you're looking at Page 18 -- 16, the performance summary. You have a question on the industry cuts and the others? That's your question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Others and also professional and private individuals in terms of year-to-date from June to December.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So June -- so year-to-date, yes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We have about SGD 5 odd billion for the book and SGD 2 billion in others, SGD 2 billion in professional and private, not the usual categories that I would look.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So the others are mainly sort of Singapore, step up on the sort of [one-off] category in the others and where we have actually seen growth. So that's a safe category. Professionals and private individuals have given more financing. Maybe you have heard about the global income bond we launched in the first quarter, so that's been quite attractive. And therefore, on the back of that, some additional financing for that product.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So basically, leverage on private bank [income]. So Wealth Management, private banking leverage loans go into that category. And [stack board and government-linked goals is with the other] category.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And so [on the mortgage], could you give some guidance on the SME. What are you seeing a pickup in? Because I'm assuming it's primary then secondary still pretty soft that we measure.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually, they say that it's soft. Refinance and building under construction has worked and retail picked up relative to first quarter. But still hasn't picked up as much. But do you see it has picked up with our launches and all the refinance actually picked up again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sir, and on NPLs, again just on slightly granular, I know there was some question on this earlier but [the movement] in Southeast Asia, the movement in --</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: The big NPLs are only in South and Southeast Asia, actually.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sir, just in --okay-- just in Indonesia in particular, there's also some obvious issues.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, no.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: No.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: In 1 case, It's a government company, single company. It's government-backed and we've got a strong network support from the government so don't expect it -- in the way, I took some provisions just because (inaudible) but we don't expect to go under. But it's a large government-linked company related to the NPL.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But how much [probability would you take] on that percentage?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Very small. About 20%</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: 20%.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's it?</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: This poll for quarter end left us confident in this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, but then neighboring countries over there are all comfortably expanded in trade before.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: It is not like a guarantee, this level of comfort. And this is -- still I'm assuming. So it has -- but under IFRS 9, when it wasn't all that's required, it's actually nothing. In fact, it's the nature of collateral and the nature of support. So how much you rely on the government. The total exposure to the system in Indonesia is SGD 2.5 billion. They are like SGD 50 million.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's why I'm -- I was assuming maybe you'd take.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: The rest of the system hasn't been doing much in NPL, and they haven't marked any provision on it, 0. So from our standpoint, given the strong government support, the fact it's actively being restructured right now and we restructure an acceptable promotional terms from what we can see. We probably don't have to take provisions on it so we might as well take something just in case. I won't expect it to go on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you talk about your stress tests that you talked about earlier? I mean actively Hong Kong and China looks risky, but you said you're quite clear on your stress test there's no issues.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well, we've been -- this time we've been very proactive about addressing weaknesses. So we've been doing this obviously now for 6 to 8 months. So we tested the entire tech supply chain. There are some 400, 500 companies altogether who form part of the tech supply chain in the whole system. And so we tested what happens if tariffs go up to whatever 25%, 50%. We tested what happens the revenue (inaudible) and so 7. We tested the whole scheme and then we took off from that, which companies are likely to continue to exhibit more stress on stream when the situation happens. And then we proactively look at ring fencing exposure, working down exposure, et cetera, for those kinds of companies. So I'd say we've been quite active about rebalancing our portfolio for the last 3 quarters. That's partly a reflection of all the stress testing and portfolio actions that our portfolio deals that we've done.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) in there then we have option in that (inaudible). Is it just the warranty from using the index (inaudible) in Indonesia (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: We also had a problem in the last 2 years for which we have put into then [300 and 400]. At this point in time, I don't think we have anything else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You mentioned that you're committing exposure in terms of your underwriting [you have] on the corporate side. Will that translate to RWA, kind of lower RWAs and kind of how soon that...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually, it has. If you look at our ES, ECL of the thing, including last quarter, this quarter as well, what's happening is that our overall RWAs and the CCL improved because we are reducing our exposure into weaker names and the order of quality of our book is improving. And so then we are actually putting orderly management positions to top it up right, because of weakness.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Can I ask you to speak up? Because they're recording this for the transcript.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So just to clarify, under the new IFRS 9 you start building up provisions before they go bad. So when loans do become bad and you see sort of a flow-through, through NPL, you actually release your GP because you have set some of these effects for specific means that have not gone bad previously. So on our provisioning methodology we have restructured. So that's one reason why GP will go down. The other reason, which we explained the last quarter, is we're actually managing up some of these names, which have not reached NPL, just if you think they are sort of weak, so we manage that up. So if you see the SGD 58 million charge for this quarter, you would have to understand that we have taken much more in terms of buffering. Because otherwise with all these sort of write-backs in GPs, it actually offsets it together with a SGD 58 million charge. So the general provision allows us that we have set aside for this economic uncertainty is actually quite large.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm asking, just in terms of guidance, I guess stuff has really come off in some of your corporate loan book price itself. But is that one bit that you're talking -- think you perhaps that affecting moves in terms of the mortgage for, I mean for advance that is competitive in the end, that has kind of pick up in terms of your linear pricing for the back book and front book. What is the difference in price and how fast can you see it help you in terms of (inaudible).</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: In terms of the front book, we compete tactically. So we don't drop prices with it. We are the only game in town. So we don't specifically take a reduction in prices, so we compete tactically in some segments of the market. But we try to hold pricing up. So so far, we've been able to hold market shares. Means that you know the front book, so which means that we've been able to actually compete effectively without dropping a lot of pricing. Our overall portfolio NIM, (inaudible) are holding up. They've been going up and they're working up. What happens going forward is hard to say. If people start dropping pricing dramatically then of course we have to compete notebook value. So my forecast is based on our best-case guess for what the market exactly do for the next couple of quarters.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have a question, follow up question on the ECL mentioned earlier. So far we have not seen a decline in the [NPL] and so far we have only seen increases in that. Please help us just understand how that works, like what drives the decline in our LDR. Secondly, on your risk management. Is this also IFRS 9-driven? So your better risk management is then being driven by the IFRS 9 framework in itself or is it something that DBS has done specifically, just for that (inaudible) industry on the back of this? And then you put this offset by a weaker than expected environment, growth continues to be slow and maybe this recovery that you're expecting might not come through for the next year or after?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Do you want to talk about it?</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So the MAS methodology that ensures that every bank keeps at least 1% based on the methodology. And any difference is actually taken through the result. So at this point in time, we are at the about 0.85% compared to the old methodology. Our total side of ECL. So that's actually very high relative to actually more banks that you see. So like you said, indication of seeing coverage. And as a proportion of NPL as seen at GP, we're 100%, right? So that's -- and in terms of the risk management, our IFRS 9 methodology is built upon the credit process.</p><p>So our credit process actually requires our officers to sort of flag up early where they see those weaknesses, either in the sector or in specific means. So as they move from sort of performing to amber, to red, to (inaudible) before they reach NPL, the IFRS 9 expected credit loss, that's up substantially. And to the extent that they are managing the same names and release, the sort of ECL then drops. So that's how the process works. So they are linked, yes, and -- to our credit process.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: But the other way around. So actually, it means sort of -- because they added so much GP this quarter. So 1% minus the GP the smaller number, is how it really comes down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So you can offset that? Because if your ECL is lower than 1% then you have to drop it, but if it's more than 1%...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So if the -- if my ECL was all 1%, my other level would be 0. The both responses would be 0. They commented that they don't like to keep RLAR. The only requirement we have to put RLAR there is if you're under 1%. If you're 1% and over there's no RLAR. So it's a net number, so depending on what you put in goes into RLAR. If you bump up this number (inaudible) number comes up. And on the other thing, we actually have (inaudible). We have improved the whole risk management processes. IFRS 9, our experiment is not dependent on IFRS 9 or IFRS 9 outcome comes from IFRS 9.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: A couple more questions. The Wealth Management income this quarter is also super strong. It's at like almost the same level as Q1 and Q2, which I didn't feel like that quarter. Generally will be that quarter and you have a lot of volatility. So was there any run-off this quarter or (inaudible).</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Actually, it is actually quite strong. And it's also a variety of different products. So as far as units, that's went up a lot so the people bought funds [and they made us] quite actively. People did a lot of currency links up. People did more insurance. It was very broad-based.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Would you expect this to kind of...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So far in July, we very (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Third question, please, on digital banking. I think one of the key advantages in the virtual banks have is that they don't have branches, right. So they have lower CI. Do you think this will also make you rethink your brand strategy or your steady state cost to income ratio target like over time? If you don't -- if you realize that you don't need as many branches, you can probably bring your cost to income even lower than it is today...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, sir. Of course we can. We start a bank from ground zero, you can start a bank much more cheaply, do you have to pay for cost of customer acquisition? So one thing you got to figure that all of the people are saying that they don't need branches, yes, but the amount of money that's spent acquiring customers is a lot more than the cost of a branch reconstruction, for all of these guys. There are only money left, right, in terms of them trying to get all the customers. So you can add customer acquisition costs into the CI and they think it will be low-cost R&amp;D. All of these guys lose money. And if they lose money they spend more than 100% of the revenue they're trying to find.</p><p>But yes, particularly because we are not -- we are also conscious of the nature of the bank that we are. We are a public bank business in Singapore. And therefore, there's a limit to how sharply we want to come back on brand footprint. I think that's all we have to pay. And we do that consciously. So what we've done and we got good at is maximize the efficiency of our branch network. So we don't actually cut in the number of branches. Though we've cut down few branches. But mostly, which it is a footprint in the branches, there are -- and we do branches half the size of the old branches. We'll give you the head count in the branches. So branch head count is now already down by about half. So we continue to drive efficiency from the cost to the branch structure, not necessarily reduce the number of branches.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just following up on that. Piyush, obviously you have a lot ahead and done of the whole digital journey and agenda. But do you think that the newest company stake could possibly generate new revenue streams likewise, with strong sales backing them, like alternative things coming into play and chipping away at your current market share?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: It's possible. So far, I've not seen any evidence of a new revenue stream from any digital bank anywhere in the world. Neither the U.K. bank, there's nothing in the U.S. nor any other banks. The only person who got a consistent strong revenue stream is Ali. And they have -- it's not a new revenue stream. They have gone and tapped into a lending market. And one day the market will have people there, so -- versus China.</p><p>The size of that market of small countries are de minimis. And then on top of that, in China, they are unregulated they can lend what they want. In Singapore, MAS doesn't let you lend more than 4x, so what do you do? It's a great tiny market that you can lend into.</p><p>So you can't lose up. It is go for these segments. Micro -- like I said, moneylenders, micro SMEs, which are very few indeed, you can argue there might be some opportunity there. It's not entirely scarce to be in, as I'm looking and it's been 5 years, I'm still looking around the world to look for some really good use case. Some of you have been able to track in front, but the way I see the private banking is money raises where there is money. You move money around and you lend money. That's all every banking revenue stream that you look at fundamentally comes from this raising money, moving money up and charge the fees along the way, right?</p><p>So if you take it to fundamentals what is banking about? So you've got to try and raise money from segment or raise it for GP. Can I lend it to segments or lend it more intelligently or better? And can I make money by being more efficient in the way I move money around and raise capital (inaudible)? And when we started to look at that prism, it's not obvious to me where are the big opportunities to create with the [use] and [countries].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And a thing on the Indian banks kind of catching up on the radar in terms of the whole tech movement and transformation, like could you share some thoughts around that as well? Like you were obviously a little ahead in the game, but it seems like kind of getting there.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well part of them. I think around the world in the last couple of years, almost every bank has woken up to the sight that we took, so were [2 or a year] and ahead of other banks. As much as, you can see JPMorgan, Jamie just said they're spending $11 billion a year. If you see the Bank of America, you can see a whole slew of banks, including the Indian banks. So a lot of banks are investing money to catch up. I think the 2 or 3 challenges -- in fact, everybody will -- have to progress on those at those in fact.</p><p>But there are 2 or 3 things which are not that easy to do. One is changing of your whole tech stack. In my (inaudible) 10 years to be able to change the tech stack. It's not that easy to replace the core banking to move to micro system, to move to the big tech like small. Small is big. And even the most of the Indian banks I looked at, they're still not even building, testing the architect in the whole tech stack, so I think it'll take time.</p><p>The other thing that is changing the way we work, so to be able to drive more culture so you can actually complete with the big tech companies is also not ready. So I think there is assertive progress in the industry overall, including with the Indian banks. I think for all of us, including us when you compare us with the -- out of Amazon, Alibaba offerings. We still have a long way to go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just wondering on your noncorporate -- sorry, the corporate loan book, I think recently there have been some green financing and then the real estate here say they are about 20 to 50 basis points lower. So is there a sort of margin profitability tradeoff where you get somebody based on the risk-weighted assets [waiting along].</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: There is another -- a tradeoff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. So there's no tradeoff.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, there is a tradeoff. We're giving it up. So we're giving it up to drive this thing so we don't dwell on cost of funding. Right now, it doesn't go on cost of capital. And RWA calculations don't change based on green or sustainable. And therefore, when EBITDA average ends greatly, I tell people to understand some things bearing the cost in data and unfortunately, it's a couple of billion dollars in (inaudible) the recited business you find cheaper. I'm happy to do that to promote the agenda, but so far, it's a tradeoff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay, and seems you're seeing that net cycle, your overall risk management culture is very cautious and hardly come down. Just getting what in their conversation differ on these, but do you think that there is a room that is in all this capital countercyclical buffers and all are lower, and therefore, there can be some room on the capital side?</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: I think you got all the rules, so I don't think MAS has discussion to amend these countercyclical buffers in terms of regulation. And you don't have a Singapore tax of capital requirement. It's already above [ARPU now]. So that will stay. But I think our ratio as it is now, I think that's like comfortable with the sort of ratio guided to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And just a housekeeping thing, so you're in the margin. Your margins I think year-on-year is up -- for the second quarter is up 6 bps, right, 1.85%, 1.91%. Your Hong Kong margins are up over 22 bps, right? Singapore should be up because SIBOR has gone up. So where exactly -- which part of the book the overall market has...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Dollar book and the other currencies were down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: U.S. dollar...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: We got about 2 basis points in Singapore; we got about 1 basis point in Hong Kong, we had a drag from the dollar -- U.S. dollar book and other local currencies. But we also had some technical stuff so that washed out a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, I'm going to ask the operator to check with those that dialed in if they have any questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have Conrad Werner from Macquarie.</p><p>CONRAD WERNER, HEAD OF ASEAN EQUITY RESEARCH, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: I just want to add a quick follow-up on the outlook for the mortgage book. I think there was one comment in the media session talking about a net flat outcome for that for the full year. But then I think later, there was also mention of adding growth of SGD 2 billion to the book year-over-year. Could you just maybe repeat the official guidance on the mortgage outlook through the end of the year, please?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: 2 billion was effectively the delta from first half to second half. The first half was minus 1. We did the second half. It will be plus 1. So the full year will be close to 0. Between 0 and half of it.</p><p>OPERATOR: There are no questions at the moment. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, [Robert.]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just think about extreme situations, what are your critical levels on capital, return on risk-weighted assets, whatever are the metrics you've used before at SGD 0.30 dividend before it gets revised or reviewed? And maybe some critical numbers if you would have to really look at that.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So our operating range, we guided to about 12.5% to 13.5%. So now with quarterly dividends, so it's more stable. You remove all the noise. But I think you should expect us to upgrade sort of somewhere in that range. And our guidance continues to be that -- it will sort of increase our dividend in line with a stable outlook. So that continues to be our dividend policy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Is that sort of ROI or similar KPI that you -- if you fell below a certain level, you rethink this?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Right now, I'm biased to existing fees if not reduce it. So you and I, we see different parts of the universe, Robert. No, I mean clearly if you go back to (inaudible) recovery plan. So the recovery plan essentially says that if we breakthrough our capital targets, and if it's at 11.5% or 12% capital adequacy, then we might go back and rethink our dividend.</p><p>Actually, what's the exact number is? Does somebody know what the company spend...</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: No, we do intend to operate at level. But I mean anytime we go below 12.5%. I think the guidance range is 12.5% to 13.5%. So as we go slightly over to sort of 12.5%, but I think...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, but a lot of these things. If it slightly turns high before we go to dividend, there's a lot about the tools in our toolkit, and we can sort of manage our RWAs. We can do a bunch of -- get the less efficient asset. There's a lot of things we can do before we start to attack the dividend. One of the reasons we've been cautious about the dividend policy is I don't envisage the -- ever having to cut it, so we've been very comfortable about how we increase it, so we don't have to go down and cut it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) talk about (inaudible) Vietnam and another market and what is the outlook there and when you intend to go in?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: We don't have specific plans right now. It's something we're looking at. And it is only for the management bandwidth. We feel positive on Vietnam. But between now, there's more investment moving from China to Vietnam. But also underlying growth is good. So we're positive. Question is pacing out there. So how do you...?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) chart digital bank...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, we already have a branch there. So -- and the business is doing well. Our business in the last year has done very well. It's all a corporate business. We don't have a SME retail business. So the idea would be to use the digital -- exactly as we've done in other countries. We use digital to expand into an SME and retail space if we wanted to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just (inaudible) question please. (inaudible) offsetting 0.6% so you're above the top of your rank based upon I think it's projections -- dividend projections et cetera, et cetera. Your dividend looks self-sustained. So I can't imagine why we didn't come down to the top end of the range. So even if we've got a period of economic uncertainty, is your view that you are quite happy to continue to operate just a little bit at the top end of that range. So if you sit there, let's say in 2 quarters of time, and we're at 30, to 8 or 14, would you say we'll actually have to recalibrate it then or are you quite happy (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well, we didn't have a reason to hold or stay in that range.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So you would have to bring it down to give it a balance?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So the reason we've given guidance to our top end of the range. We want to be a safe bank. But at the same time, we got to calibrate between being safe and returning what we can to shareholders, right? And so we calibrated the range so that, if you're well over the range, you don't get to (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. So we should take that range today...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: And so our dividend policy, we will continue to grow our dividend in a sustainable way over time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So we should believe in that range.</p><p>Even that you booked in Hong Kong but the (inaudible) range in network. Does it impact your profitability at all?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: When people comment...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) taxes.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: The Hong Kong/Singapore taxes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: What is the shift of AUM? What do you exactly mean by that when people worry about Hong Kong? You said that...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, no, no. If it were, I don't think it happens. If it were, the shift depends -- the macro shift will now change but who the beneficiary of the shift. So if you're operating in Hong Kong, we have strong market share, right? So you have big banks and large -- and look at all of the [Swiss] banks, they're much bigger than us in Hong Kong. But if money were to shift to Singapore, we have double the market share. So most people have more money to Singapore, they look at DBS twice as seriously as they look at us in other parts of the world.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But your product suite and ambition would be things that doesn't matter (inaudible).</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: It is more psychological, that kind of thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You talk about a very interesting bit on customer acquisition in the fintech. In India, you had to look for a long time. We're going for the technical partnership. How is your customer acquisition cost shifting in India? And (inaudible) utilization, but is it getting to a point we are feeling it is cheaper to apply a customer even after we have some cost on branching around that level. What you do for your delivery?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, no. So they're only branching enough to be able to create brand presence. And together on the regulatory change that I need to have some physical presence since I want to market in a particular area. And sir, is this the (inaudible) I want to market in digitally and corporeally to have some presence in Bhopal. So if a customer signs up from Bhopal, I still have to go to override as I don't have a branch in Bhopal, we can't make a change in customer regulation, which is a strange regulation but it is what it is. So it allows me to address that. And second is you need some brand relevance if we got the digital thing going in Indonesia works better if people see the DBS chain somewhere in the city, they would know that we exist. So we have very limited plan on the consumer side. The other thing, we're trying the digital for SME. SME you do need some points of presence to (inaudible) documentation, et cetera. That's what we're (inaudible) in India. The customer acquisition cost (inaudible) our customer acquisition costs has come down from the digital cost. SGD 66 is now down to about SGD 10 made per customer. So it come down very dramatically over time. But you've got to understand what is the quality of the customer? So a big learning for us in the first 2 years is we were getting a lot of customers. But when you look at them how the customer never going to be profitable. So we don't have to repeat -- pivot it and sharpen up the learning from Indonesia, so we scaled down the amount of customers from what we get. But we're now getting much better customer profile. That's what got us to close to our new hurdles that (inaudible). But then you have cost per customer acquisition is higher because my fixed cost is spread over a smaller number of customers, so the customer cost per acquisition goes down, but a newer customer goes up. But you will trade off the quality of the customer as well when you track acquisition cost.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You should count ambition loan mix in India make 2, 3 years down the line (inaudible).</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: It's way early. The 2, 3 years is not enough to move the needle. So we today, we're booking now on secured loan of about SGD 8 million to SGD 10 million a month from India and Indonesia, right? And that's growing. It's doubled from here to here. But you have SGD 120 million. Double that, it'll be SGD 200 million, SGD 300 million. I can't get worth SGD 300 million. So it's a small percentage in the big scheme of things now. But the good thing with this is it's growing exponentially. So we projected -- SME -- SME is just started. So SME we just started. It is very early. So we only got 2, 3 months of SME experience on that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can I ask one -- on the GE increase this quarter, could you help us understand which part of the ECL (inaudible) how can you provide more JV? (inaudible) did something else change? Because the last time (inaudible) rights of (inaudible) How does that happen? How does that work exactly?</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So typically, you would see -- in last quarter, we had SGD 100 million write-back right? So we said that you actually get ECL moving into -- when you have NPL moving as ECL, right? Then you have a weak case, for example, that goes out of the system into a reduction. The last year, these 2 elements were there in the first quarter.</p><p>On top of that, remember fourth quarter, the markets were looking really bad. So first quarter, based on our methodology, actually we released -- in some sense, driven also go by the equity market. So we actually released some contract to the very bad environment in the fourth quarter where everybody was expecting the worse with the rate hikes and all that. So there was a SGD 100 million write-back in the first quarter.</p><p>In the second quarter, you have the same 2 elements. Again, we released our ECL because NPL -- some have moved NPL, and you further managed down some of the weak names in the ECL stage. So having moved this to the change in the second quarter is the full weight, right? So this is second quarter everything sort of looked much more strong from a macro perspective, from a geopolitical perspective. So it would be up element in the second quarter. (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: (inaudible) most of us are model-driven. But we retain the flexibility to put some over (inaudible). So the -- we don't -- if you (inaudible) somehow, the macroeconomic behavior and the model are not capturing everything, then we actually add something about that.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So it's not different from what most bank would describe in the management overlay. So for example, the UK banks have all put in management overlay for Brexit because of the uncertain outlook. So that is how you manage an ECL (inaudible). You need to split (inaudible) justify the document.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: And the auditors has got to sign off on it. So what is the underlying and why you need to do it. So you look at the (inaudible) numbers, it's got a big over lift from Brexit. So nobody knows what it might be, but it is just to put something there to be (inaudible). So we just took note of the good macroeconomic headwinds from trade and taken up our (inaudible) and adjust it for this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Do you have any intentions of disclosing more details around the ECL framework (inaudible) banks are doing (inaudible).</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: So we will sort of -- I think at year-end, there's normally ECL profit last year. So last year when we publish our ECL, actually ours was the most comprehensive in this part of the world. So this year, we'll see what advantage additional disclosures will be helpful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: One more question on NIM. So previously, you mentioned that one great cut you are expecting NIM to impact it by strong bps and additional cuts perhaps 1 to 2 bps. And you also mentioned that you had the room to take in more strategy for funding up to about 10 billion. So does that 1 and 1, 2 bps reduction in NIM taken into account the potential funding using cheaper CPs versus say at least?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: No, so I estimated the current book. Of course the management base keeps seeing what we need to do with the book, including hereon high (inaudible) funding cost. There's more of that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm thinking of last quarter's LDR it seems to be one of the highest in the last few quarters. But NSFR, LDR looks pretty stable, which means there is probably more room for you to get LDR (inaudible). Can that move us significantly more because given your dilemma buffer on LDR.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Of course. But I'm also conscious of the fact that I don't want to wind up being more way aggressive on liquidity. There's no idea what's going to happen if things suddenly go (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just on the cost side. You said there's a bit of flexibility on the cost. But if I'm looking in the longer term, is this of a level that you let cost to income go to -- if we see more pressure on revenue than you expect.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, I don't have given it too much thought, but it affecting that for a period of time, a year or so our cost/income ratio has to go up, then we will dip it. It's not something we want, but I'm quite serious. We don't manage to say okay let's scale down for quarterly performance, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So are you seeing more pressure in mix shift in deposits towards savings going down everywhere? I know you think we held there. I think in other markets, it's been quite a clear shift.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Anyway, still in Singapore. So we had market share. But the system there's a clear shift from savings to fixed deposits and (inaudible). I think it really come off. You'll see that hardly works. I went and modeled it, the last 2 (inaudible) increase cycles for the last 25 years. It always happens. And the rate increase cycle is starting a shift from savings to deposits. And then the rate increase cycle changes starting the shift to where it was. So of course we could -- the behavior could be different than (inaudible) granted. But so it's been going up. But the pressures already moderated. So I think it's not actually (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: All right. So we'll see you next quarter. Thanks for coming.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: All right. Thanks, everybody.</p><p>SOK HUI CHNG: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. We will now disconnect.

On behalf of everyone at the Standard Bank Group, thank you for joining us for our first fully online results presentation. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Before starting the presentation itself, I'd like to take a moment to honor the memory of those Standard bankers who have lost their lives in the pandemic. There's been a handful. Our thoughts are with them and with their loved ones. I'd also like to express our profound gratitude to the health professionals and to other essential workers, including thousands of Standard Bank staff. Thank you for your courage, your determination, your stamina and your empathy.</p><p>The results we are presenting this morning reflect the economic damage caused by the pandemic, but they also reflect the strength of the Standard Bank Group. They demonstrate our capacity to support our clients and our communities, and to make considerable strategic progress during the most difficult 6 months in living memory.</p><p>This half, 62% of our banking headline earnings were generated by our Africa Regions businesses. This illustrates the strength of our Africa-wide portfolio. And of course, also sums up the extent of the damage to the South African economy. Our Corporate &amp; Investment Banking business was another major source of strength this half, and in particular, our Global Markets business, which responded with great accuracy to challenging and volatile market conditions.</p><p>The first 6 months of this year saw unprecedented declines in economic activity and asset prices throughout the world. We've seen fiscal, monetary, public health, technological and social responses that were equally unprecedented in their pace and scale. The economic effects in South Africa have been particularly negative with the economy expected to have its worst year in a century and with a mounting risk of a sovereign debt crisis.</p><p>We have structured our response to the pandemic into 3 overlapping phases: respond, recover and reimagine. I will say more about respond just now, and then address recover and reimagine at the end of the presentation.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold in March and April, our immediate priorities were to support our clients and to do everything we could to keep our staff safe and well. In our view, these priorities were clearly also in the immediate and longer-run interest of our shareholders. The group's essential services have functioned without material disruption throughout the period. We are confident that they will continue to do so as we make the transition back to more normal operations.</p><p>Over the first 6 months of this year, we have provided client relief worth ZAR 118 billion to personal and SME clients, we've assisted corporate clients at ZAR 48 billion of exposure and, with Liberty, paid out ZAR 6.4 billion in short-term and insurance claims.</p><p>Thanks to extremely hard and rapid work by our facilities and IT teams, we have enabled more than 80% of our colleagues to work from home. We have done everything we can to make our offices and branches safe for our colleagues and for our clients. For example, by implementing university -- universal daily symptom checks and by providing gloves, masks, distance markers and perspex screens.</p><p>It has become clich\u00e9 that modern financial firms are IT companies. In our case, total IT function spend amounted to nearly 1/3 of our total operating expenses over the half. This is appropriate. Nearly all of our clients want nearly all of our services delivered online. They expect our services should be at least as reliable as those provided to them by global big tech firms.</p><p>In order to achieve this, we first needed to replace our legacy systems with a modern core banking system. That's now been completed. Having done that, we then needed to construct and maintain an efficient and flexible front end that can deliver our services and solutions securely, 24/7 and in a user-friendly way to our clients.</p><p>Our IT investments resemble any other investment portfolio. There's no real return without risk and some investments just will not pay off. Notably, we have found that aspects of our work performance to improve these client engagement system were no longer suitable, and it was, therefore, necessary to recognize a large impairment of the previously capitalized asset.</p><p>We remain certain that it's far better to innovate than to pursue the false security of trying to take no risk. In our increasingly digital industry, that would simply guarantee obsolescence. With this commitment to ongoing innovation in mind, we are now in the fourth phase of our IT journey, and it is with this in mind that we are aiming to provide increasingly personalized and comprehensive solutions for our clients on our digital platform. I'll provide some specific examples in a few minutes and say more about our medium-term vision before we conclude.</p><p>Despite the most challenging economic conditions in a century, the group's pre-provision operating income was up 4%. A dramatic decline in group headline earnings, therefore, is very largely driven by the 166% increase in credit impairment charges over the period. This reflects the extraordinary strain on households and firms imposed by the pandemic in South Africa, in particular.</p><p>Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong and well above regulatory minimum. At 8.5%, our return on equity reflects the once in a century economic conditions experienced over the half and our cautious management of credit risk in light of the large uncertainties we continue to face.</p><p>Now turning to our value drivers, the first one of which is client focus. In addition to the client relief measures mentioned earlier, we have also waived fees, reduced premiums and paid out premium cash-backs, for instance, to clients who have been driving less as a result of the lockdowns.</p><p>We have played an active role in the industry in all the initiatives and also in the public partnerships that were calculated to mitigate the economic damage caused by the pandemic. It's important to emphasize that we have continued to develop and launch new solutions over the half.</p><p>Here are some examples of how we're expanding the digital solutions available to our clients. Entrepreneurship is a major driver of economic growth, particularly when small businesses develop the potential to expand and contribute to job creation. To enable small businesses to grow, we have created a suite of successful digital solutions that support the growth of Africa's SMEs.</p><p>For example, we launched SimplyBlu towards the end of 2019 to enable small enterprises in South Africa to move their businesses online. Our BizFlex SME lending solution has been taken up by almost 4,000 SMES since launching mid-2019, with ZAR 600 million in loans dispersed. The OneFarm platform in Uganda is now used by more than 500 farmers and has been proven to significantly increase their crop yield.</p><p>Among several other solutions, I would also draw your attention to, firstly, TradeClub, which connect our clients to more than 20,000 businesses across 60 countries, drawing on our digital trade alliance with 14 leading international banks. And secondly, QuantumTrade, which is the first proposition out of our award-winning Quantum Leap program for corporate customers. This has reduced the processing time for guarantees and letters of credit from days to an average of just 25 minutes.</p><p>We have continued to focus on ensuring that our client can conveniently and seamlessly meet the needs on our digital platforms. We have added a new feature -- well, several new features and services for our mobile banking app 6x so far this year, such as the ability to register tax free investments accounts and improved functionality for our reward program.</p><p>Our My360 wealth management app has been developed and downloaded by 27,000 clients. Clients continued to enjoy our contactless, virtual and cashless offerings during this time. More than 100,000 new virtual cards were loaded to enable clients to safely shop online, while businesses made 15% more InstantMoney bulk payments in this half as they increasingly adopt this cashless option to pay employees without bank accounts.</p><p>Our LookSee platform has been used by almost 340,000 unique visitors in the last 6 months, an increase of 25% compared to the prior period. And we have 13x as many subscribers to Standard Bank Mobile as a year ago, with clients enjoying the convenience, affordability and flexibility of this offering. And of course, we have not stopped innovating. For example, in July, we successfully processed our first client-originated cross-border transaction end-to-end using blockchain.</p><p>Moving on to employee engagement. In June, we surveyed all staff, asking them how they were doing and how they were feeling. We had a good response rate, and we're very pleased with the results. 95% of staff reported that they have adapted well to working from home or to social distancing conditions in their branches or their offices. 89% of Standard Bankers felt proud of what we have done to support our clients and colleagues during the pandemic, I'm part of that large majority.</p><p>Just as we have not allowed the pandemic to stop us from innovating in the service of our clients, we have not stopped equipping ourselves with the skills that we need for the digital age. Quite the reverse, our colleagues have accessed almost 400,000 learning items from our online learning platform since April.</p><p>Turning now to risk and conduct. While we manage a broad range of financial and nonfinancial risks on an ongoing basis, we are focused particularly on portfolio and ESG risks over this half. Looking at the group's portfolio as a whole, 3 points are worth emphasizing.</p><p>First, our book is very well diversified by business line and geography. Second, despite considerable strain on our clients, we remain within risk appetite. We have more than enough capital to support our lending comfortably and to continue to expand lending when appropriate. Third, we are and will remain in a state of heightened vigilance, being very close to our clients as the pandemic and its aftermath unfold.</p><p>The Standard Bank Group is firmly committed to doing everything we can to mitigate climate change and to promote a just transition away from carbon-intensive development. We will publish our first TCFD-aligned disclosures and our fossil fuel financing policy before the end of the year. When considering whether or not to support any particular project, we will continue to consider its economic, social and environmental impact in a balanced and holistic way.</p><p>Finally, on this point, we do not see these issues as inevitably characterized by stark dichotomies. We think it is usually possible to find solutions that promote both human development and environmental sustainability, whilst also making a good return for our shareholders. Our sustainable finance team is having a lot of success doing just that.</p><p>I will now hand you over to Arno.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE, GROUP FINANCIAL DIRECTOR &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Thank you, Sim, and good morning to everyone. I'm now going to take you through the financial outcome for the group. For the 6 months ended 30th June, 2020, starting on Slide 17. This slide, which most of you will be accustomed to, illustrates how we think about growth, resilience and returns to drive shareholder value.</p><p>In a crisis period like we are going through, management's immediate attention and focus has been on ensuring resilience, and this score we have fared well with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at a healthy 12.6%, the ratios of our both the regulatory minimum and our internal targets, providing a large cushion in these difficult times. It also allows us to continue to support our clients in their time of need.</p><p>And as you can see from our asset growth on to left-hand side of this slide, in this tough environment, interest rate margins and fees came under pressure, offsetting an excellent trading result. The overwhelming impact on the set of results has been a significant increase in the charge for credit impairments, which I will discuss in detail on later slides. Banking activities headline earnings consequently dropped 40%. And as Sim mentioned, group headline earnings dropped 44%. In line with the South African Reserve Bank's guidance, the Standard Bank Group Board has not declared an interim dividend.</p><p>Slide 18 provides a snapshot of interest rate movements in our key markets over the last 18 months. Widespread interest rate cuts we experienced in almost all the markets in which we operate. In South Africa, the SARB had started cutting rates in the second half 2019, and accelerated by the crisis, cut a further 275 basis points in the period.</p><p>This slide shows currency movements relative to the rand over the same 18-month period. Rand weakness was a feature of a result this period. South Africa, Angola and Zambian sovereign downgrades were all evident in their currency's weakness in the period.</p><p>Turning to Slide 20. Client activity is a dominant driver for revenue, and the impact of various stages of lockdowns and curfews across our operations had a significantly negative impact. We have provided more detailed analysis in the business line discussions later. But it is clear from this summarized analysis that across the board, transactional banking activity was stalled during lockdowns.</p><p>As can be expected, digital activity levels held up well and further displaced branch-based activity. Our wealth businesses proved resilient with AUM, assets under management in other words, and deposits increasing. Trading activity and volumes increased as corporate clients hedged and rebalanced their portfolios. Our equities franchise showed excellent growth to increase market share in values traded on the JSE by over 100%, showing the importance of contribution of our flow and electronic trading capabilities.</p><p>This slide provides a summarized group income statement. Net interest income was supported by strong balance sheet growth, albeit at shrinking margins, resulting in a flat outcome on the prior period. Robust trading revenues helped noninterest revenue grow by 6%. Costs were well contained at a growth of 1.8%. Positive jaws of 100 basis points or a pre-provision operating profit, which pleasingly grew 4% period-on-period to ZAR 24.3 billion.</p><p>Credit impairment charges of ZAR 11.3 billion were 2.7x higher than the prior period, reflective of the very difficult environment and resulted in a credit loss ratio of 169 basis points. Consequently, banking operations reported headline earnings of ZAR 7.7 billion at 40% from the prior period. After accounting for our business in ICBCS and Liberty, group headline earnings were ZAR 7.5 billion, which is a decrease of 44% on the first half of 2019, and resulted in group return on equity of 8.5%.</p><p>Turning to Slide 22, in this period, there were some large items which resulted in a sizable difference between the group's headline earnings and profit attributable to ordinary shareholders. As you know, headline earnings is a JSE-mandated measure of operating earnings and excludes items of a capital nature. Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated including these capital and nontrading items such as in this reporting period, impairments on intangible assets and the net gain on the exit of our investment in Argentina. After taking these into account, attributable profit was 71% lower than the prior period.</p><p>The bulk of the intangible asset impairment in the period relates to a system known as New Business Online. Our corporate and business clients perform their daily banking on our platform Business Online. An updated version of the software was rolled out to clients in Africa Regions over the past few years, with South African clients due to be upgraded this year. We recently made the decision not to migrate South African clients onto the upgraded platform. As we believe our clients will be better served by the deployment of our more modern platform. Components of the build for South African clients were asset sales that's impaired and a ZAR 2.1 billion impairment on a pretax basis was consequently recognized.</p><p>This slide, Slide 23, sets out strong balance sheet growth, which supported NII. Average loan growth for the period in CIB was 19%, mainly driven by corporates accessing liquidity. In PBB, growth was slower at 7%, with strong growth in digital disbursements, unsecured loans, offset by slower growth in traditional secured lending impacted by lockdowns. Restructures of loan books during the period were significant, as Sim pointed out, and installment holidays and a slowdown in prepayments contributed to book growth. Deposit growth has been strong across the banking sector as clients held on to liquidity in an uncertain environment.</p><p>Turning to net interest income on Slide 24. Net interest income was flat as balance sheet growth was offset by margin compression. Margins declined by 57 basis points to 387 basis points, as you can see on the slide. The biggest driver of the decline was the change and reduction in interest rates. On a weighted basis, average interest rates declined over 150 basis points across our portfolio period-on-period. This led to negative endowment on capital and funding of 25 basis points.</p><p>Pricing pressure contributed a further 18 basis points to the decline as certain assets repriced faster than deposits and CIB and VAF experienced competitive pricing pressures. In addition, as you can see on the slide, there was a negative mix impact of 12 basis points. CIB loans and deposits grew faster than PBB and additional liquidity resulted in higher cash balances.</p><p>Moving to Slide 25, which details noninterest revenue. Within noninterest revenue, fee and commission income declined as consumer activity levels and transactional volumes decreased significantly as a result of the lockdowns. Higher digital transaction volumes were offset by lower business in electronic funds transfer fees. Fee and commission revenue was supported, however, by growth in assets under management, most notably in Nigeria. Trading income grew 40% to ZAR 8.1 billion. Client transaction flows and associated trading revenues increased significantly, as clients navigated a complex and a volatile environment. ForEx trading was the main contributor to this result across all markets.</p><p>I'm now going to discuss credit provisioning, starting with balance sheet provisions across the group. The graph on the left of this slide provides an overview of the key movements to balance sheet provisions from 1 January this year to 30th of June. As you can see, provisions increased 31% from ZAR 35 billion to over ZAR 46 billion. The graph in the middle provides a snapshot, the composition of the balance sheet provisions by stages. As you can see, the biggest increase were in stage 2, up 40%; and stage 3, up 31%.</p><p>Turning to Slide 27. Across the top of this slide, you can see loan formation and staging in the period starting with group on the left, PBB in the middle, CIB on the right. Stage 1 loans, as you know under IFRS 9 rules, are performing loans. Stage 2 loans have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. Provisions raised against stage 1 and stage 2 loans are largely driven by macroeconomic experiences. Stage 3 loans are considered impaired and provisions against these loans are driven by idiosyncratic factors applicable to the specific portfolio or the individual name.</p><p>Across the top of the slide, you can see that stage 2 and stage 3 loans have increased as a proportion of the loan books. And this indicates higher levels of stress in the portfolio. Stage 3 loans have increased to 4.6% of the entire book, and this is up 3.9% in the prior period.</p><p>Across the bottom of the slide, you can see the corresponding buildup in the balance sheet provisions and our detailed modeling indicated was appropriate at this point in the crisis. It is evident that provisions have grown faster than balances in all instances, and overall coverage ratios have increased from 2.9% to 3.3%.</p><p>In PBB South Africa, we provided unprecedented relief to clients, mainly in the form of payment holidays and term extensions during the period. The loan book, subject to relief conditions, amounted to ZAR 107 billion at 30th of June, and that is 18% of the portfolio.</p><p>Slide 28 covers balance sheet -- PBB SA balance sheet provisions in detail. And to enable a detailed analysis, we have shown the client relief portfolio separately. 20% of the balances in the client relief portfolio had experienced a deterioration in their risk profile, and hence, were classified as stage 2 loans. But less than 1% of the portfolio that had been retrenched received 0 turnover or experienced permanent loss of income. And these loans, of course, will move then into Stage 3.</p><p>Using soft guidance and our detailed provision models, we calculated that provisions of ZAR 2.6 billion were required to be held against the relief portfolio in expectation of defaults as the restructured terms are normalized. It is important to note that the clients provided with relief through restructures were all performing at the time of being granted relief, and so we are comfortable with the lower coverage ratio on this portfolio.</p><p>Overall, PBB SA's coverage ratios have increased from 4.3% to 5.3%, and we are confident that collateral values and recoveries are being consistently and conservatively revalued.</p><p>Turning to Slide 29. I will take you through the PBB SA income statement charge for credit. As reflected on the graph on the left-hand side, PBB SA's total credit charge for the period was ZAR 7.7 billion and 2.6x higher than that of the first half of 2019. This translated into a credit loss ratio of 261 basis points.</p><p>The waterfall graph reflects the buildup of the charge, which can be analyzed into 3 main buckets: bucket number one, stage 3 impairments. These impairments amounting to ZAR 4.9 billion arose in the ordinary course of lending, where clients' prospects of repayment deteriorated in the period. Our normal credit models and processes were applied here.</p><p>Bucket number two, forward-looking assumption changes. Our credit models are required under IFRS 9 to apply forward-looking assumptions. We have shown it separately because our forward-looking assumptions changed materially between reporting periods. This change in assumptions added ZAR 600 million and ZAR 76 million to the charge, taking our forward-looking assumption provision on balance sheet to ZAR 2 billion.</p><p>Bucket number three, income statement charge for provisions required against the COVID-19 client relief book was an additional ZAR 2.1 billion with stage 2 and 3 impairments.</p><p>In PBB Africa Regions, the client relief portfolio amounted to ZAR 10.9 billion, and that is 12% of the book, with most of this book in stage 1. Our PBB exposures in Africa Regions have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in South Africa, and this can be attributed to less severe lockdowns in these economies. Coverage ratios have been strengthened in this book, from 5.6% to 6.5%.</p><p>Moving to the PBB Africa Regions income statement charge on Slide 31. Starting on the left-hand side again, PBB Africa Regions charges increased to ZAR 883 million. This translated in a credit loss ratio of 206 basis points.</p><p>Turning again to the waterfall graph, the analysis is similar. Stage 3 impairments where the largest increase in the charge of the back of increased stage 3 loans in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda. In Africa Regions, notable recoveries assisted in diluting the charge. Forward-looking assumption charges in Africa Region contributed an additional ZAR 141 million charge, bringing the total balance sheet forward-looking provision to over ZAR 500 million for PBB Africa Regions portfolios. And the additional COVID-19-related provisions added another ZAR 109 million to the charge.</p><p>Moving to CIB. Credit impairment charges on Slide 32 and starting on the left-hand side, CIB's charges increased ZAR 2.2 billion. This translated into a credit loss ratio to customers of 88 basis points. CIB Stage 3 charge is based on granular and specific name-by-name risk review of underlying exposures. Forward-looking information is integrated into the ratings review processes, and probability of default modeling and is therefore not shown separately.</p><p>In addition to the BU model impairment charges, we have raised an additional central provision amounting to ZAR 500 million as an additional buffer to cater for the realization of a more bearish outlook that our models have catered for. The outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable, and this makes determining scenarios and the underlining assumptions, determining them, complex.</p><p>Given this uncertainty, the group has deemed it appropriate to recognize an additional judgmental credit adjustment on the total loans advances to customers' portfolio. Overall, for the group, you can see here the credit impairment charge increased to ZAR 11.3 billion.</p><p>We continue to reevaluate the depth and expected duration of the current downturn to ensure the appropriate strategies are in place. These include our heightened focus on reidentification of distressed accounts, increased collection capabilities, efficiencies and proactive rehabilitation policies and process.</p><p>Based on available data and our scenario-based analysis, we are appropriately provided for the severity of the current crisis. However, the outcome of the pandemic is by no means clear, and further provisions may be required should the outlook deteriorate beyond our BU case scenario.</p><p>Moving on to operating expenses on Slide 34. Cost growth, as you can see, was well contained at 1.8%, supporting positive jaws of 100 basis points. Staff costs were 1% as any salary increases were offset by lower headcount and lower performance-related incentives. Other costs increased 3% as lockdown-driven reduction in discretionary spend, for example travel and entertainment, were offset by increases in IT costs, which were up 26%.</p><p>The investment in customer proposition development was accelerated, particularly in customer journeys and in Global Markets systems investments. The cost of skilled contractors has displaced staff costs in the period. We struggled to source permanent staff with the required skills. Additional expenditure incurred in the period as we upgraded remote access and firewall software to enable our people to work off-site.</p><p>Slide 35 provides a breakdown of our total IT spend for the first 6 months over the last 5 years. Despite the difficult operating environment, we continued our investment to transform to a future-ready group. Our total IT function spend increased 16% in the period and 6% per annum over the last 4 years. The main drivers of this expense were investments in turnkey consultants, software licenses, hardware expenses, data lines and cloud subscription services.</p><p>Turning to Liberty on Slide 36. Liberty's performance, as you know, was negatively impacted by higher morbidity and mortality claims, new business trend and the creation of a ZAR 3 billion pandemic provision to cover future costs related to COVID-19. STANLIB South Africa reported improved earnings for the period as well as increased net external third-party client cash inflows. The shareholder investment portfolio performance reflected negative investment market returns, particularly in respect of foreign and local equity position.</p><p>Liberty reported a headline loss of ZAR 2.3 billion compared to the profit of ZAR 2 billion in the prior period, after adjusting for treasury shares and the group's 57% of the loss amounted to ZAR 707 million. Liberty remains well capitalized, they're financially strong and remains a very important part of our holistic client offering.</p><p>Turning to other banking interests, which historically included our minority stakes in ICBC Standard Bank plc and ICBCArgentina. Starting with ICBCS on Slide 37.</p><p>As reflected in the graph on the left-hand side, ICBCS recorded a profit of $70 million in the period. This was a much improved outcome relative to the loss of $130 million in the prior period. Turnaround was driven by the nonrepeat of a single client loss last year, revenues earned on the back of the market volatility experienced this year and an insurance recovery payment related to the aluminum-related losses in the business incurred in Qingdao in 2015. The group's 40% share of ICBCS' earnings equated to just over ZAR 500 million.</p><p>Moving to Slide 38. This provides a summary of the accounting implications of the sale of ICBC Argentina. In August 2019, the group exercised its option to sell its 20% stake in ICBC Argentina to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. From September 2019 onwards, the investment was recognized as held for sale, and the group ceased recognizing its share of profits. A debit FCTR reserve accumulated over the life of investment due to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso versus the rand.</p><p>The sale was completed on the 29th of June 2020. And on completion, the group recognized a gain on sale of ZAR 1.4 billion. At this same time, the accumulated FCTR reserve of ZAR 3.4 billion was released to earnings. The net impact of ZAR 2 billion negatively impacted earnings attributable to the group in this period, but this was outside of headline earnings.</p><p>Moving to capital and liquidity. Slide 39 provides an overview of the group's capital stack and common equity Tier 1 ratios over the last 4.5 years as well as our liquidity ratios. Despite the very difficult operating environment and shock to earnings in the period, the group has maintained robust capital and liquidity position.</p><p>Our capital levels increased to ZAR 205 billion with a strong IFRS 9 phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.6%. The group's liquidity position remains strong with a net stable funding ratio in excess of the 100% regulatory requirement. The group's Basel III liquidity ratio amounted to 136%, while in excess of the temporarily reduced minimum regulatory requirement of 80%.</p><p>As we saw in the previous slide, the group ended the period with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.6%, down from 14% at year-end. The waterfall graph on the left-hand slide provides a summary of the key drivers of the decline on the CET1 ratio in the period. As you can see, the increase in RWAs, risk-weighted assets in other words, was the key driver. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided a breakdown of the risk-weighted assets as at 31st of December and 30th of June on either end of the graph, as well as the drivers of this RWA growth.</p><p>Credit RWAs, the biggest category and reflected in the dark blue bars, increased 23% over the period, with CIB driving this increase on the back of our bigger loan book, increased staging of loans, credit rating migrations and higher loss given default assumptions. Importantly, at our current capital levels of a 12.6% stage 1 ratio, we could have absorbed almost 6.6x the credit charges and remained above the regulatory minimum or common equity Tier 1.</p><p>Slide 41 provides the ROE over the last 5 comparative periods, the key drivers of the decline in this period, most notably the decline in headline earnings, as you would expect.</p><p>I will now take you through the results of our 2 business units, PBB and CIB. On Slide 43, we have set out the PBB's results. PBB's pre-provision operating profits declined by 6% as revenues declined 1% and costs increased by 2%. As discussed, PBB's credit charges increased to ZAR 8.6 billion, which resulted in headline earnings dropping by 60%.</p><p>Geographically, PBB SA was impacted by negative endowment, elevated impairments, low transactional volumes and a significant decline in loan disbursements in the second quarter, which saw headline earnings dropping by 68% to ZAR 1.6 billion.</p><p>PBB Africa Regions maintained headline earnings at ZAR 500 million on the back of strong revenue growth and positive jaws. Ongoing customer acquisition, balance sheet growth as well as asset management insurance growth were enough to offset subdued activity levels and regulatory directives on fees. Wealth International headline earnings dropped by 34%, with revenues negatively impacted by lower interest rates.</p><p>Structural balance sheet changes require in these offshore entities following the South African sovereign downgrade have also impacted performance. However, underlying client growth has continued with both client numbers and lending balances increase.</p><p>Slide 44 sets out the impact of the pandemic on lending activity levels in PBB South Africa to give you some color to asset formation of revenue generation in the period. As you can see, our mortgage and VAF disbursements were significantly impacted by the lockdown and the deeds office in South Africa was closed during the month of April. In Personal lending, where a fully digital origination alternative exists for clients, we saw digital origination becoming a bigger proportion of lending transaction.</p><p>Slide 45 sets out the transactional activity levels over the period in South Africa. It is clear from these graphs that activity levels improved as lockdowns eased. Customer spend on travel agencies, airlines, hotels, car rentals, restaurants and bars have obviously remained negative throughout the second quarter, while a resumption of activity has been noted in professional services, which includes e-commerce, retail stores, appliances, interiors and hardware stores.</p><p>Turning to CIB and Slide 46. During this period of significant volatility and disruption, CIB continued to proactively engage with clients to provide tailored funding, liquidity and risk management solution. Pre-provision operating profit grew 19% on the period -- on period-on-period, which was a very pleasing result. CIB revenues grew 11%. Cost growth was well contained at 5%, delivering positive jaws of over 6% and an improved cost-to-income ratio below 50%.</p><p>Significant increases in impairment charges were recorded in East Africa, South and Central Africa as well as South Africa. CIB's headline earnings declined by 7% to ZAR 5.7 million. This decline in earnings and increasing capital utilization led to a decline in ROE to 15.1%. Global Markets revenue grew 43% on the back of strong risk management and increased client activity in volatile markets. Africa Regions had a strong half, with revenue increasing by 53%, driven principally by Nigeria and Angola.</p><p>In South Africa, the business maintained its foreign exchange market share and improved its equities market share. Investment in technology platforms resulted in cost growth of 7% for Global Markets. Headline earnings increased a very pleasing 88% to ZAR 4.4 billion. Investment Banking revenues were negatively impacted by muted growth in fees and equity investment write-downs on the back of the difficult economic environment.</p><p>Robust gross loan origination and an increase in drawdowns on unutilized facilities supported average balances, which drove NII growth of 22%. Credit impairment charges increased significantly relative to the first half of 2019, driven by the non-repeat of a prior year recovery, and obviously coupled with deteriorating risk rates and increasing provisioning across the investment banking portfolio.</p><p>Costs were flat. Investment Banking headline earnings declined by 91%, just under ZAR 200 million. Transactional Products and Services revenues were negatively impacted by margin pressure as well as adverse regulatory requirements, in particular in Nigeria. Credit impairment charges increased significantly as certain older Africa region's exposures moved into default. Costs in TPS were well contained despite ongoing investments in digital capabilities and higher AMCON charges in Nigeria. TPS headline earnings decreased by 36% to ZAR 1.2 billion.</p><p>Slide 47 demonstrates CIB's resilience client revenues across our diversified client base. Client revenues increased by 10% in both multinational and domestic client segments. From a sector perspective, financial institutions continue to be the biggest contributor to the business, showing the trust we have built with other banking institutions. The consumer and technology telecoms and media sector has performed well, up 19% and 15%, respectively, weathering the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>In the oil and gas sector, we have closed some material deals in West Africa and are encouraged by the progress being made in the Mozambican gas development. We saw a balanced performance across regions, with West Africa growing by 18%, East Africa, 14%; and South and Central, 12%. The challenges in South Africa are well understood, with the business being flat from prior year. Product performance was covered in the previous slide.</p><p>Moving to our regional performance on Slide 48. The Standard Bank of South Africa's headline earnings declined 72% as the pandemic exacerbated a really difficult environment. This is in contrast to the group's Africa Regions business, which proved relatively resilient, delivering headline earnings growth of 11% and 7% in constant currency.</p><p>West Africa's excellent trading performance and positive jaws delivered 28% in headline earnings in constant currency terms, 28% growth in headline earnings. The top 6 contributors to Africa region's headline earnings remained, Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda.</p><p>Turning next to SBSA on Slide 49. In South Africa, we had a very difficult 6 months. Interrupted power supply extended the fourth quarter 2019 recession into the first quarter of 2020. A sovereign downgrade, the onset of the pandemic and the strict lockdown that followed strangled an already flailing economy.</p><p>Excellent cost discipline, aided by the impact of cost rationalization actions in the prior year, resulted in positive jaws, but this was not enough to offset shrinking revenues, and pre-provision profits declined by 3%. Credit losses in SBSA increased to ZAR 9.8 billion from ZAR 3.5 billion in the prior period. And headline earnings contracted to ZAR 2 billion. SBSA's common equity tier 1 ratio dropped to 11.4%, but remains well above regulatory and internal target rate.</p><p>Our growing franchise African Regions delivered a resilient performance in the period, resulting -- resilient performance in the period against a difficult backdrop. Sub-Sahara and Africa experienced record capital outflows in the period and financial conditions tightened across the board. Trade and foreign exchange inflows dried up and oil exporters were negatively impacted by the lower oil price. Strong positive jaws drove pre-provision profits up 20%. Credit provisions doubled and were somewhat flattened by recoveries in the prior period. This resulted in headline earnings of ZAR 4.8 billion and a return on equity just under 20%.</p><p>On Slide 52, you can see our previously stated medium-term financial targets for the group. COVID-19 has already had a profound impact globally, and there remains much uncertainty as to the ultimate human and economic toll. Therefore, at this stage, there is still too much uncertainty to confirm or revise these targets. What we do know is that activity levels are recovering, and we have capital and liquidity to support this recovery. This is very encouraging.</p><p>But we also know that the pandemic impact on our customers, our employees and our suppliers has been significant. Interest rates are unlikely to pick up for a while. Our outlook may well deteriorate further overall or in pockets, which would have an impact on overall provisioning levels. We continue to run scenarios frequently, and we are ready to stand by our customers through infection peaks and market lows, through transitions and recoveries. Forecast risk clearly remains high, but lockdowns will be rolled back and economies will reopen, and we will remain steadfast in serving our clients and delivering value to all stakeholders.</p><p>We are committed to driving sustainable and inclusive economic growth across Africa. On Slide 53, we have set out demonstrable progress that we have made in the last 6 months driving social, economic and environmental impact. The group spent an additional ZAR 50 million responding to COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, this included the provision of protective equipment, hospital infrastructure and humanitarian support across our country's operation.</p><p>For example, in Stanbic Kenya, we donated just under 200 ventilators to Ministry of Health, almost doubling the number of ventilators available countrywide. Further, with the help of our strategic partner, ICBC, we coordinated the sourcing and delivery of $1.4 million of protective equipment from China. We immediately understood the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for small business in Africa, and over and above direct relief offered to our clients, we were instrumental in setting up and delivering mechanisms for emergency funding.</p><p>On behalf of the SA Future Trust, we lent ZAR 250 million to small businesses to pay the salaries of nearly 23,000 employees. By the end of June, we approved in excess of ZAR 8 billion in loans to businesses via the South African COVID-19 government loan guarantee scheme. We've also underwritten in excess of $2.3 billion for renewable energy projects in Africa, producing 2 gigawatts of power.</p><p>In pursuit of our purpose of driving Africa's growth, we remain purposeful in the allocation of resources. And as Sim mentioned earlier, ESG and our social, economic and environmental responsibility are intrinsically embedded in this allocation of resources.</p><p>Thank you. I will now hand back to Sim to discuss the way forward.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you, Arno. Now it is true to say that they may be some recovery in Global and South African economic activity as early as the second half, but we are definitely not counting on it. We don't know whether or not there will be a large second peak in the Northern Hemisphere. We don't know whether or not the pandemic is still at an early stage in most of Africa, and we don't know how quickly or even if better treatment and vaccines will become widely available.</p><p>Our dominant themes in the second half, therefore, are to remain resilient, to manage our costs and risks very carefully, and to continue supporting our clients and our communities to the best of our ability. We will continue to digitize over the half. This is clearly a no-regrets choice as it will remain equally relevant during and after the pandemic.</p><p>Our broad strategic direction for the medium and longer term remains unchanged. It is our ambition to be a truly digital group of companies providing services, solutions and opportunities that our clients and employees need to achieve growth, prosperity and fulfillment.</p><p>Our key focus areas continue to evolve along with changing client expectations and market conditions. Our commitment to delivering exceptional client experiences has not changed and will not change. But of course, this implies that we need to keep updating our understanding of what our clients expect.</p><p>In light of these expectations, we must now offer an extended range of services and solutions with the speed, agility, reliability and extent of personalization that people have come to expect from leading digital companies.</p><p>To cite our usual example, people no longer merely want a home -- a home loan, they are looking for a set of solutions that will provide them with an affordable, comfortable and well-maintained and safe place to live. The same point applies to our Commercial and corporate clients. Companies are not just looking for fleet finance or for payroll or FX solutions, they are looking for the friction to be taken out of their financial operations so that they can concentrate on their core businesses.</p><p>This, in turn, implies that our other 2 focus areas need to evolve. As discussed earlier, our digital focus area has to create the infrastructure that makes this kind of service possible. In addition to being efficient, robust and secure, it must also provide an integrated and comprehensive view of our clients so that we can understand and anticipate their needs.</p><p>Our third focus area, integrated and collaborative, expresses the idea that we want to provide and expand the range of services in a seamless way and in collaboration with new partners. One way of thinking of this is to say that as well as having a shop, we want to own them all. We will have our own shop, but we will also think about all the other goods and services that our clients are likely to need.</p><p>We will make sure that those services are safely, conveniently and reliably available in our mall. And we will, of course, collect rent from our tenants in return for the space and services that we provide. Finally, we remain purposeful in driving Africa growth, committed to our purpose that Africa is our home that will drive our growth.</p><p>Talking of growth, it is clear that the pandemic has significantly altered the global and African outlooks over the medium and long term. While it is too early to be confident about which changes to the global political economy are likely to persist, we do think that public policy and regulation will probably be more risk-averse, that supply chains will be shorter and more diversified, and that a substantial proportion of economic and social life will have moved online permanently.</p><p>Each of these changes has important consequences for the structure of economies, and we are thinking carefully about how to adapt in the best interest of our shareholders and stakeholders.</p><p>To conclude, I'd like to reemphasize the points made in the opening slide of this presentation. As soon as we understood that we're entering a once-in-a-century global crisis, our attention shifted away from merely financial targets that we had set for ourselves at the end of 2019. Our priorities became doing the right things for our clients, for our staff and for Africa.</p><p>As so often happens, doing the right thing was also the right commercial decision. We earned record revenues. We saw rapid deposit growth and our pre-provision operating profit is pleasing. As you can see, our capital and liquidity positions remain extremely strong. Clearly, our credit experience has been challenging. But as you have seen, it is well managed.</p><p>I can't overemphasize how grateful I am and how impressed I have been by the way Standard Bankers have responded to this crisis. They have shown tremendous courage and they've worked extremely hard. We've all learned a great deal. We are far more digital as an organization than we were in January. Progress that might have taken years has happened in months and in some cases weeks. In general, the pace of the organization has accelerated remarkably. We submit, therefore, that we are very well positioned to support the recovery and to compete successfully after the pandemic.</p><p>We will now go to questions. To assist with your questions, I have with me Arno; and then Zweli Manyathi, Head of PBB; and then, of course, Kenny Fihla, the Head of CIB. Please, would you indicate who your question is for, otherwise, we'll just allocate it on your behalf. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>We will start with the conference call. And if I could just check if there are any questions from the operator on the conference call.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from James Starke.</p><p>JAMES STARKE, ANALYST, SBG SECURITIES (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Four questions from my side, 2 on asset quality. I think the first perhaps for Arno. If you could give us some color to the macro parameters that have shaped the bear case provisioning under IFRS. Second provisioning question and perhaps for Zweli. If you can give us some context on collections, how they were in July, how they compare to June and perhaps pre-lockdown levels on the PB book in aggregate?</p><p>Third question I think maybe for Arno, on the New Business Online and the impairment. You mentioned it's ZAR 2.1 billion pretax. I mean, is there any -- how much is remaining of the book value? And then the last one, just on ICBC Standard, if you can comment on any prospects of any insurance recovery relating to Philadelphia Energy Solutions.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Arno, do you want to go first?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: On the first question, thanks for that, James. On the bear case scenario, we've weighted that by 35%. The macro parameter, which is probably the most relevant there, that assumes a 13.2% GDP, real GDP contraction in South Africa for this year in 2020. Our base case scenario, which is obviously weighted much higher, assumes an 8.5% GDP contraction in South Africa. In Africa Regions, clearly, there is also a contraction priced in on our bear case scenario across the markets, and this is on a weighted average basis, that is at 3% GDP contraction in Africa Regions. That's the first question.</p><p>Maybe I can just continue on this third and fourth questions, then I can hand over to Zweli, I don't know if that's in order. James, you asked on the third question the impairment on NBOL. So it's completely impaired for South Africa. So there's nothing left on the books for South Africa. But clearly, and I think I said that in my commentary, New Business Online is still being used by our clients in Africa regions, and we have not impaired the technology there.</p><p>Then the third point, James, on -- or fourth point, your fourth point on ICBCS. The pace recoveries are uncertain at this point in time. The matter is in the courts, and it's only going to be heard in April next year. So we'll probably in a year's time be able to give you some better guidance on what's happening on pace recovery. But certainly, we are going to be contesting that recovery in the courts next year in April.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Zweli, you're next.</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PERSONAL &amp; BUSINESS BANKING GROUP, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: No, I can [answer] gladly. If I can just respond to James' question on the collections. If we looked at pre-COVID as the benchmark, their clearly evolving [ECM] actually disrupted us from a collections perspective. Social distancing and trying to accommodate our collectors in different environments, that took quite a bit of time with negative impact, obviously, on collections. We did, however, outsourced some of the collections work. And we also got to assist our people from working from either different sites or from home.</p><p>So the consequence of that is we've been seeing 2 things. The improvement in what [budget] is coming to the customers' accounts, which means they're getting better and better, and the collections is continuing to improve very nicely. So month-to-month performance since April has been on a positive trajectory. And we, therefore, expect that, that will have an impact, obviously, in how we look at impairments.</p><p>JAMES STARKE: Sorry, Zweli, if I could follow-on there. Could you perhaps give us some context on by when you expect your collection process or levels to be at a more normalized level?</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Well, James, that's a function of quite a few things. Because a critical driver in successfully collecting is, first, people must have the income into the account. To the extent that the opening up of the economy improves that, we have got, from an operations point of view, we stand ready to deliver the under-collections insofar as we have got enabled our teams now to work from home, driving collections.</p><p>The only question that -- really that is left is, what is going to be the sustained positive impact on customer revenue of the various levels? We're now in level 2, and one assumes that that's going to be better, and therefore, our collections must get better month-on-month.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Operator, any further questions?</p><p>OPERATOR: You have a question from David (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just got 2 questions. First is just if you could provide a bit more detail on the advantage growth in CIB. It seems in Standard Bank growth has been much higher than peers based on BA900 data. If you can just talk more about that. And then the next question just is when do you expect credit impairment charges to peak?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Kenny, I think the first one is for you and the second one is probably better answered by Arno. Do you want to go, Kenny?</p><p>KENNY FIHLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING (CIB), STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Well, thank you very much, Sim, and thanks for the question. The advances growth in CIB cut across all 3 of our businesses, with the main driver being the clients accessing their facilities, particularly at the peak of the sort of lockdown. The actual new loan origination slowed down a bit between March and April, even though we started to see that they're returning slightly to normality around about May and June. But the biggest driver is the actual utilization of existing lines as well as lift.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Okay. I can then answer the second question. The CLR, when that's going to peak. The guidance we've given at the moment is that the CLR may exceed the global financial crisis CLR, which is 160 basis points, and you can see we're currently over that. David, we cannot, at this stage, give you an accurate measure of when that's going to peak. That depends on the various scenarios and the various outcomes we're going to be running. But we continue to expect a higher CLR, obviously, going into the rest of the year and early next year.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you, Arno. Operator?</p><p>OPERATOR: We have a question from Harry Botha also of Avior.</p><p>HARRY BOTHA, BANKS ANALYST, AVIOR CAPITAL MARKETS (PTY) LTD.: Just a question for Arno on the PBB client relief provisioning. It looks like stage 2 -- sorry, stage 1 and stage 2 coverage [seemed] fairly low in South Africa, especially if it's compared to Capitec and other peers' trading updates. You mentioned the discussion, but could you -- could this coverage increase dramatically in H2 as we do start to see some repayment experience, Q3?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. Obviously, Harry, it's difficult to understand what other peer banks have done. We've noted, obviously, the sales sense announcement overlays and so on. Based on our modeling and our calibrations, we do think we are appropriately provided for in stage 1 and stage 2 for the client relief [put further], and we are appropriately covered as well. I didn't quite understand your second part of the question for the rest of the year. What are you implying there?</p><p>HARRY BOTHA: Just essentially, if it changed quite dramatically, that provisioning, in the second half of the year as you do start to see customers essentially start paying the debt again as opposed to being in debt there.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. We have seen a fairly large portion of our client base really starting to repay again, and there's been a good payment history on that. We've got the data, which I'm sure is ready to give you on hand, maybe even in the one-on-one discussions. I think there's a lot of detail around that. But at this stage, we do not expect a dramatic change in our modeling and in our forecast, the provisioning levels, which we've started to put in place.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have no further questions.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you, operator. Sarah, can we go to you? Are there any questions online?</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC, HEAD OF IR, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Yes. Thank you, Sim. Can you hear me?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Yes, we can.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thanks. This question is from Warren Thomas Thompson. What percentage of SBSA's gross loans and advances have been restructured or rolled post June? Perhaps the question for Zweli.</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Yes. Sarah, when we started, we actually gave payment holidays for a period of 3 months. And that was obviously predicated on our assumption that things will gradually improve. But as we all know, they have been greatly improved, but not during COVID periods. So in SA, we had ZAR 107 billion that was given as relief to clients. And as at June, we went back to clients, notably, and we asked them to -- those who are still in a bad position financially, we set them approaches so that we can reconsider whether we extend the period or not. And 50% of our customers asked for further extension.</p><p>And very interestingly, when you look at of the 50% that did not, the repayments are at very, very high numbers. So we're looking at roughly about 92% of customers paying back, those who did not ask for extension ahead. So we believe that that's a good outcome, and we'll continue to manage this portfolio a little bit closely.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Zweli. The next question is from Chris Steward, one for Arno. Could you split the ICBCS profits between insurance recovery and operational performance?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Chris, good to hear from you. I did show it in my slide deck, Chris. I know the slide sequence was slightly out of sync with the wording. Apologies, we have a technical matter there. The split is as follows, I'm just paging forward to that. Operational profit was $45 million for the 6 months. Aluminum recovery on Qingdao Aluminum was $25 million, totaling $70 million.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you. Perhaps next one for you, Arno. [Jared Spheres]. In your prospects summary, you state that a final dividend has not been ruled out. Can you provide any color on that?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. With respect to SARB's guidance note 2 of 2020, which guides us not to declare a dividend. We will have to assess and talk to the SARB on if a further dividend can be declared for the final dividend or if that will be bespoke later. I think you can see from a capital point of view, we are in a sound capital position. So possibly, that is not a constraint from a capital point of view.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Arno. The next question is from Charles Russell. I'm quite surprised at your expectation of performance on the client relief portfolios with 2.5% of provisions. Could you perhaps elaborate on this?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Zweli, do you want to comment on that?</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Yes. Arno, let me comment on it. The process that we followed in thinking about provisions was clearly informed by our modeling. First, we have got a very, very robust model approval process in the bank. And what that model should do is to [not to] predict very, very closely what is likely to happen in [client relief]. So we went through that process. But what we also did is have a forward-looking view in the input as to how we thought about the model.</p><p>In the process of doing that, we followed -- first, we did D3 dive from SARB with -- to get to that. And we calculated using our models, what it looks like, what the future might look like. And we came up to the levels of provisions that Arno discussed earlier.</p><p>And over and above that, we took into consideration the economic prospects, which are not good. The in-house view is that GDP is likely to contract by 8.5%. We took that into consideration. And then we overlaid and came up with the forward-looking view that Arno discussed earlier.</p><p>So in our view, knowing what we know -- and I underscore it, knowing what we know and having used this robust models, we believe that we are appropriately provided. And if the data changes for the worst going forward than our assumptions, of course, we're based on the -- based our decisions on what we know. Arno, I don't know if you want to add something.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes, just 1 or 2 more extra points, Zweli. Thank you very much. So please bear in mind that the clients who were entered and given restructuring terms were all performing. It was a criteria that were all performing at the time of providing the restructured terms. And as I indicated in my narrative earlier on today, hence, the coverage is likely to be expected to be lower than the base portfolio, where a portion is obviously not performing.</p><p>The other data point, Jared, is that what Zweli mentioned earlier on, all those clients who've started paying again, as Zweli pointed out, 92% of them have been paying on time now and this is at the start. So I think that is tracking our expectation.</p><p>And then the third thing, so you would have noted in my discussion I did point out that we've got additional ZAR 500 million overlay at the center, management overlay. If the situation deteriorates beyond what we have modeled, what we have expected, we do have additional buffer, which we feel and the Board feels comfortable to cater for that.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Arno. We could move to [Vincent Antone Raj's] question, it's one for Kenny. Kenny, could you comment on the provisioning, the CIB provisioning, in particular in relation to the real estate and consumer sectors?</p><p>KENNY FIHLA: Thank you for that question, [Vincent]. Because of the lumpy nature of our exposure to individual names and the fact that our client base is fairly manageable, we do a detailed analysis of each and every client and before we decide whether a provision is warranted, what collateral is available, what plans have been put in place, when are they likely to yield specific results. And we have followed exactly that process with regards to the provisions that we've made.</p><p>We have also done a detailed review of each of our exposure in the various sectors, including the retail sector as well as the real estate sector. And we are comfortable that having done the detailed analysis, both at a sector level as well as an individual client level, that the provisions that we have made are adequate under the circumstances. They are based, in fact, sound accounting principle as well as what we consider to be appropriate.</p><p>Of course, that is an ongoing process. The lumpy nature of our exposure is such that if the situation was to deteriorate fairly rapidly within a specific sector or a specific client, the picture could change fairly rapidly over a short period of time, but we are very close to that situation. And at the moment, we're fairly comfortable with what we've provided for them.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Kenny. One more question for you. With regards to trading profits. Obviously, strong in the first half. Do you expect these will be repeated in the second half?</p><p>KENNY FIHLA: We are pleased with the strong trading revenues that have come through from our global market business. The circumstances that created opportunities for excellent trading revenues in the first half of the year have abated somehow. [Stock] vendors have approved, the rand has pulled back. We are starting to see the plateauing of the various interest rate reductions that were being introduced by various regulators across the African continent. So we think that the situation has changed, and we no longer have as much volatility as we had in the first half of the year.</p><p>As a consequence of that, we're likely to see a slowdown or a deceleration in the revenue growth within global market. But it will still be, I think, a decent second half of the year. And because of the momentum that has been created in the first half of the year, we think that has given us sufficient cushion to see as through for the remainder of the year.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Kenny. I've got 2 questions from [Kim Hunan]. The first one for you, Sim. Did the SBG execs made salary sacrifices towards the Solidarity Fund?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: [Kim], the SBG execs have made contributions to various charities in solidarity with various communities as a general proposition. And secondly, yes, executives have also made contributions to the Solidarity Fund, and we just have not made those public. So the answer is an emphatic yes.</p><p>And I want to emphasize that the sacrifices went well beyond the requirements in terms of what the CEOs have committed to following the President's lead. The amounts involved are large, we're just not going to make them public.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Sim. The second question is for Arno. Can you provide some insight with regards to paying preference dividends in the second half of 2020?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: [Kim], good to hear from you again. We will be paying preference share dividends now, and we are likely to pay them again in the second half. The SARB guidance not does not apply to preference share dividends, it only applies to ordinary dividends. And we have the capital resources available to pay for those dividends on preference shares. So the answer is yes.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Arno. One question from [Stuart Bold] for Zweli. Can you comment on how much you've lent in terms of the ZAR 200 billion government guarantee lending scheme?</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Sorry, Sarah, I didn't quite get the last piece of the question. How much share did we lent...</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: It's actually guaranteed scheme.</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Yes. Thank you, Sim. We actually approved about ZAR 8.1 billion, but we have paid out just below ZAR 2 billion because you approved and then there are conditions that must be met, you must contract with the customers. So this gap between the approval and the payout, so that's how much we've paid. And the way we've worked with it is make customers choose which of the solutions they want to go for. If they want to go for the government guarantee, we have to take them through the process, and that's where we're at.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Zweli. The last question is for Arno. Could you comment on your capital outlook for the rest of the year?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: We expect the capital outlook to continue to remain robust across all the markets in which we operate.</p><p>SARAH RIVETT-CARNAC: Thank you, Arno. Then that's all the questions for now. Thank you very much.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Yes. Thank you so much for conducting that process. That brings us to an end of today's proceedings, colleagues. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you for your support. Hopefully, we'll see you again soon, and hopefully, that will be in person. In the meantime, we wish you all good health and strength in the coming months. Bye-bye.</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI: Bye.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Thank you.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you, Arno.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Die \u00fcbergeordnete Frage: Wie kann die   Zusammenarbeit zwischen Regierungen und Big-Tech-Firmen wie Facebook in Zeiten   der Coronavirus-Pandemie und dar\u00fcber hinaus aussehen?</p><p>Die Frage ist berechtigt. Schlie\u00dflich spielen   Softwareunternehmen und Onlinedienste eine wichtige Rolle in der Krise, positiv   wie negativ. Einerseits sorgen sie daf\u00fcr, dass \u00fcberhaupt so viele Menschen von   zu Hause aus arbeiten k\u00f6nnen und mit Partnern, Freunden und Familienmitgliedern   in Kontakt bleiben. Andererseits gibt es immer wieder Berichte \u00fcber Datenschutzprobleme. Und die Bek\u00e4mpfung von Falschnachrichten   und Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien in sozialen Netzwerken erh\u00e4lt im   Kontext der Pandemie noch einmal eine neue Dringlichkeit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook will Nutzer   nach Covid-19-Symptomen befragen</emphasis></p><p>Prinzipiell sind sich Zuckerberg und Breton   einig: Die Krise kann nur gemeinsam bew\u00e4ltigt werden, Tech-Branche und   Politik m\u00fcssen zusammenr\u00fccken  auch im Hinblick auf die von der EU geplante neuen Digitalstrategie f\u00fcr den Binnenmarkt, deren Details in diesem Jahr ausgearbeitet werden sollen.</p><p>Wie eine Zusammenarbeit genau gestaltet werden k\u00f6nnte, lie\u00dfen beide Seiten w\u00e4hrend des informellen Gespr\u00e4chs unerw\u00e4hnt. \"Es ist wichtig, nicht nur zu reagieren,   sondern zu antizipieren, was in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren auf uns   zukommen wird\", sagte Breton. Das gelte f\u00fcr Vereinbarungen beim   Klimaschutz ebenso wie f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung: Die Telearbeit werde f\u00fcr viele   Menschen auch in Zukunft ein wichtiger Bestandteil ihres Alltags sein. Deshalb   sei es umso wichtiger, fr\u00fchzeitig die Regeln zu definieren und klarzustellen,   dass es keine neuen Gatekeeper gebe, sagte Breton. Und auch der Kampf gegen Desinformation,   laut Breton \"die Krankheit des Jahrzehnts\", sei unabdingbar f\u00fcr die   Demokratie.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, aus Kalifornien zugeschaltet, stimmte dem grunds\u00e4tzlich zu und schien gewillt, mit der EU, deren Richtlinien er in vielerlei Hinsicht als Goldstandard f\u00fcr den Rest der Welt sieht, zusammenzuarbeiten. Auf die Rolle von Facebook in der Pandemie angesprochen betonte er, was das Netzwerk in den vergangenen Wochen in dieser Hinsicht schon alles erreicht habe. Vieles   davon erz\u00e4hlt er freilich schon seit Jahren, etwa dass mittlerweile Zehntausende Moderatoren gemeldete Inhalte auf der Plattform \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Oder dass   k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz mittlerweile immer mehr Aufgaben \u00fcbernehme und man   nat\u00fcrlich versuche, Falschnachrichten weiter einzud\u00e4mmen.</p><p>Der Gr\u00fcnder machte auch noch mal Werbung f\u00fcr die Ma\u00dfnahmen, die man in der Pandemie angek\u00fcndigt hatte, Stichwort vorausschauend handeln: Facebook wolle gezielt kleine   Unternehmer und Gesch\u00e4fte beim E-Commerce unterst\u00fctzen. Au\u00dferdem wolle sich das   soziale Netzwerk bei seinen Nutzerinnen und Nutzer in   freiwilligen Umfragen erkundigen, wie es ihnen gesundheitlich gehe und welche   Symptome sie h\u00e4tten. Das k\u00f6nne \"Regierungen   und Gesundheitsbeh\u00f6rden wertvolle Informationen liefern, um Entscheidungen zu   treffen, ob und wie man die Wirtschaft wieder \u00f6ffnen kann\", sagte   Zuckerberg.</p><p>Kritische Nachfragen, etwa hinsichtlich der fehlenden Transparenz   von KI-Algorithmen oder der unklaren   Aussagekraft von medizinischen Onlineumfragen im Kontext von Covid-19,   lieferten weder der Moderator, Cerre-Direktor Bruno Liebhaberg noch Thierry Breton.   Der EU-Kommissar mahnte stattdessen vor Alleing\u00e4ngen der Onlineplattformen und   verwies auf den Erfolg, den er im M\u00e4rz mit Vertretern der Tech-Branche feiern   konnte. Plattformen wie Facebook oder Netflix hatten nach einem Gespr\u00e4ch mit   Breton vor\u00fcbergehend die \u00dcbertragungsqualit\u00e4t von Streams in Europa gedrosselt,   um das Internet nicht zu \u00fcberlasten.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Die EU ist gewillt, die Plattformen zu regulieren</emphasis></p><p>Breton, der vor seinem Amtsantritt als EU-Kommissar im   vergangenen Dezember viele Jahre Chef von Technologiefirmen wie France T\u00e9l\u00e9com   und Atos war, also auch die Unternehmensseite bestens kennt, scheint seine   Rolle anders zu definieren als seine Vorg\u00e4nger. Man m\u00f6chte sagen: hemds\u00e4rmeliger.   Wie auch das Gespr\u00e4ch mit Zuckerberg zeigte, sucht Breton den direkten   Austausch, scheut dabei aber auch nicht vor klaren Ansagen zur\u00fcck: \"Am   Ende des Tages ist die Aufgabe des Chefs, sich alles anzuh\u00f6ren und eine   Entscheidung zu treffen. Und am Ende des Tages ist es Mark, der verantwortlich   sein wird, niemand sonst\", sagte Breton. \"Haltet euch nicht f\u00fcr zu schlau.\"</p><p>Zwischen den Zeilen des insgesamt kooperativen Gespr\u00e4chs   lie\u00df Breton also doch durchblicken, dass die EU-Kommission gewillt ist, die gro\u00dfen   Plattformen st\u00e4rker zu regulieren, sollten diese nicht den EU-Vorgaben   hinsichtlich des Datenschutzes, der Datenweitergabe und Bek\u00e4mpfung von Desinformation   folgen. Etwas, das auch Mark Zuckerberg als m\u00f6gliche Option sieht: \"Ein   neuer, digitaler Deal scheint unumg\u00e4nglich\", sagt er. Allerdings warnte   der Facebook-Gr\u00fcnder auch vor zu starken Eingriffen. Regulierung, wie sie etwa   in China stattfinde, d\u00fcrfe nicht zum Vorbild f\u00fcr westliche Demokratien werden.</p><p>Am Ende des einst\u00fcndigen Gespr\u00e4chs gab es wie zu erwarten keine   wirklich neuen Erkenntnisse. Aber es k\u00f6nnte die erste Runde von vielen seien,   die Breton und Zuckerberg in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren austragen werden. Sp\u00e4testens dann, wenn es um die Details der neuen Digitalstrategie geht und die Vorgaben f\u00fcr die Plattformen ausgearbeitet werden. Und nicht immer wird der Ton so freundlich sein.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ZEITOL-PMG49285387ZEDE20200519httpxmlzeitdedigitalinternet202005technikbranchemarkzuckerbergthierrybretonregulierung</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ZEITOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY0-KBN1-F15W-B0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">353194</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><timeReceived>9:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius GmbH &amp; Co.

He responded with a quote from the musical 'Hamilton' saying, 'He wanted to be 'in the room where it happens' \u2014 as important decisions were being made and influenced. I thought about this quote and it struck me there are quite a few one-liners from Hamilton applicable to the conundrum facing the leaders of large tech and other companies in how they deal with the Trump administration.The World turned Upside DownUnder the Obama administration, tech companies and their leaders occupied privileged positions. </p><p>As advisors and even members of the administration, with a fairly free flow of personnel between Silicon Valley and the White House, and lots of other, mostly positive, interactions. However, during the presidential campaign last year, it became clear this relationship would be very different should Trump win. He singled out Amazon and Apple in particular for criticism and suggested he would exert pressure on both as president. In many cases, tech leaders have gone from being the smartest in the room to being on the outside.In the Room where It HappensNo wonder CEOs like Bob Iger have tried to seize what opportunities they've had to interact with the administration and try to exert influence. Elon Musk has officially explained his cooperation with the administration in similar ways. Meanwhile, Travis Kalanick was attacked for his presence on one of the president's advisory councils until he finally stepped down, having initially made the same argument.Talk Less, Smile MoreThe line about being 'in the room where it happens' belongs to Aaron Burr, the villain of Hamilton, whose defining characteristic is refusing to take or state a position on any issue for fear of backing the wrong horse. He argues Hamilton should 'talk less, smile more', a policy exhibited by a number of prominent tech CEOs at a meeting with Donald Trump late last year (grimacing was perhaps a better description for some of the faces on display). At that early stage, it felt as if these leaders of industry had been cowed into submission, fearful of speaking up and angering the administration. Yet, these executives have important agendas to push with any administration, including regulatory reform, repatriation of overseas cash, and immigration for skilled workers.The Same Rights as You and IThe tipping point for engagement with the administration seems to have come with the executive orders on immigration signed in late January, which led to protests in airports and calls to boycott businesses which seemed to be going along with the policy (notably Uber). Though some of the early statements from tech companies focused on the direct impact on their businesses from restrictions on immigration, those quickly spread to moral condemnations of the limits on refugees entering the country and other elements of the policy. It seemed the tech companies had suddenly found a voice which had been lacking in the early weeks of the new administration and they were using it forcefully. Several joined lawsuits against the orders, which were successful in halting the ban on immigration, at least temporarily.History has Its Eyes on YouThe big tech companies seem to be more concerned now with angering their employees, and at least some of their customers, than with angering the administration. They've continued to weigh in on subsequent policies such as access to bathrooms in schools for transgender students. But, as I've argued elsewhere, it's an open question whether these companies have a duty to represent first and foremost their shareholders, their employees, their customers, or a set of values independent of any of those individual groups. We've already seen the backlash against companies like Starbucks for promising to hire refugees, for example. Both today's customer and history will judge these companies and their leaders for their actions but it's far from clear all customers feel the same way about these issues - indeed, polls have suggested a majority were in favor of the executive orders on immigration.Do You Know how Hard It is to Lead?In this context, it must be very tempting to follow Aaron Burr's advice and keep quiet on the major issues of the day, given that any strong views expressed on these controversial subjects are likely to alienate at least some customers (and, potentially, employees too). And yet, many people in Silicon Valley and beyond are looking to these companies for leadership - tech companies have been among the most outspoken on the administration's policies, in part as a reflection of the relatively liberal workforces they employ. Do these companies want to lead on these and other issues over the next four years? Do they want to face the consequences?This is not a MomentThe back-and-forth between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, as portrayed in the musical, mirrors what must be the internal discussion happening at a lot of tech companies. Hamilton, of course, ultimately wins out in terms of position and prestige but is ultimately (historical spoiler alert) killed by Burr, so the outcome there was mixed to say the least. It may well be he same for tech companies as they continue to work through how to engage with an administration that continues to exert a lot of power over their fate. And, of course, this isn't just a moment in time - this relationship is going to continue to play out throughout the course of this administration. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCHP1289261489056627243251766500254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHP-128926</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N23-4651-F03R-N3M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><timeReceived>10:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tech.pinions</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 9, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

He defended this thesis by reminding those at the hearing that Google was not a mystical force, but rather run by people. 'It's a computer program written and maintained by people.' You don't say:Google Exec Says Infowars ...ex Jones Will Soon Be Unsearchable On YouTube[2] A Google executive claimed that Alex Jones and Infowars would soon be completely eradicated from its video platform YouTube. Speaking during a Senate hearing on Tuesday over its censorship practices, Google's VP for Government Affairs ...blic Policy Karan Bhatia assured known Alex Jones-hater Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) that the company was doing everything in its power to remove all content related to the Infowars host after the senator invoked Sandy Hook. Cruz and other defenders of liberty need to do more than 'hammer' Google verbally. They need to hammer it into pieces, and then regulate the hell out of those pieces, to the point that pocket techno-stalins like Bhatia have no place in the workings of whatever remains. People like her, and entities like Google, which consist of people like her, are deadly enemies to liberty and the America that still seeks to guarantee and nurture liberty.Click the Frog to Follow Me On GAB <url normalizedValue=\"https://gab.com/icebergwtq\">https://gab.com/icebergwtq</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/corinne-weaver/2019/07/16/senator-ted-cruz-hammers-google-you-control-our-discourse\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/corinne-weaver/2019/07/16/senator-ted-cruz-hammers-google-you-control-our-discourse</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infowars.com/google-exec-says-infowars-alex-jones-will-soon-be-unsearchable-on-youtube\">https://www.infowars.com/google-exec-says-infowars-alex-jones-will-soon-be-unsearchable-on-youtube</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DPUN1008711563376141776251763300245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPUN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-76R1-F03R-N4GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"345\"/><timeReceived>3:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Pundit</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook, one of the world's biggest businesses, generated global revenue of more than \u00a330 billion last year and is valued at almost \u00a3350 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the social network paid the equivalent of only 19 pence for every one of its estimated 39 million British users.</p><p>The chancellor raised the prospect of Britain pushing forward with a digital services tax in his speech to the Conservative Party conference last week when he said that the \"time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop\".</p><p>Damian Collins, the Tory chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, urged Mr Hammond yesterday not to delay.</p><p>\"Facebook should be paying a level of tax which more accurately reflects the value of their business in the UK,\" he said. \"That's why I've called for a levy on big tech companies like Facebook to fund online media literacy in schools.\"</p><p>His call was echoed by Dame Margaret Hodge, Labour chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on responsible tax, who described Facebook's payment as \"absolutely outrageous\". She said: \"It may be legal, but it is not moral, especially when the company depends on so many public services funded by the taxpayer.\"</p><p>Meg Hillier, Labour chairwoman of the public accounts committee, added: \"Facebook's paltry UK tax bill underlines the unfairness of the current tax system, which allows multinational digital giants to use every loophole to reduce their bill while bricks-andmortar high-street businesses are hit hard. We need to see a real step change in how tax is levied from business.\"</p><p>Accounts filed at Companies House show that Facebook UK Limited posted a rise in revenue to \u00a31.27 billion in the UK last year, but its pre-tax profits of \u00a362.8 million, up from \u00a358.4 million the year before, were reduced by \"cost of sales\" of \u00a3758.7 million and \"administrative expenses\" of \u00a3444.5 million. It meant that Facebook paid corporation tax of \u00a315.8 million, up from \u00a35.1 million. Its net tax was \u00a37.4 million, however, after it received \u00a38.4 million in tax credits from employee shares awards.</p><p>The Conservative MP Nicky Morgan pledged that the Treasury committee, of which she is chairwoman, would \"keep a close watch on developments on the taxation of digital companies\".</p><p>Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex and an adviser to the Commons' work and pension select committee, said: \"The key question is what is the company's taxable profit in the UK? \u2026 It seems to me that HMRC needs to be asking questions about the 4.9 per cent operating profit margin declared in the UK compared with nearly 50 per cent shown in the US accounts. What is the economic basis of such enormous differences?\" Facebook argued that it had made significant investments in Britain over the past couple of years. The company said that it was preparing to employ about 2,300 people in Britain by the end of the year and was doubling its office space in London, with the \"capacity for more than 6,000 workstations by 2022\".</p><p>A spokesman added: \"We have also changed the way we report tax so that revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is recorded in the UK and any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\"</p><p>The government declined to comment on Facebook but a spokesman issued a warning. \"While the UK has led the way internationally to ensure companies change their behaviour and pay the right amount of tax, the international tax system needs to be rebalanced and modernised to ensure it's fair for all businesses,\" he said.</p><p>\"If we can't get international engagement to do this we may have to look at temporary tax measures on digital businesses to level the playing field and ensure multinationals pay their fair share towards vital public services like schools and hospitals.\"</p><p>The dispute came as it emerged that the tax affairs of another US technology business were facing scrutiny. The holiday lettings site Airbnb admitted that it had been contacted by HM Revenue &amp; Customs \"regarding the application of tax laws or regulations\" affecting its business. It added that some of these matters \"may result in litigation\".</p><p>The company paid less than \u00a3600,000 in corporate tax in Britain last year, with profits channelled through its headquarters in Ireland. A spokesman said: \"As with many other companies, these are routine checks and we are working closely with HMRC.\"</p><p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \"The Tories are letting large multinationals get away without paying their fair share of tax. Philip Hammond has let Facebook off the hook.\"</p><p>Judge blocks Google, page 21</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-142397498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFH-0JN1-DYTY-C0X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, the series ends with market power: ad technology dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As German publisher Axel Springer's senior vice-president Dietrich von Kl\u00e4den told the INMA, all news media companies today \"are facing the challenges of a dysfunctional online advertising market in which two-thirds of the advertising revenues are going to two global digital platforms.</p><p>\"High-quality journalism is expensive to produce,\" he said. \"At the moment, the platforms take all journalistic content and use it without adequate financial compensation.\"</p><p>Publishers and advertisers often have no choice but to use - and sometimes pay for - a tech giant's related tools and products when wanting to advertise or publish content on their platforms. These tools offer little transparency around policies and processes including ad exchanges, which are digital marketplaces that allow companies and publishers to buy and sell advertising space, often through real-time auctions.</p><p>Google's market share of ad exchange services is 66 per cent. Its closest competitor holds 11 per cent of the market. Google used that dominance in April to launch \"unified pricing rules,\" which stopped publishers from setting granular pricing, limiting how they compete. A month later it dealt publishers another blow when it introduced a \"fair access agreement\" requiring competitors to provide Google with visibility on all their bids and transactions.</p><p>Possible solutions:</p><p>Revamp fees, commissions and revenue sharing.</p><p>Platforms should lower fees they impose on publishers for everything from web hosting to licences for technologies - because publishers are engaged in working for the public good and producing quality journalism, INMA says. It believes such a solution is possible because it has already seen platforms strive to be flexible in signing different revenue fee deals based on the size and prominence of news publishers. Facebook, INMA points out, has led the way by introducing a news subscription tool at no cost or hidden fees for publishers. \"This improved on Google's attempt to undercut Apple by introducing a 5 per cent fee for a subscription transaction, which Google has said repeatedly is only to cover its cost,\" INMA says.</p><p>Allow publishers to collectively bargain with the platforms for better terms.</p><p>INMA says Facebook and Google account for about 90 per cent of all digital advertising revenue growth, so \"they exert enormous power over publishers in all negotiations.\" Lawmakers and advocates behind the U.S. Journalism Competition and Preservation Act are attempting to change that by pushing for publications to land the ability to collectively negotiate fairer advertising revenue pricing terms without the threat of legal recourse from platforms and regulating agencies. They are hoping the act will trigger algorithm stability, increase publisher access to data, end the suppression of media brands and deliver funds to publishers. They believe the act will give them leverage to argue that because Facebook and Google license and pay for other kinds of content, including music, they should be willing to pay for news.</p><p>Remove ad sales conflicts.</p><p>INMA is calling for the regulation of ad pricing, independent auditing of the practice and the restriction of forced bundling of tools, services and products. Given that regulators have been unable to stop Google from repeatedly swallowing up ad tech businesses, INMA would also like to see Google separate its ad technologies from its advertising business and hold them in a separate, possibly independent trust. INMA believes this could lower costs and drive competition in the ad market.</p><p>Ad tech regime.</p><p>INMA has suggested tech companies could create an independent, non-profit ad tech regime that links clients directly with all entertainment, music, news and web publishing companies.</p><p>INMA believes this would reduce fees and repatriate most or all of the 70 per cent of ad money that currently disappears to intermediaries standing between advertisers and publishers.</p><p>National ID sign-ons.</p><p>A global initiative that would create national identification sign-ons across banking, telecommunications companies, retail and news media using hyper-secure technology could quash the destructive allure of using platforms for sign-ins, INMA argues. Such a sign-in would be as simple to use as those currently operated by tech platforms, but would bypass the platforms altogether, allow data to be collected and ensure power is not consolidated by the digital giants. It would also disrupt Apple's current model, which requires apps in its App Store with social login opportunities to offer sign-ins with Apple ID.</p><p>Apple does not share that data with publishers unless a consumer opts in and beginning later this year INMA says a new feature will allow consumers to sign up by default through an anonymized email address Apple provides to a publisher.</p><p>Last in a Star series examining the effect of powerful global digital platforms on the news industry.</p><p>News in the era of big tech</p><p>Other stories include:</p><p>Media and big tech face off in digital age</p><p>Copyright and news aggregation</p><p>Privacy and consumer data</p><p>Tax status</p><p>Fake news and fake ads</p><p>Quality subscription content</p><p>Platform news tax</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019102356084716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBB-M2B1-JBTY-W00Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"904\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001NQF</classCode><className>AXEL SPRINGER SE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

From the spreading of religion-based hate messages in Sri Lanka, and the role of WhatsApp in Indian lynchings, to the murder of two women passengers in China using Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing app, Asian lawmakers face challenges protecting consumers and holding tech companies accountable. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the west, the authorities have started to crack down hard. France, for example, used the EU's newly-drafted General Data Privacy Rules (GDPR) in January to fine Google 50 million euros ($57 million) for not fully informing users how it collects personal information, and for failing to obtain their consent for personalized ads. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is drafting a data privacy law, amid widespread concern over data privacy. </p><p>The authorities in Asia are struggling to catch up, even though social media in the region often plays an even bigger role than in the west. </p><p>The states of Southeast Asia face particular challenges, as compared to the large jurisdictions of the U.S., the EU, China and even Japan, because their citizens live in a tightly-linked regional economy. </p><p>The Association of South East Asian Nations must build trust between consumers, companies and governments in a healthy digital ecosystem. Cooperation among ASEAN members is essential for the cross-border management of the digital economy, and to avoid regulatory arbitrage, in which companies seek to game regional variations in corporate law. </p><p>ASEAN needs frameworks that ensure clarity for tech companies on handling user data, and transparency for customers on how their data is being used. The two big dangers are irresponsible data collecting and sharing, and anti-competitive actions. </p><p>Consumer-facing tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have come under fire for their seemingly indiscriminate personal data collection practices. These tech titans harvest user data by aggregating and selling it to third parties for use in targeted advertising. While some may argue that, in exchange for their data, users benefit from tech companies' services, companies end up extracting a lot more value from the relationship than their customers. </p><p>Without adequate data privacy laws, user data is vulnerable to theft and companies fail to act, as exemplified by the data breaches that have occurred in Southeast Asia. Last year, for example, a researcher found that the personal information of 46,000 mobile customers with Thai mobile operator, True Corp, was publicly available on Amazon Web Services. In response, True Corp defended its security measures, and accused the researcher of hacking its customers' data. </p><p>In a far bigger case, Malaysia in 2017 investigated an attempt by hackers to sell the personal information of 46.2 million mobile customers online. This huge data breach may have affected nearly all Malaysia's citizens. </p><p>To address the region's patchwork of data privacy laws, ASEAN must work on two levels. At the regional level, it needs a consensus on the concepts underpinning data protection, using the ASEAN Framework on Personal Data Protection and the recently endorsed Framework on Digital Data Governance as starting points. </p><p>At the national level, ASEAN states should develop comprehensive data privacy laws while consulting each other, with guidelines for companies on responsible personal data collection and on handling breaches. </p><p>ASEAN members need robust and interoperable data privacy frameworks. At present, a few states such as Brunei and Myanmar lack data privacy laws, while, at the other extreme, Indonesia and Vietnam have sweeping legislations. The gaps need closing so that all are on the same regulatory page. </p><p>Singapore, for its part, has recognized the importance of having sound laws that balance user privacy and business innovation, and its Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) actively reviews laws in light of new tech developments. The PDPC recently issued a Model Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance Framework, the first effort in Asia to address the possibilities and ethics of AI applications. </p><p>Meanwhile, ASEAN regulators should also look out for anticompetitive behavior, enabled by the tech companies' data monopolies. In the U.S. and China, Big Tech has profited from big network effects, meaning that the value of their services has increased as more customers use them. Network effects help to entrench tech platforms, making it necessary for customers to use their services to shop, travel, and bank. Companies further solidify their market dominance by monetizing their services, manipulating customer behavior through data analytics, and profiting from user data. </p><p>In China, the rise of Alibaba and Tencent can be credited to the massive data sets they have accessed in their many services. As super apps, Alibaba and Tencent consolidate diverse features capturing their consumer base through market integration. Aided by aggressive tech acquisitions at home and abroad, these two giants dominate markets not only within China, but in the wider region. </p><p>In the ASEAN context, anticompetitive practices may become an issue with the rise of the super app. Emerging markets within Southeast Asia are primed for super apps, because their consumers tend to be unbanked, mobile-first internet users. Home-grown Grab and Indonesian Go-Jek, which both started as ride-hailing apps, have ambitions of becoming Southeast Asia's first super app. </p><p>While customers may find the integrated services of super apps convenient, they ultimately lose out if the company engages in anticompetitive behavior that drives prices up and blocks rival businesses. Last year, Grab was fined by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) for acquiring Uber's Southeast Asia operations, because the competition watchdog deemed that the merger would result in higher prices for ride-hailing customers. </p><p>It is imperative to build a trustworthy digital ecosystem, while ASEAN's digital economy is still nascent. Once advanced tech such as the internet of things and fifth-generation networks are introduced in the region, exponentially larger volumes of data will be generated, and companies can profit from them even more. </p><p>As holder of ASEAN rotating chair for 2019, Thailand has prioritized Industry 4.0, cultivating digital talent, and digitizing small businesses as part of its agenda. It is well-placed to begin the conversation on data governance. ASEAN must ask big questions about tech and establish principles for creating trust among consumers, business and tech. Following the proven success of ASEAN's consensus approach, lawmakers should boost the synergies between government, businesses and consumers, without favoring any party at the expense of others. </p><p>Chen Chen Lee is Director of Policy Programs, and Erin Low is Policy Research Analyst (ASEAN) at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NIKKEI-RSI068170712032019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NIKKEI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-DDP1-DYBD-M18H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1173\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Nikkei Asian Review (Japan)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Facebook emails were obtained in a legal process in the US by Six4Three, a company suing Facebook. Last November the UK parliament seized the documents from an executive of the company in London. One record relates to Mr Kenny and claims that the former taoiseach offered to use the \"significant influence\" of Ireland's EU presidency to press other member states \"even though technically Ireland is supposed to remain neutral\", according to reports in The Observer and Computer Weekly.</p><p>Yesterday Leo Varadkar said that his predecessor had no case to answer but European politicians have expressed concern at the suggestions about Ireland's relationship with Facebook.</p><p>Mr Varadkar said: \"We don't have a relationship with Facebook that is any closer than the relationship with any large firm that invests here and creates employment here.\"</p><p>Mr Kenny has yet to comment on the contents of the documents and Mr Varadkar said that this was Mr Kenny's own decision.</p><p>Mr Ryan said that Irish politicians needed to see sections that related to Mr Kenny and any other relevant parties. He said that it was clear from the internal documents and previous public remarks by Facebook staff that there was a view in the company that Ireland was working for them in Europe.</p><p>He said that a speech by Marne Levine, who was global head of policy, at the Institute of International and European Affairs in 2013 was evidence of this perception. Ms Levine congratulated Ireland on \"its great leadership in shepherding the legislation so far in the European Council \" and noted that a representative of Mr Kenny's office was in the audience.</p><p>Leftwing groupings in the European parliament also said that there were questions to answer about the reports.</p><p>A spokesman for the European United Left/Nordic Green Left grouping, which includes Sinn F\u00e9in and Luke Flanagan, said that it was \"extremely concerned\" that the internal Facebook memo indicated that Ireland was willing to use the EU presidency to lobby for the company.</p><p>\"Corporate influence over EU institutions needs to be properly tackled and regulated so that those bodies work for people, rather than big tech companies or any other private business interests,\" the spokesman said. \"In particular the rules around data protection at the European level must be fully safeguarded from aggressive lobbying campaigns by big tech companies in Brussels to ensure that they are of the highest standard and worthy of the trust of citizens and users.\"</p><p>Birgit Sippel, a German MEP from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, which includes the Irish Labour Party, said that the type of lobbying suggested by the Facebook memo fit with the company's wider lobbying campaign in Europe.</p><p>\"The story on how Ireland and other member states worked to shield Facebook from stronger rules is sadly all too common. The same thing is happening now with national governments blocking a strong e-privacy regulation in council,\" Ms Sippel said.</p><p>Lucinda Creighton, the minister for European affairs from 2011 to 2013 and now a columnist for The Times, rejected any suggestion that Ireland was lobbying on behalf of Facebook when it held the presidency. \"Engaging with industry is very useful and necessary for lawmakers.

Juniper warned on June 8; Intel stuck to its numbers in a June 7 midquarter update; Broadcom warned June 6.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the other shoe about to drop on tech stocks?<br/> The last two months have seen computer and telecom shares rally sharply, as the Fed kept cutting interest rates and the economy stabilized. But market observers agree that most companies are still seeing much slower business than they would like. In fact, despite investors' recent enthusiasm, there's no sign that the slowdown will lift anytime soon: Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq), for instance, warned last week in a regulatory filing that it sees no sign of a pickup in telecom spending.<br/>With the second quarter more than two-thirds done and earnings season just a month away, analysts and investors say many of the big names in tech remain at risk. In every tech industry, from PCs to networking to wireless communications, big companies have cut their earnings and revenue expectations -- but perhaps not enough. With this in mind, TheStreet.com presents a sector-by-sector look at some of the big tech companies and their prospects for this quarter.</p><p>The Boxxies\u00a0</p><p>PC makers remain at high risk across the board, as nearly every new data point confirms that demand remains extremely weak, and may even be worsening. The price of standard 128-megabit DRAM memory continues to collapse, lately scraping below $3 on the spot market. After a brief uptick in February and March, Taiwan shipments of PC motherboards have softened again. Gateway's (GTW:NYSE) decision Wednesday to match any competitor on pricing will depress everyone's profit margins -- this in an industry where the only company to make a profit on PCs last quarter was Dell (DELL:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>All this could put Compaq's (CPQ:NYSE) numbers at particular risk. Compaq generally has shown itself more aggressive on pricing than Hewlett-Packard (HWP:NYSE) and has a PC business second in size only to Dell. More worrisome still are reports of rising retail channel inventories, which have doubled from their level in February, according to market research firm NPD Intellect. That has serious implications for Compaq, which sees the reduction of inventory held by its reseller partners as critical to the company's plan to lower its cost structure enough to compete with Dell.\u00a0</p><p>Although the stock is down 20% from its April high, the probability of another warning may not yet be fully reflected in Compaq's shares, which still trade at nearly 30 times the company's estimated earnings for 2001.\u00a0</p><p>You might not think that Dell would be a strong candidate for warning. After all, it's the strongest of the PC makers, and lowered guidance for its third quarter just two weeks ago. But things have changed since then. Gateway's newly aggressive campaign has forced Dell, which up to this point has mainly been engaged mano a mano with Compaq, into a two-front price war. Dell, of course, has a leaner cost-structure than any of its competitors. Emboldened by its business model, Dell will fight Gateway as aggressively as it's fought Compaq. Chances are good that the company will have trouble making its second-quarter earnings forecast and/or will be forced to lower third-quarter guidance.\u00a0</p><p>In the short term, a warning is probably priced into Dell. It's unlikely that another shortfall will spark a serious selloff among Dell's investors, who will remain dogged in their conviction that the company's leadership position supports its valuation even as profit margins continue to nosedive.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Telecom Gear\u00a0</p><p>As one investor put it: Show me a company that's counting on spending by cash-starved telcos, and I'll show you a company at risk to fall short of earnings estimates.\u00a0</p><p>Juniper (JNPR:Nasdaq) is one of the more likely networking preannouncers, analysts say. Juniper repeated to investors two weeks ago what it had outlined during its April earnings call, that there was a 10% risk that the company wouldn't match its first-quarter sales performance.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"608\"><tgroup cols=\"5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"3\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"4\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"5\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"5\" namest=\"1\">Warning Signs?

But the 10% uncertainty has haunted the stock lately, as the share price fell 20% last week.\u00a0</p><p>Should the router challenger, which has consistently swiped business from Cisco, warn that profits will come in below the 24 cents per share Wall Street is expecting, some analysts believe the stock will fall somewhere in the $30 range from the current low $40 range.\u00a0</p><p>And further down the line of network gear suppliers, the formerly highflying optical component maker JDS Uniphase (JDSU:Nasdaq) has yet to fully adjust for the network industry's current down phase, say some of Wall Street's number crunchers. JDS is voted the most likely member of its class to warn, though Corning (GLW:NYSE) and Lucent's component spinoff Agere (AGR:NYSE) are under the same pressure.\u00a0</p><p>Industrywide capital spending -- the money phone and Internet companies shell out for new switches, routers and optical parts for network construction -- is likely to fall 10% this year. That means there will be roughly $7 billion less flowing down from the big spenders to the gearmakers. Add to that a vicious price war fueled by surplus supply, and you have a double whammy on outfits like JDS.\u00a0</p><p>You had operating leverage on the upside in terms of production capacity, which in this downside has turned into a burden of high fixed costs, says a Boston-based buy-side analyst. \"This is more than just an economic cycle issue, it's an industry investment cycle problem for the telecom equipment providers,\" says the analyst, who has no positions in Juniper or JDS.\u00a0</p><p>In the event JDS does warn that it won't hit its 5-cent EPS target for the quarter, JDS shares would likely fall to the $12 range from the current $17, says a sell-side analyst who asked not to be named. \"A warning would be a catalyst to take the stock lower,\" says the analyst. \"The group trades at about four or five times 2002 projected sales. If you apply that to JDSU, you end up with a $12 stock.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Chipmakers\u00a0</p><p>Analysts are expecting bad news from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq) Thursday, when it is scheduled to provide a midquarter financial update to investors. Intel has cut revenue guidance at midquarter in each of the last three quarters. Based on Intel's guidance, analysts expect $6.5 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Analysts also see 11 cents in earnings per share for the second quarter and 55 cents for the year. Intel typically doesn't offer earnings guidance, however.\u00a0</p><p>Lehman Brothers' Dan Niles said on Wednesday during the Silicon Valley-based Churchill Club's annual semiconductor forecast that there's no reason to buy Intel stock, because a warning is coming. \"I believe Intel will lower its guidance again,\" Niles said. Earlier that day, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Mark Edelstone also said in a research note he expected Intel to cut guidance. Intel said on April 17 when it announced first-quarter earnings that it expected revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. (Neither bank has done underwriting for Intel.)\u00a0</p><p>Another semiconductor company that Edelstone says could come up short in the second quarter is communications chip maker Broadcom (BRCM:Nasdaq). Broadcom has no midquarter update scheduled, but the company has been known to issue warnings. For instance, Broadcom came out during the first week of the last month of the first quarter to guide estimates lower as telecommunications spending slowed and inventories built. Currently, analysts expect Broadcom to lose 8 cents a share in the second quarter and lose 2 cents a share for the year. Broadcom said in April when it reported first-quarter earnings that it expects a loss of 7 to 9 cents a share for the second quarter. Morgan has done underwriting for Broadcom.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Advertising\u00a0</p><p>There's not a lot of good news circulating in the online advertising business. With ad rates dropping, pricing pressure is coming to bear on DoubleClick's (DCLK:Nasdaq) ad-serving product, says one analyst. The larger economic slowdown pressures both its data business and online media sales. But the company has already brought down the bar somewhat, lowering its second-quarter revenue estimate to a range of $100 million to $105 million (Thomson Financial/First Call puts the consensus at $105 million), following first-quarter actual revenue of $114.9 million. \"They might miss earnings by 5%,\" says an analyst who requested anonymity. \"It's not going to be 30%\"\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, TMP Worldwide's (TMPW:Nasdaq) Internet recruiting business, anchored by its Monster.com service, bucked the trend by showing strong year-over-year growth, with Internet commissions and fees more than doubling to $156.6 million in the first quarter. But, said Chief Operating Officer Jim Treacy in the first-quarter earnings release, \"We are feeling the impact of an economic slowdown in the U.S.\" The slowdown has already hit traditional lines of business such as advertising/communications and executive search, though to a degree much outweighed by the positives on the Internet side. The questions are now whether the weakening job market will hit the Internet business, too, or significantly worsen the non-Internet businesses. The company, which has no shortage of enthusiastic fans, has seen its stock nearly double since early April.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Wireless\u00a0</p><p>Motorola (MOT:NYSE) and Ericsson (ERICY:Nasdaq ADR) have brought the bar down about as far as it will go. Motorola forecast that its second quarter would show a wider loss than its historic money-losing first quarter. For its part, Ericsson predicted weaker equipment sales growth and flagging wireless handset sales against a year ago.\u00a0</p><p>That said, both wireless communications giants are faced with a continuing handset-sales slowdown that could leave their numbers well short of analysts' expectations. Analysts expect a 12-cent loss for Motorola, narrowly eclipsing the first quarter's 90-cent loss, on $8 billion in revenue, according to Multex.com. Ericsson is expected to turn in a 5-cent-a-share loss on revenue of $6 billion, vs. the first quarter's 3-cent loss and $5.4 billion in revenue.\u00a0</p><p>After a bleak first quarter, the second quarter hasn't gotten much better. In the past two weeks, several analysts have reduced their expectations for 2001 handset sales, to 450 million from the 650 million predicted months ago. Additionally, Ericsson fell this week after the Gartner Group predicted Ericsson would tumble from the ranks of the top three handset makers. \"It's like if a guy lost 10 pounds,\" says Morningstar analyst Todd Bernier. \"If he weighs 480 pounds, that's not a big dent. But if he weighs 90 pounds, it's not good.\u00a0</p><p>\"Ericsson is registering no EKG in terms of handsets,\" Bernier says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1448081#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:437D-W2P0-00MP-T3KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1905\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2001 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>June 8, 2001 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0HP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0BROADCOM CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0HPQ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0BRCM (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0INTC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0SIC3663 RADIO &amp;

Donald Trump, via Twitter, is waging war on multiple fronts. In addition to comments on China, Trump holds Iran responsible for the recent attacks on the oilfields in Saudi Arabia and is embroiled in numerous spats with the Democratic candidates as they prepare for next year's presidential election. This has coincided with the initiation of an impeachment inquiry into him. Outside of the US the UK's efforts to leave the European Union took a further knock with the Supreme Court ruling that Boris Johnson's decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful. With the departure date again deferred at the end of October the outcome looks uncertain and the possibility of a policy mistake is high.</p><p><br/>   Relating this back to markets, whilst the overall equity market performance was strong for the half this largely reflected the strength of the US market, which rose by 11.6% over the period. Other markets were more challenged. Emerging markets, reflecting their sensitivity to the trade war, lagged with a return of 1.8%, with China down some -3.3% and India 0.8%. Europe continued to underperform, rising 8.5% in H1, and the UK lagged at 4.0%.<br/>   Bond markets performed somewhat better. The combination of their defensive nature and interest rate cuts in both Europe and the US saw stronger prices across the board. Despite a significant proportion of global government bonds yielding less than zero, yields continue to fall, boosting the returns of US Treasuries which rose by 11.5%, while global investment grade was up 11.2% and UK index-linked bonds were up 9.8%.<br/>   Commodities experienced more contrasting fortunes. Gold, being a more defensive asset class, typically performing better when interest rates are low and falling, rose by 20.5%. Oil prices, despite strengthening in September following the attack on the Saudi field, actually fell for the half as a whole, reflecting lower global demand due to the softening economic backdrop.<br/>   Warning flags?<br/>   Normally we dedicate the second half of our Hansa House View to a particular theme. This time we thought we would do something different and mull over a number of key issues currently challenging markets. Largely these are standalone in nature with a notable exception, they all tend to be mean reverting and are often features of market tops. The issues we will cover are:<br/>   Inverted yield curves: Precursor to recession?<br/>   Value vs growth: Will value investing reassert itself?<br/>   Peak margins: A mean reverting factor?<br/>   Peak valuations: Time to sell?<br/>   Inverted yield curves: Precursor to recession?<br/>   One of the best predictors of recession historically has been that of an inverted yield curve. With the shorter end of the bond yield curve higher than the longer end, rather than the more normal upward sloping curve, the market is effectively indicating that future growth rates will be poor. Its success rate as a signal has been exceptional. Indeed if we look back over the last 60 years we find that the US yield curve has inverted prior to seven recessions.<br/>   So why then with the curve inverting earlier this year are we not running for the hills (and are we in danger of falling into the age old trap of believing it will be different this time)?<br/>   Well, first-off, on closer inspection we find that whilst the predictive power of an inverted yield curve may be good, its timing is less precise. Often the lag between the point of inversion and recession is a number of years, with three of the last ten instances not seeing a recession within two years. With the final stages of a bull market typically generating some of the strongest returns in a cycle, exiting equities at the point of inversion can prove extremely expensive.<br/>   Perhaps even more important in our eyes, and why we think the messaging power of the yield curve is currently diminished, is just how exceptional the interest rate and yield curve backdrop currently is. In more normal times using the yield curve to predict recession is entirely logical. Typically towards the end of a stock market and economic cycle animal spirits are running high, capacity within the system is tight and inflation is starting to rear its ugly head. Central banks are then forced to step in, ratcheting up interest rates, pushing the short end of the curve upwards. Unfortunately central bankers tend to overshoot, raising rates too aggressively which catalyses the next recession. Bond markets, being predictive in nature, anticipate this course of events forcing the long end of the yield curve down as the short end rises. Hence the inverted yield curve and why it has been an excellent predictor of a looming recession.<br/>   This time round things couldn't be more different. Post the Global Financial Crisis central banks were forced to step in and introduce exceptional monetary measures to counteract a potential collapse in the global banking system and economic depression. To a large degree these policy measures worked, saving the banking system (although the European banking system is still not out of the woods) and boosting economies. Unfortunately, like an addict, the system has become hooked on this medicine of ever lower rates and greater liquidity, to the point where its effectiveness is deteriorating. Our view is that the point has been reached where it is not a question of the supply of liquidity but rather an absence of demand for liquidity. Whether interest rates are 0.5%, 0% or, indeed, negative has limited impact on a company's or consumer's desire to borrow. Rather it is a question of subdued confidence that is preventing economies from achieving more normal levels of growth. Hence although the curve is inverted it is not due to short rates being high but rather long rates being exceptionally low.<br/>   Furthermore, it increasingly looks like this diet of ever lower rates may even be killing the patient. Unlike in more normal monetary conditions when higher interest rates lead to poor companies failing and capital being reallocated towards more efficient enterprises, the current low/negative rate environment has enabled these zombie companies to survive and stymied the normal, healthy Darwinian function of markets. This distorted backdrop has also impacted the banking sector, which is key to a healthy economy with inverted yield curves hindering the natural carry present from borrowing at cheaper short rates and lending at higher long rates.<br/>   Hence, we would argue that whilst certainly not ignoring the fact the yield curve is inverted, we would be less confident of its effectiveness as a messaging tool given the distortions present within the system. Indeed, we would go on to argue that now is the time to stop relying solely on monetary easing and instead look to other measures such as fiscal policy to take up the baton on kick-starting global economies from their current malaise.<br/>   Value vs growth: Will value investing reassert itself?<br/>   Through time one of the most successful investment strategies has been value investing. Reflecting investors' behavioural biases, the success of value investing lies in the ability to buy companies below their intrinsic value. Where companies have been oversold investors have wrongly extrapolated bad news ad infinitum. Extolled by such investment legends as Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham, value investing has long proved its worth.<br/>   This cycle however has been characterised by growth outperforming value and significantly so in many cases. In the US the outperformance gap has been 96% and in Europe it has been even greater at 119%.<br/>   We believe there are two factors behind this underperformance of value versus growth. Firstly, it is due to the success of growth. Technology, which dominates the growth sector, has benefitted from many nascent technologies combining to create a network effect as companies such as Amazon utilised the internet to dominate retailing in a winner-takes-all strategy. This has been reinforced by capital being readily available to fund this growth and investors being prepared to value these future cash flows much more highly, as they applied lower discount rates to profits that are often not expected to occur for a number of years.<br/>   The second factor reflects the structural challenges faced by many value companies and sectors. The flip side to the success of the technology sector is that many incumbents have failed to adapt to the new competitive environment, sticking with business models that are increasingly outdated and expensive to maintain. Retailers have persisted with high street stores as shoppers shift to online shopping, banks maintain their costly branch networks in the face of online banking and the oil &amp; gas sector has failed to shift rapidly enough from carbon fuels as consumers move to more sustainable forms of energy.<br/>   Naturally this raises the question as to when the tide will turn back in value's favour with many commentators arguing it is a question of when, not if, value reasserts itself. The problem we have is when we look at the fundamentals it is harder to make this argument with conviction. When assessing the outlook for many of the big growth names such as Microsoft, Apple and Facebook we find many of them look fairly valued versus their growth prospects. Potentially a radical shift in the regulation or taxation of some of the big tech names could be a catalyst for lower returns, but for now many appear to have created natural monopolies.<br/>   Likewise when we look at the constituents of the value sector they appear to be dominated by a number of ex-growth industries. As highlighted above, banks, retailers and oil &amp; gas sectors dominate the value index and it is hard to make strong investment cases for many of these, certainly at current interest rates. Our view is there will come a time when value comes back into favour, since the behavioural characteristics of humans inevitably lead to sectors and companies becoming oversold, but it may not be for some time and it will probably be linked to a shift from the current low interest rate environment.<br/>   Peak margins: A mean reverting factor?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-59794842212RN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRC-RJ11-JCXB-252D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1693\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Listen to the daughter of one victim described the aftermath of that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has a fractured skull. He has been sliced, like through his neck. He has a shattered arm. The doctors do not have high hopes for him. He may never be -- I mean, if he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Awful. So far the coverage of the attack in Monsey has focused on the rising number of violent anti-Jewish incidents in New York and across the country, as well as on Thomas's own psychiatric issues which were significant.</p><p>But we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology. Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York.</p><p>By the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal.</p><p>Now, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail.</p><p>In other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning. The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.</p><p>Bernard Kerik was once the New York City Police Commissioner and he joins us tonight. Bernie, thanks so much for coming on. How did this happen?</p><p>BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well listen, I've been, you know, talking about this for the last year where I think the city, the State of New York is irresponsible in creating these laws where they're not holding people accountable.</p><p>On January 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that Rape 3 -- Rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. And people aren't held when they get locked up.</p><p>They're just turning them around right through a turnstile. I think it's - - this is a demonstration of how the city is going to implode if they don't fix it and fix it fast because you're going to continue to have people like this out on the streets.</p><p>CARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?</p><p>KERIK: Well, I think it's this left wing liberal socialist push, where we villainize the police. We embolden the criminals. We let people out. You know, there was the criminal justice reform push.</p><p>You know, here's the bottom line. There should be criminal justice reform. Bbad people that do bad things belong in prison.</p><p>We put Rod Blagojevich, the Governor of Illinois in prison for 14 years for talking about politics on the phone.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree.</p><p>KERIK: But you have people committing getting violent acts, violent acts against others, and they turn around and let them out to go out and do it again the next day, and the next day after.</p><p>You've had -- you had a woman who committed three acts of violence in three days, and she's been let out every day after.</p><p>CARLSON: So you started on the New York City force, at the Police Department when New York was dangerous. You took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction. It almost seems like we know what to do to make the city safe, but we're not doing it on purpose.</p><p>KERIK: You know what, Tucker? Nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than I did, and I do because I was there when the Renaissance occurred, but it looks like this Mayor and this Governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.</p><p>And what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.</p><p>CARLSON: It just shows you what political leaders can do the damage they can wreak. I mean, all of our attention is on the national stage. But here you have just a Mayor, just as Mayor of a city, causing remarkable damage to people.</p><p>KERIK: Well, listen, all you have to do is look what's happened in the last week, in the last 24 hours. This thing should be reversed. The Mayor should be screaming out of his mind to get it reversed.</p><p>He's not out there. He's not doing it. It endangers the public. It's irresponsible. It's dangerous to the police officers to put their lives on the line on a daily basis to go out and arrest people. It's a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: It's depressing. Bernie Kerik, thanks so much for that.</p><p>As you just heard, New York City appears to be doing everything that it can to create more Grafton Thomas's. A New Year's Day new bail laws went into effect in New York State. Those aren't going to help.</p><p>Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.</p><p>In the words of Governor Andrew Cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested.</p><p>Habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.</p><p>Who benefits from this? It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail.</p><p>Last week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn. Harris was arrested, charged and released. On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again.</p><p>On New Year's Eve, guess what she did? She got arrested for a third time. This time she is finally being kept in custody. That's New York.</p><p>But Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): I have been a leader in the United States Senate on saying we need to get rid of the cash bail system.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're in jail because they are too poor to afford cash bail. You understand what I'm saying? We're going to end cash bail.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): We should get rid of cash bail entirely.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How about we stop making poverty a crime? No more cash bail. This is crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Is this what the country wants or needs? Is this a peaceful place where law-abiding citizens feel safe and protected and ought to be, increasingly it's not.</p><p>For about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, \"over policed neighborhoods,\" whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.</p><p>Now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent. The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.</p><p>We have the numbers. Here's what they are. In Philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of Soros funded DA, Larry Krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year. That's the most in more than a decade.</p><p>In other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia. Baltimore had 348 murders last year. That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore.</p><p>In 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks. The murder rate went up to over 200.</p><p>In Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57. This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going. The city finished with 108 murders on the year. That's the most since the early 1990s.</p><p>How about Washington, the nation's capital? Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders. Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders. See a trend? You should because it's everywhere.</p><p>We could spend half the show resetting the stats for city after city -- St. Louis, Raleigh, Seattle, Louisville, Cincinnati -- we could go on and on.</p><p>The point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago. This is happening. These are not fake statistics. They're the most real.</p><p>And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.</p><p>San Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers. We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.</p><p>The bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform. They want criminal justice enforcement. They've always wanted that. So why aren't they getting it?</p><p>Heather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question. She is the author of the book, \"The Diversity Delusion,\" a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight. Heather, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So I don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. Why is this complicated for our leaders?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Because they're in the grips of a false narrative, which says that the criminal justice system is racist. This massive wave of de- incarceration, decriminalization that is going on across the country as you point out, Tucker, is being done in the name of racial justice.</p><p>Well, guess who those homicide victims are overwhelmingly? Black.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Law-abiding blacks. The criminal justice system, Tucker, is not racist. The incidence of people in prison is because of crime, not their skin color.</p><p>Prison today remains a Lifetime Achievement Award for persistence in criminal offending. You have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that America's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. That is simply not the case.</p><p>CARLSON: I can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, Roger Stone is facing life in prison for what? It's not even clear.</p><p>So the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. But again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. They never have been for it. So how do our leaders get away with it?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. Again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about America today is defined and created by racism. And I guess, the public does not have a voice.</p><p>But we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. Right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me ask a quick question. So when Bernie Sanders or someone like him stands up and says, the only reason these people are in jail is because they're poor, just like demonstrably false.</p><p>I've never heard a Republican candidate or any Republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. We have the numbers, you're wrong. Why do they never stand up for simple law and order?</p><p>MAC DONALD: They're scared. I mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. I was at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. I was very disappointed in the Republicans. They just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.</p><p>As for this idea that cash bail affects the poor. Listen, in New York City, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them. And that's because they have long felony arrest records and only 0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.</p><p>In fact, most people are put on the streets anyway. And so this bail reform law is a solution in search of a non-problem that is only going to create more crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, exactly. There you go with your statistics and those spooky numbers. We appreciate it though. Heather Mac Donald, thank you so much.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Another Democrat dropped out of the presidential race, and once again, the press is distressed by this. They are calling Democratic primary voters bigots for not supporting him, are they?</p><p>Plus, Joe Biden says putting coal miners out of work is no big deal. They should just learn to code. Can they? That's next. Amazing.</p><p>CARLSON: There's an awful lot of news tonight, but we want to pause and acknowledge something that's happened in the Democratic presidential race. Julian Castro is out.</p><p>In other words, until this morning, he was still running for President. You'd be forgiven if you assume that he dropped out months ago. That's how effective his candidacy was.</p><p>The only time he got any attention was at the first Democratic debate, you might remember. It was back in June, where he addressed the pressing problem, one of the biggest problems this country faces, how do biological men get abortions? He had an answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. You know, what that means is that just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female who is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. His other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity. The video announcing the end of his candidacy opened and closed with a line in Spanish, which basically said it all, vote for me because of my background and because I speak Spanish.</p><p>The irony, though, is that Julian Castro actually can't speak Spanish. He is just totally fraudulent. Now, there's nothing wrong with not being able to speak Spanish. Actually, that's not a crime.</p><p>In fact, if anything, Castro could have celebrated that is proof that immigrants assimilate into American study as they have for hundreds of years. That's a good thing. We used to be for that.</p><p>But the vision of actual assimilation has no currency in the modern Democratic Party, where people are constantly divided up by skin color, nationality, gender and language.</p><p>So instead, he had to play up his views on immigration, which honestly, were kind of extreme. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASTRO: Instead of building a wall or closing the border, we should choose compassion instead of cruelty.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. How do you think?</p><p>CASTRO: You know, I don't believe their narrative. I don't believe the BS.</p><p>We should decriminalize people who are coming here, crossing the border.</p><p>We need to increase the number of refugees that we take into this country.</p><p>And if we're not careful, if we don't get this right, in 20 or 30 years, this nation is going to be begging for immigrants to come to this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Begging -- and if you're not, you're not grateful. You're a bad person.</p><p>Well, as we said, he is out of the race and over on MSNBC, they're taking it hard. Some of the anchors pointed to Castro's departure. It's just the latest evidence that the Democratic primary electorate is racist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julian Castro, the only thing Latino running ends his campaign today leaving the Democrats even less diverse. Following the earlier departure, of course of Senator Kamala Harris.</p><p>As of now, there are going to be five white candidates on this next debate stage. Is that sustainable for the Democratic Party?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: David Perino is the first person we go to, to figure out what's going on in this race. She hosts \"The Daily Briefing,\" of course with Dana Perino. We're always grateful to have her.</p><p>So Dana, you keep hearing from Democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, I guess, Biden and Bernie, what do you make of that?</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: And then I wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.</p><p>And the thing about Julio Castro is that he gave the D.N.C. Convention speech back in 2012 and he became the candidate of tomorrow, but he was a candidate of tomorrow for so long that it became yesterday.</p><p>He never was able to get a foothold. And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.</p><p>If you think of someone like Elizabeth Warren and Medicare-for-All, that got the full treatment, but Julian Castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee? I think that he will, though, be on the VP shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.</p><p>But I don't know if they'll actually choose him because there's many other people that show that they were able to get some base of support.</p><p>CARLSON: You make such a smart point. I mean, if I get up and said, you know, if a biological man gets pregnant, I promise I'll pay for his abortion. I'd be laughed at and I'd probably lose my job, right?</p><p>But he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. You know, whatever. I just want to ask you --</p><p>PERINO: That's when you know you're in real trouble. If you say something like that and like -- it's like if a tree falls in a forest, like if you say something like that on a debate stage and everyone goes, yes, well, it's just like helium. Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, you could just be floridly and say that and nobody cares. So this happened in New Hampshire on Monday. Joe Biden explained how coal miners should adapt to having their jobs regulated out of existence. They should just learn a completely different profession from scratch. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I come from a family -- we're in an area where there is coal mining in Scranton. Anybody who could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So this just -- this struck me as so very similar to a line that we heard not very long ago, basically dismissing the concerns of people whose industries, particularly the coal business has been regulated out of existence. Is that a wise thing even for a Democrats to say right now?</p><p>PERINO: So you're saying I think you're talking about the Hillary Clinton comment in the 2016 campaign.</p><p>CARLSON: I am. That's right.</p><p>PERINO: In which basically she was like celebrating the fact that they were going to try to put coal out of business, and then she had the deplorables line and she never really came back from that.</p><p>I think the thing about Joe Biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, Joe means well. Okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. He cares about us -- like, he has that.</p><p>But there is an elitist attitude about coal that it belies the entire Democratic Party. The truth is, if he wants to win, he is going to have to try to win back some of those workers ion the rust belt, including coal workers.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: And I think that what he could have done, since apparently America is in a mood to wildly spend on government programs, why not try to ratchet it up and I would -- he could have said something like, I'm going to commit $15 billion for this community, specifically to help them, make sure that they're taken care of et cetera.</p><p>Now, one thing that happened last week, the taxpayers are going to bail out a lot of the coal pensions because they were mismanaged by the executives, not the workers, but by the executives and guess then who gets on the hook for that? The taxpayers.</p><p>And Joe Biden doesn't do any of that. He bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which I think will come back to haunt him.</p><p>CARLSON: So I just wonder quickly, I mean, that kind of tells you a lot about how that community is viewed in the Democratic Party. I mean, is it that hard if you're promising, you know, everybody a chunk of cash, just to say that, you know, Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and West Virginia, here's some -- but they can't because they don't like those people.</p><p>PERINO: I think that it's showing that you have some -- I mean, think about Bill Clinton, right? I feel your pain. He didn't really, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: But people thought that he meant it when he said that. Joe Biden has the capability to be that kind of guy as well. But what he said the other night was much more in line with sort of the fundraising circuit for Democrats, not the people circuit.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Mistake. Dana Perino, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: Okay. Happy New Year.</p><p>CARLSON: Happy New Year. So you were celebrating this past week with your family, but permanent Washington was plotting yet another war in the Middle East.</p><p>Tonight, there seems to have been another big step toward that war. We will be asking a question nobody seems to be raising. Is it a good idea? An update and what's happening tonight after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: We have an unexpected Fox News alert for you, something that has just happened in Iraq. The situation there, heating up very quickly without any debate here in Washington.</p><p>Iraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Commander of the Quds Force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the Baghdad airport, along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia. Now, what were they doing in Iraq? Unclear.</p><p>But his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country. Last week, if you've been following this, you know, an American civilian contractor was killed by militants in Iraq. The U.S. government blamed that attack on Iran and it retaliated with strikes.</p><p>In response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It's basically where we were when the show started tonight.</p><p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.</p><p>Now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war. And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.</p><p>For example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish. Should you be happy about that? That's the question.</p><p>Well, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice. Why? Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington.</p><p>In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south. The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.</p><p>Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. The real threat is Iran. Well, they're liars. And they don't care about you. They don't care about your kids. They are reckless and incompetent. And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.</p><p>Curt Mills is a senior writer at the \"American Conservative.\" He joins us now. So Curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak. Where could it go from here?</p><p>CURT MILLS, SENIOR WRITER, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE: Well, like you said, if you liked the Iraq War, Tucker, we're back with a sequel, the Iran War.</p><p>I would say the deep concern is, look, a general in the Iranian forces being assassinated is not necessarily something to mourn or begrudge the U.S. getting involved in.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right. I agree.</p><p>MILLS: The question is, though, is this a Franz Ferdinand moment? Is this a situation where a great power gets involved with the middle tier power and gets the world into a world war?</p><p>Iran, I think is a problem for the U.S. and its allies in the region. But it is not an existential threat, like China or Russia. China or Russia, particularly China would love to see another decade or two of Americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's exactly it. It's not that anyone I think in the United States has particular affection for Iran or trust in its government, much, much less the Revolutionary Guard or the Kurds forces. Of course not.</p><p>But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.</p><p>MILLS: It's a joke. It's a joke. I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? So you see the Baghdad embassy protests. And to be clear, this is not just an embassy. This is a fortress. It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.</p><p>They're just -- they're sent there. So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy. The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq?</p><p>I understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq? But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq. We're talking about Iraq, 16 years later, it's still Iraq.</p><p>In order to counter Iran, I think the choice is clear. The President should contain Iranian influence in the region. We should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs.</p><p>CARLSON: So my sense of it is, the President doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but I think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary.</p><p>But there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants.</p><p>MILLS: Right. So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.</p><p>I know, Bolton is a bugbear for you. But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C. O'Brien, Bolton's successor might actually be more effective at Trojan horsing, what I think would be a tragedy in the Middle East.</p><p>Iran is not Iraq, it's twice as big. It'd be twice as bad. We're weaker than we were 16 years ago. If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's right. Curt Mills. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>MILLS: Thanks. So you hear a lot from the left about how concerned about the environment they are. But you've noticed that those concerns have always conveniently dovetailed with acquiring more political power and crushing their political enemies.</p><p>California saw major wildfires this year and according to the \"Nation\" magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem. And we're quoting now, \"The idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. Individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.\"</p><p>Banning private homeownership? Will that stop wildfires? It would fix the environment. How about building fewer shopping malls? No one ever thinks of that. No, it won't. It will make the government more powerful. It'll make regular people less happy and less free. And of course, that is the point.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a lifelong Californian. He is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and we're happy to have him tonight. Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. Do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, it's a characteristic of the left that they envision natural and man-made disasters as opportunities to ram down agendas that we otherwise wouldn't vote for, and that's what Rahm Emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste.</p><p>I think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines. This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker.</p><p>We've only gone up about one degree in a century in California. That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.</p><p>We never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&amp;E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States. It's ossified. It's calcified. It's over regulated. It's got all these green mandates. It's got to use expensive energy production.</p><p>It doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.</p><p>And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.</p><p>And when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places. The freeways are packed. We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983. So it's a kind of a perfect storm.</p><p>And you know, Tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at San Francisco Airport. We can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I mean, it's dysfunctional because it's crowded, and it's crowded because of their immigration policy and they won't admit that. They did this, as you know. Professor, thank you so much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So attacking homeowners is just one facet of the broader assault on normal people in this country. In the City of San Francisco, progressives are working constantly to create their ideal vision of an American city.</p><p>But the opposite has been the effect. It is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. It's a dystopia in a lot of ways. The most beautiful city in our country.</p><p>We sent a team of producers to San Francisco for an in-depth exclusive investigation into what is happening there. And the effect it is having on the dwindling pool of middle class residents.</p><p>Our special series debuts next Monday, and it continues all week. Here's a short preview of what we found.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, it's -- even the trailer is all too much. It's shocking what we found.</p><p>Well, up next, free speech may be dying in parts of America, but Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager are ensuring the First Amendment would at least go down fighting.</p><p>Their documentary is back in theaters and they join us next to talk about it. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Freedom of speech is America's most distinctive, right. It's a free country. Remember they used to say that back when it was. But it's also the most embattled of all of our rights.</p><p>In the name of safety and sensitivity, a coalition of big tech monopolists, universities and political activists are fighting to limit what you're allowed to say, and punish those who stray outside the accepted boundaries.</p><p>But last year, comedian Adam Carolla who is a genius, and radio host, Dennis Prager, also kind of genius, teamed up to release \"No Safe Spaces,\" kind of a brilliant documentary about the American Anti-Speech Movement. Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS PRAGER, FOUNDER, PRAGER U: Israel sent me into the Soviet Union when I was 21 years old, because I knew Russian and Hebrew, and I was sent in to smuggle out the names of Jews that I would find in the Soviet Union and to smuggle in religious items and so on.</p><p>And I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's a great movie. And if you want to see it in theaters, you still have a chance to do that. The film is having a limited release this weekend, thanks to strong support from grateful viewers.</p><p>Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager, join us tonight. Gentlemen, thanks both for coming out. I haven't talked to you since the film came out. Just to start with you, Adam. What was the risk? Did anyone tell you that you're not allowed to say the things you said in the film? Did the irony loop come complete?</p><p>ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN: It is interesting when people are talking about free speech, but it's free speech that they want to vet and make sure it's okay for them to hear before you can say it.</p><p>I did notice the clip was all Dennis Prager, by the way, so I'm going to get my publicist on this.</p><p>PRAGER: Yes. This resentment is a very big problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think he may be close to one of my producers.</p><p>PRAGER: The problem is -- it's a big problem. We enjoy each other too much. We're looking for problems.</p><p>CAROLLA: Yes. We're still kind of in the newly wed phase of our relationship.</p><p>CARLSON: So what are -- but even newlyweds, they may sublimate it, but there's usually tension. If you could identify one thing that divides you bitterly, what would it be?</p><p>CAROLLA: He likes gefilte fish, and I wouldn't feed that stuff to my cat.</p><p>PRAGER: No, you said you did feed it.</p><p>CAROLLA: Yes, I did. Feed it to my cat.</p><p>PRAGER: Your cat liked it. I asked you specifically how it went over in the Corolla home. You said the cat loved it.</p><p>CAROLLA: Yes, he gave me a jar of gefilte fish.</p><p>PRAGER: Yes, I did.</p><p>CAROLLA: By the way fish isn't supposed to be in jars. Just for your information. It should be on platters or it's supposed to be above a fireplace in a hunting lodge. Your aquarium. That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PRAGER: By the way, this was the danger working with him.</p><p>CARLSON: So has the problem gotten better?</p><p>PRAGER: No.</p><p>CAROLLA: The gefilte fish is as bad as it has ever been.</p><p>CARLSON: No, that's -- I mean, I think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. But the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?</p><p>PRAGER: No, it's -- it is less free. There's no question. And you could -- there's an interesting proof. Read the reviewers in the mainstream media, not to mention left wing media, on how they have contempt for the film.</p><p>When the film features liberal after liberal, including President Obama, speaking about what's going on, on campuses, but they can't even acknowledge that this is going on when they see the film, which is about the suppression of speech.</p><p>CAROLLA: I have a slightly different feeling on it. Yes, well, here's what I think. I feel like the pendulum is starting to swing back the other direction.</p><p>I mean, the comedic community and I feel a lot of my cohorts in the comedy world are starting to push back against it because they're at their saturation level. And I feel like the group that started this thing is starting to double down on it, starting to really work it harder.'</p><p>It's sort of the same subject is racism. As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.</p><p>PRAGER: I think he is right about the comedic community. That's correct. Outside of that, I don't think it's true. San Francisco 49'er color announcer -- and I'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the Baltimore Ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. So the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.</p><p>And the guy was said, you're a racist. And unless he apologized profusely as in Mao's China in the Cultural Revolution, he would have lost his job.</p><p>CAROLLA: Defensive line, but we know what you're talking about.</p><p>CARLSON: So I wonder if we are at the point though where --</p><p>PRAGER: That's right, defensive line. You are right and that was a boo- boo.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder if it's counterproductive -- okay, but the point remains, is it -- I mean, what about the people who are facing this problem and there are a lot of them, not just famous people, but normal people who are under attack by the HR department down the hall. What's the right response for them? Should they go through the Mao's China routine where they apologize and beg forgiveness? Or do they stand on principle?</p><p>PRAGER: Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this. But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.</p><p>It's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it.</p><p>CAROLLA: Well, I think we're going to have to do it this way because I do my own podcast. I have my own pirate ship. I have autonomy. I can say what I want. I don't have to apologize. And thus, I'm not asked to apologize because I never apologize.</p><p>But for guys who do announcers for the 49'ers, what are they to do?</p><p>PRAGER: No, I know. It's a horrible, horrible dilemma.</p><p>CAROLLA: What we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. I mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. If we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.</p><p>PRAGER: By the way, just let me remind people, because it's a great film. nosafespaces.com and they can find out where it's playing.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think they will. Adam and Dennis. Good to see both tonight. Thank you.</p><p>PRAGER: Thank you.</p><p>CAROLLA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So months after Jeffrey Epstein's death, however, that occurred, his alleged fixer is still free. Where is she? New reports tonight about where and who is protecting her? Remarkable story. Trace Gallagher fills us in after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, according to multiple sources Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's fixer, the person who facilitated his abuse of teenage girls. But since Epstein's death, Maxwell has rarely appeared in public and has not been charged with any crime.</p><p>Now, according to a new report, that is not an accident. Apparently she is being protected. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has more this story. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. The question has long lingered about whether his ex-girlfriend and confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell would face charges for allegedly recruiting and grooming these young girls for underage sex.</p><p>But our corporate cousin, \"The New York Post\" says, for now Maxwell is untouchable with the source saying, quote, \"Ghislaine is protected. She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments. They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net -- caught at Epstein's house.\"</p><p>Adding, quoting here, \"She is not in the U.S. She moves around. She is sometimes in the U.K., but most often in other countries such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.\"</p><p>And separately, we should note, a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell tells \"The Sun\" newspaper that she has enough dirt on those powerful contacts that she expects to avoid any prosecution at all -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A little test to whether justice is real. Trace Gallagher, thanks for much for that tonight. Good to see you.</p><p>Well, that's it for us.

Its limbs have grown[1] unexpectedly quickly, and it's a bit clumsy walking down the hall, all gangly angles and elbows. Its relationships with others[2] at times seem governed less by reason than by something deeply adolescent. It gets into yelling matches with Dad[3], or else just sits sullen when it's caught doing something it shouldn't[4]. Because it has become, alongside Google, the largest director of human attention in our species' history, Facebook has impacted pretty much everything in one way or another in the past sesquidecade[5]. But few have felt its force more than the news industry, which has tried at various times to steer into and against its gale-force winds \u2014 on net, to little success. </p><p>So with Facebook celebrating a big day today, I thought it might be useful to look back at the 15 most important dates in Facebook's history for news publishers (and those who love them).September 5, 2006: Facebook launches News Feed.[6]It may be hard to remember, but the all-consuming stream of updates wasn't part of Facebook at the beginning. That didn't arrive until more than two years after launch, with this note from product manager Ruchi Sanghvi[7]: News Feed highlights what's happening in your social circles on Facebook. It updates a personalized list of news stories throughout the day, so you'll know when Mark adds Britney Spears to his Favorites or when your crush is single again. Now, whenever you log in, you'll get the latest headlines generated by the activity of your friends and social groups. (That whole 'we'll help you stalk that girl' vibe is thankfully something you don't see in Facebook's messaging today.) Also from the announcement: News Feed and Mini-Feed are a different way of looking at the news about your friends, but they do not give out any information that wasn't already visible. Your privacy settings remain the same \u2014 the people who couldn't see your info before still can't see it now. Indeed, this was the first major moment where users had to face the reality that once they add information to this giant database in the sky, they give up at least some control over what happens to it next. Going from 'I thought this was only for the small group of people who visit my profile' to 'OMG now I'm getting poked by that creep in Econ who knows I'm single again' was in some ways Facebook's privacy reckoning. And indeed, users hated it[8], Mark Zuckerberg responded in the most condescending way possible ('Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.'), and people moved on. For publishers who were paying attention at the time \u2014 not many were \u2014 it showed that Facebook understood the power of remixing the small bits of content its users gave it into a larger experience, something that could eventually be a platform for content sharing. It also showed them that 'News' doesn't always mean 'news.' April 9, 2012: Facebook buys Instagram for $1 billion.[9]Has a price ever seemed so ridiculously high at the time \u2014 and so ridiculously low a few years later? All credit to Zuckerberg: He saw the shift to visual sharing coming, he saw a platform that understood mobile, and he wasn't afraid to strike.  This was Facebook's first major acquisition, but of course it wasn't its last, with WhatsApp and Oculus the most prominent to follow. The Instagram buy showed publishers that when a new platform comes along that looks interesting, Facebook was happy to buy its way in. You were going to be dealing with Menlo Park no matter what. (It also showed Facebook that antitrust regulators, who in another era might have looked askance at this sort of expansion of market power, were enjoying a nice decade-long nap.) June 23, 2014: Facebook puts its thumb on the scale for video.[10]Facebook rejects that wording and has maintained that the increasing prominence of video in News Feed was an organic response to user desire. But this was the day Facebook announced that if it thinks you like video, it's going to give you more of it. And more of it. And more of it. The full blossoming of the 30-second, captions-on-screen, quick-clip social video can be traced back to this day. Here begineth the pivot. It would be a little over two years later that Facebook acknowledged[11] that it had been miscalculating how much people were watching video in the first place \u2014 exaggerating users' desire for and consumption of video to publishers and advertisers alike. May 12, 2015: Facebook introduces Instant Articles.[12]I think this day could be described as Peak Facebook when it comes to the publishing industry. (Not Peak Facebook overall, of course \u2014 that's likely still to come.) Facebook Instant Articles was at the same time a not-subtle dig on how terrible many news sites were on phones, a pure expression of the power of Facebook's ad-targeting capabilities, and a moment that, on another timeline, might have been the beginning of the end of the web as we know it. By saying news orgs should publish their stories directly inside Facebook \u2014 not just on the web \u2014 Instant Articles kicked off the meat of distributed publishing's bell curve: Google AMP and Apple News. (Snapchat Discover had launched a few months earlier.) With VR and especially voice, we still see the allure and risk of such a platform-driven strategy. In the end, most publishers decided Instant Articles wasn't worth the bother[13] or the rev share and moved back to the web. December 3, 2015: Facebook Live debuts for regular users.[14]If Facebook said you were going to do live video, then damn it, you were going to do live video! As publishers adjusted to the outsized power of the News Feed algorithm in their traffic stats, many were willing to do whatever it took, even turning the most uncharismatic print reporters into videographers and TV reporters. Facebook, a little bit spooked by Snapchat, knew that it needed a way to capture a more raw form of expression than their increasingly polished profiles could summon, and they thought Live was part of the answer.  For publishers, it was a source of both strategic confusion and money, as Facebook paid news organizations (and others) millions of dollars[15] in return for hitting a quota of Facebook Live videos each day or week. With digital advertising in the dumps, many publishers were happy to take the cash, as they would be later with Facebook Watch. Neither[16] ended very well[17]. May 9, 2016: Gizmodo alleges Facebook routinely suppresses conservative news[18].Ah, the Gizmodo story. You can debate how legitimate the story's thin sourcing was was \u2014 I certainly have[19] \u2014but either way, the outcome was a Facebook that felt it needed to shore up its right flank. Conservative publishers and activists complained[20] that Facebook was part of a liberal conspiracy to suppress the truth. The company held an emergency summit[21] with Glenn Beck, Erick Erickson, and others. It tried to convince Congress[22]. It changed how Trending Topics[23] worked. It turned the jobs of human over to algorithms[24]. It even eventually kills Trending Topics altogether[25]. This story was the real launching point for a broader conservative argument[26] that tech platforms are the enemy; it's how you end up with members of Congress complaining[27] Google blocked his search for 'Jesus,' blaming[28] Facebook for a drop in traffic at a conspiracy website, and asking[29] whether not Taylor Swift had been the victim of hate speech by a GQ writer. September 8, 2016: Facebook decides a Pulitzer-winning photograph is child porn.[30]This was a moment when many people realized that somehow, when they weren't looking, Facebook had been appointed editor-in-chief of global discourse. The backstory: A Norwegian author had posted to his Facebook page the famous Nick Ut[31] photo of a Vietnamese girl[32], naked and panicked, fleeing napalm. You've seen it.[33] Facebook's content moderators declared it child pornography[34] and banned the author from posting again. Norway's largest newspaper wrote a story about it, and that was taken down because it used the photo. Facebook even blocked Norway's prime minister[35] from posting it. Facebook changed its mind[36] a day later. But the 'napalm girl' incident drove home both the capriciousness and the ultimate dominion of Facebook's decision making. A few low-wage content moderators in the Philippines[37] could determine whether a newspaper got to share a story or not. November 8, 2016: Donald Trump is elected president of the United States.[38]To be clear, I'm not saying Facebook (or things that happened on its platform) swung the election. What I am saying is that Facebook's position in the world did a 180 once the outcome was clear. Whatever one thinks of Trump, he is a very unusual president, and the post-election searching for factors that might be behind that unusual outcome put the spotlight squarely on Facebook. One recent analysis[39] illustrated just how negative stories about Facebook turned in The New York Times right around the election. (Justifiably so, I'd argue.) Only the Cambridge Analytica revelations in 2018 would match it as a driver of negative coverage. All the talk around 'fake news' and 'information warfare' and 'filter bubbles' put Facebook on the defensive \u2014 in some cases unfairly, but in most not. (The Facebook Journalism Project[40] launched shortly thereafter, no accident.) And as perceptions of Facebook shifted from 'place where Grandma posts memes' to 'place that just may have played a supporting but not insignificant role in the foreign subversion of American democracy,' publishers started to feel a bit better about moving away from it as the be-all and end-all of audience development strategy. March 21, 2017: Facebook begins flagging false stories as 'disputed.'[41]This was the first significant effort by Facebook to save its own users from sharing nonsense. It was also a key moment in Facebook's partnership with fact-checking outfits like PolitiFact, the AP, and Snopes, under the banner of the International Fact-Checking Network. If two separate organizations Facebook was working with had declared a story false, Facebook would label it as 'disputed by multiple, independent fact-checkers.' This system didn't work very well, and Facebook moved away from it[42] within months. But what hasn't changed much is Facebook's outsourcing of this sort of work to news organizations \u2014 which protects Facebook from bias claims, but also shovels a lot of busy work onto publishers. (Just last week, one of them said they'd had enough[43].) January 11, 2018: Facebook says there's too much news showing up on Facebook.Oh, I'm sorry \u2014 I meant Facebook wants to be 'bringing people closer together,'[44] complete with a stock-photo hug. Facebook had made a number of moves[45] over the years to decrease the amount of publisher content on News Feed. (First they came for the clickbait[46], and I said nothing.) But it was the January 2018 announcement that most like a divorce filing. Zuckerberg went so far as to claim that it was publishers' fault people felt bad when they used Facebook: The research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long term measures of happiness and health. On the other hand, passively reading articles or watching videos \u2014 even if they're entertaining or informative \u2014 may not be as good. ('Passively reading articles' is also known as 'reading articles.') The shift meant more posts from friends and family, fewer from publishers. And for publishers to break through, their content had to 'encourage meaningful interactions between people.' God forbid news just be news \u2014 you gotta thumb it up now. Publishers, which in many cases had already seen Facebook traffic declining for some time, saw more of the same[47]. Facebook, which had been neck and neck with Google for sending the most traffic to publishers, fell off the map[48].  On one hand, no one likes losing audience. But on the other, this might have been the kick in the pants some publishers needed to think about what a sustainable news organization post-Facebook might look like.Illustration by Paul Chung[49] used under a Creative Commons license.

I'm Rebecca Diamond along with Eric Bolling and Cody Willard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And today on HAPPY HOUR, well Toyota reporting a 16 percent drop in monthly sales in January from a year ago. It is no wonder of course with more than nine million vehicles hitting the recall but more than just a sales problem, folks. Toyota is now in legal hot water with lawsuits, congressional hearings, and possible federal fines into the millions or even billions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd blasting administration for complicating financial reform -- this from the president's own man, his own party? Who's right -- the controversial Democratic senator or the president? We'll ask former bank -- former Sovereign Bank CEO Jay Sidhu.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And do you need a date for Valentine's Cay? Tis the season for matchmaking -- Match.com wants to bring dating into the 21st century. Will the company live happily ever after? Well we'll ask Match.com CEO Greg Blatt, but first Cody kicking off the show with \"Top Shelf\".</p><p>CODY WILLARD, CO-HOST: Did see the graphic from Match.com?</p><p>DIAMOND: What did it say?</p><p>WILLARD: A couple kissing.</p><p>DIAMOND: No, I was in the middle reading.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: Markets remain stuck in this range above 10,000 that they have obviously been in -- been bound by since early November, the Dow losing 26 points, the Nasdaq inching up a fraction and the S&amp;P 500 down six and change. And after-hours tonight we get some big tech earnings, got a couple of other earnings (INAUDIBLE) whatnot but I want to hit Cisco and Broadcom first.</p><p>Cisco, big networking company, $135 billion market cap. This is a big infrastructure technology company, great report. Beating both bottom and top lines, but more importantly than just beating it, actually showing sequential year-over-year growth on the top line, up eight percent. This company now has $40 billion in cash on the balance sheet.</p><p>DIAMOND: Wow! Wow! Yes, it says here you know higher than expected revenue. People upgrading, you know it's like you have all these devices and you want to go to all these Web sites. You want to watch movies on your computer, well you need that extra capacity to handle all of this so you need to upgrade.</p><p>I mean you buy a computer and the next year you need to upgrade everything. Does this company also deal with wireless devices is my question, since there is so much more gadgets out there but wireless?</p><p>WILLARD: Somewhat yes, but more importantly than the wireless itself, this is a company that runs the actual Internet behind the wireless. So if you're on your iPad or on your iPhone on AT&amp;T , AT&amp;T has to figure out how to get more capacity to everybody on the network.</p><p>DIAMOND: Cisco.</p><p>WILLARD: And Cisco is a big part of that -- Juniper too by the way.</p><p>ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Real quickly if you look back, if you've been watching HAPPY HOUR long enough, we've been talking about Cisco a long time, I think around 15 or $16. We said you have to own this one because when the economy does turn around when people start buying computers again, when they start putting Cisco hardware and infrastructure into the system, the Internet system, that's the one that's going to work. And look, we're up from about, I think 17. So what is that six, almost 30 percent winner if you've been listening and you've been playing along.</p><p>DIAMOND: So do you think then this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: . great report is a sign that the economy is turning around?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>DIAMOND: People are spending their money. They're investing businesses and individuals?</p><p>BOLLING: Yes, remember the banking system turned around first. Technology had been lagging. Now tech is catching up and I think you shouldn't worry about paying 23 or $24 a share.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>WILLARD: And Cisco specifically is in a good market. Cisco, a big part of their business is actually the banking industry. They sell a lot of computer networking infrastructure to the Goldman Sachs of the world, high-speed Internet trading. You hear about that stuff, the high speed velocity trading. That's -- Cisco is big in that. And also, like you asked, they are part of the wireless infrastructure building boom.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>WILLARD: Again, they don't necessarily make the wireless pieces outside on those towers.</p><p>DIAMOND: But they benefit.</p><p>WILLARD: But they benefit from the spending.</p><p>DIAMOND: We can also hit Visa. I mean this is one that people look to, to see if people are, if individuals are making more purchases with their credit cards. Seventy-five percent jump in quarterly net income. You know, people using the credit card, maybe out of necessity or just wanting to, but also because they're getting more fees. They're able to raise their prices these days to benefit from this.</p><p>WILLARD: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: Yes and what -- inside some of these reports, the Visas and the MasterCards, I'd like to dig deep, and I haven't seen it yet, it just came out.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: But the gasoline as a purchase -- gasoline prices go up a lot of people use their credit cards, so that's just an automatic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: . wind -- tailwind to the Visa and MasterCard, but up three percent after-hours.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: Up three percent after-hours and.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: And Visa obviously a good tell for the consumer spending, but as Eric says, there is lot of noise in that report itself.</p><p>DIAMOND: Or out of necessity, you know you're buying groceries because you don't have the cash.</p><p>WILLARD: Well and like you said, though, the point I want to make was they have a lot of pricing power. Guess what that is -- inflation.</p><p>DIAMOND: Or also corners on the market. They have the market cornered pretty much.</p><p>WILLARD: Monopoly so they can jack up the prices along with their MasterCard cohort. Regardless, the consumers get hit with inflation.</p><p>BOLLING: All right, we've got to move on -- the middle class is the economic engine of America, but who is the middle class and does the Obama administration and Congress really know what the middle class wants? In fact there is now a group of Democrats in Congress who claim they have the middle class on their mind all the time.</p><p>Joining us now from D.C. Democrat Bruce Braley, chairman of the House Populist Caucus -- all right, sir, Populist Caucus, you have the middle class on your mind, yet your voting record -- I'm going to get in trouble for saying this. I'm sure \"Media Matters\" is going to pick me apart for this. But your voting record looks a lot like a porn site for liberalism. And what do I mean by that. I mean health care you voted yes. Obama budget you voted yes. Stimulus bill, you voted yes. TARP one and two you voted in favor. Auto bailout, yes.</p><p>WILLARD: Populist reins.</p><p>BOLLING: Sir, where in the world, sir in all due respect, do you think the middle wants all this spending out of Washington? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>REP. BRUCE BRALEY (D), IOWA: No. And you misrepresented my vote on the first TARP bill, which I voted against. And it wasn't until the Senate came back and had direct funding that impacted the middle class and Main Street in my district that I agreed to support it, to help us recover from the worst economic crisis since the great depression.</p><p>But I founded the Populist Caucus to fight for middle class values and to strengthen and expand the middle class. And that's why we've been focused on policies that are going to crack down on Wall Street abuses. Use those revenues to generate new income to create jobs, and reduce the deficit and also to send a strong message that middle class workers have been left out of this recovery, and a jobless recovery isn't a recovery.</p><p>WILLARD: Representative, I mean, I think Eric is actually referencing not just the initial TARP vote that you voted, yes to as after the Senate came back with a larger package, an extra $100 billion in pork on it but you also voted that they should release second TARP funds later. The point being, those are outrageous -- those are outrageously offensive to mainstream America.</p><p>The populist outrage is exactly against those Wall Street bailouts that now you come out and the other side of your mouth and you tell us that we need to crack down on Wall Street. We wanted you to crack down on Wall Street instead of bailing it out the first time.</p><p>BRALEY: Well, you've got it completely wrong. If you think the disaster assistance to people who lost their homes and businesses in the worst flooding in my state's history is pork I would challenge you to come talk to the families and businesses who lost their homes. That was part of what was in that Senate package. So you can't just out throw out these broad characterizations off what it did.</p><p>But look, our whole focus is to try to focus on creating a new value system on Wall Street that cracks down on people who get excessive compensation, use that to get money to small businesses, who are being denied access to credit right now after those banks were rescued by Main Street taxpayers, same thing with our transfer fee on excessive speculation.</p><p>DIAMOND: Well Representative.</p><p>BRALEY: We can generate $150 billion and use that to reduce the deficit and create jobs.</p><p>DIAMOND: This is what I think we're all trying to get at is that the populism representing America is they don't want Washington to get extremely involved in our lives. And here you are -- you know I'm looking at your blueprint for recovery, and you want a Wall Street bonus tax act. You also want a national infrastructure development bank act.</p><p>You want to create a government corporation that is going to dole out these infrastructure jobs, a buy American improvement act. Let Wall Street pay for the restoration of Main Street act. I mean my goodness, that's a lot of new regulations. And you know what they're going to do? They're just going to put the fees on to us little guys.</p><p>BRALEY: No, that is not true. Why would you be opposed to a buy American act that forces taxpayer money to be used to support American businesses, buy American products and promote American jobs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRALEY: Our main competitors.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: . competition and the best prices.</p><p>BRALEY: . are China and Japan and they're already doing this.</p><p>BOLLING: Hey, Representative let me read this and this is from the \"Huffington Post\". You say that the caucus will give voice to the populist anger created by the plummeting economy and opaque bank bailout, yet TARP one, TARP two, stimulus, auto bailouts, AIG, 90 percent taxpayers. You're being disingenuous. You're worst than a Blue Dog Democrat. At least they pretend to be fiscally responsible. There is nothing fiscally responsible about some of the votes you've made.</p><p>BRALEY: Well what is wrong with creating $150 billion in new revenues by a modest transfer fee on excess speculative trading on Wall Street, half of which would be devoted to job creation and half of which.</p><p>WILLARD: Representative.</p><p>BRALEY: . would be devoted to reducing the deficit.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRALEY: I don't understand why you're upset with that.</p><p>WILLARD: You're trying to put the genie -- we are very upset because you're trying to put the genie back in the bottle. It is too late. Instead of sending $1 trillion Wall Street and then saying now we need to recoup some of it, we simply wanted you to enforce contract law and prosecute the crooks down there.</p><p>BRALEY: Oh and who is responsible for that? I believe the Bush administration Justice Department which allowed all of this rampant speculation to take place without any pushback. And you're absolutely right -- we do need to enforce the law. We do need to crack down on people who are violating it and we do need to prosecute them and I fully support that.</p><p>BOLLING: And we need to stop bailing out companies and taking companies.</p><p>WILLARD: Nationalized.</p><p>BOLLING: . public companies and nationalize them like GM, like Fannie, like Freddie, like Chrysler. Listen, this is your voting record sir, not mine.</p><p>BRALEY: Well any time you want to come down and have a meaningful substantive conversation about my voting record.</p><p>DIAMOND: We just did.</p><p>BRALEY: . I'd be happy to have it.</p><p>DIAMOND: Come on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRALEY: Because you're choosing to decide which of my votes to talk about.</p><p>BOLLING: Sir, sir -- I will.</p><p>DIAMOND: Well I think we just.</p><p>BOLLING: I would like -- I will come to Washington. I will sit next to you and we'll discuss this. That would be great.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRALEY: Please, I would be happy to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: We covered a lot of good stuff here as well, Representative.</p><p>BRALEY: These policies are good for Americans and they help the middle class and that's why we're promoting them.</p><p>WILLARD: All right.</p><p>DIAMOND: Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLARD: Thank you so much, Representative Bruce Braley. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>\"On Tap\" guys, Toyota's legal troubles accelerating. Can the company survive the lawsuits that keep piling up? We talk to one attorney who is ready to take on Toyota -- a lot more HAPPY HOUR next.</p><p>DIAMOND: Welcome back to HAPPY HOUR, everyone. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood today urging owners of those recalled Toyotas to stop driving the vehicles and then backpedaling saying he was not issuing a new federal recommendation. Probably was just his own take on what people should do with these potentially dangerous cars.</p><p>All this while the Prius shifts into focus as -- wow -- the newest problem for Toyota here and also in Japan now, so with Toyota already on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions, folks, can it survive the coming car wreck that it is going to be in instead of a driver this time?</p><p>Joining us for HAPPY HOUR now, is David Ennis. He is an attorney representing some of the folks suing Toyota. David thanks so much for joining us for HAPPY HOUR. So what is going to be your angle in this lawsuit? I know I've -- today on FOX Business I already saw the commercials where the attorneys are asking people, you know, if they have been in a car wreck and they own a Toyota to call them. How are you going to position this to win this lawsuit?</p><p>DAVID ENNIS, ENNIS &amp; ENNIS LAW: Well, first, thanks for having me on this program to discuss these issues.</p><p>DIAMOND: Sure.</p><p>ENNIS: As of last week, there are -- every lawyer is a Toyota lawyer now.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>ENNIS: Fortunately, we over the last five months, ever since the accident in San Diego, when I observed that accident on TV it just didn't pass my smell test. And we started receiving phone calls on these issues with -- and then the recalls came out and it just built up steam and steam and steam and where we are today.</p><p>There are going to be three different types of lawsuits. There are going to be individual lawsuits for people who are seriously injured, wrongful death cases that we're handling. There are going to be class action lawsuits for folks who have not had personal injuries but have one of these recalled vehicles.</p><p>\"Consumer Reports\" really hurt the company by saying that they're not going to recommend these vehicles and they don't recommend any used car dealers purchasing these vehicles. So, Toyota is going to have to deal with a class action.</p><p>DIAMOND: Wow.</p><p>ENNIS: Yes. I mean -- I mean Toyota is going to have to deal with somehow getting remedies to these folks, you know when they want to trade their vehicle in, loss of use of the vehicle.</p><p>WILLARD: David?</p><p>ENNIS: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>WILLARD: As you -- as -- I know that your business model basically depends on the company, I don't know, being hit with penalties and either that or settling with you in order, you know with your victims and therefore -- thereby you get paid. Are we sure this is actually productive for society? Should the government be stepping in -- if there is truly a problem with Toyota cars, should the government step in and shutting it down or something else?</p><p>ENNIS: Well I don't think the -- well let me tell you, I think you're hitting a good point. I think the question that everybody is afraid to ask is, is, you know, can Toyota go bankrupt over this? I don't think Toyota has to go bankrupt over this. If they handle their litigation like the way they handle this recall they will go into bankruptcy.</p><p>They have to get out in front of this litigation and take care of its consumers and take care of the victims that have been hurt. I don't think -- I think if you read the -- what you've been reading is NHTSA and the transportation secretary has been trying to work with them over the last couple of months because they don't want to put this company into bankruptcy. They don't want Americans losing jobs. They don't.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>ENNIS: They don't -- I mean that is not the intent. Nobody wins in a bankruptcy, OK, especially my clients. So nobody wants to bankrupt these people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well.</p><p>ENNIS: That will be determined -- that will be determined by.</p><p>BOLLING: Let's be straightforward. The lawyers, the litigants, the attorneys win, maybe not necessarily their class action plaintiffs.</p><p>ENNIS: If they.</p><p>BOLLING: They rarely win much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Here's the question. Let me get to my -- my question is this. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood yesterday making some comments and today making some very, very important comments saying if you own a Toyota in one of these makes and models you should not drive it. Is that his responsibility to do that?</p><p>ENNIS: I will tell you this, OK, and I think I'm one of the few people who can speak to this and speak to what happened to the transportation secretary. I've been fielding these calls for five months, OK, when you field these calls for five months and I'm going to give you a perfect example, sir. I have a couple in Wisconsin who calls me up and says we bought a brand new Toyota in August for our (ph) 3-month-old baby. It's our first brand new car. What do I do? Now as a lawyer, OK, I'm in a big conflict, OK?</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>ENNIS: I understand where the transportation secretary is coming from. I have to tell that client, ma'am, if it was my family, I wouldn't put my wife and my kids in that car. I think.</p><p>DIAMOND: But the unfortunate thing about it David is that people, you know.</p><p>ENNIS: Yes, they have to go.</p><p>DIAMOND: I've been sharing my story with my sister and my niece.</p><p>ENNIS: Yes, yes.</p><p>DIAMOND: . 3-year-old, 4-year-old, 11-year-old, this is their only car, their only way to get the kids to work, to school and their only way to get to work. That's why people are so fired up and upset about this.</p><p>ENNIS: As a practical what is going to happen is, and what is the -- what -- it's on the transportation secretary's conscience. What's he -- right now what he was trying to do is and he was probably very upset. He is probably tired. He is aggravated and you know he misspoke this morning. I will give him a free pass on that. What he.</p><p>BOLLING: Well you will but I'm not sure I will. That's my problem.</p><p>ENNIS: I understand that, but here's the problem, sir. He's in a big pickle. Everybody is in a big pickle. What has happened here and what we need to ask here is.</p><p>BOLLING: All right.</p><p>ENNIS: . this is a global -- when you're in a global economy and you have a foreign corporation who is providing vehicles here -- yes.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: David we have got to go. I'm sorry. We're coming up against a hard break. We appreciate your time.</p><p>DIAMOND: Toyota is in the biggest pickle.</p><p>BOLLING: David Ennis.</p><p>DIAMOND: Thanks.</p><p>ENNIS: Thank you very much.</p><p>BOLLING: Thank you.</p><p>ENNIS: Bye.</p><p>BOLLING: All right \"On Tap\", have the administration's efforts to overhaul the banking system gone too far? New Century Bank CEO Jay Sidhu weighs in when HAPPY HOUR returns.</p><p>BOLLING: Oh, oh, trouble in liberal paradise? Listen to this interchange between Senator Chris Dodd and former Fed Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT: When you call down and say how does it work and specifically what you had in mind, I expect the answers to the questions. And we've made the calls and we're not getting good answers.</p><p>PAUL VOLCKER, ECONOMIC RECOVERY BOARD ADVISOR: Let me just respond little bit if I can. I -- it is really important I think to get this right.</p><p>DODD: Yes.</p><p>VOLCKER: And if you don't do it in the first round, god knows when the second round.</p><p>DODD: I don't know either but you know you can't add stuff every day to me on this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLLING: All right, so when do you think -- who do you think is defending President Obama's banking proposals, a liberal Democrat senator or a Fed chairman served -- who served under Ronald Reagan? That was Mr. Dodd curiously enough suggesting the banking regulations may be getting too tough, but why?</p><p>Let's ask Jay Sidhu. He was the CEO of Sovereign Bank and is currently the CEO of New Century Bank. Why would Senator Dodd who, you know you would think he would be for tougher banking regulations. A Democrat, a senator who sits on the Senate Banking Committee all of a sudden saying hey, wait a minute, maybe this is going too far?</p><p>JAY SIDHU, FMR. SOVEREIGN BANK CEO: Well, I think he is retiring. That's why he is talking the truth. I think the point is let's analyze what are the top five problems, what got the banks into trouble. Number one was leverage. Number two, was that you know we had a very easy monetary policy. The Fed kept the interest rates too low.</p><p>Number three was the Democratic Congress, as well as many Republicans pushed home ownership. They said let's keep pushing it until we crash. Let's find out when we will crash. And so when the homeownership hit 69 percent the market crashed. Another one is that we had derivatives. We were allowing banks to be creating derivatives, insurance companies to be creating derivatives, and there were no regulation and no controls over it.</p><p>So the real problem, let's address the root causes. And not to be talking about whether banks should be allowed to own hedge funds. Banks should be allowed to own private equity firms. I don't know of any bank that got into trouble because they own hedge funds. I don't know any bank that got into trouble because of private equity. I don't know any bank that's feeling.</p><p>WILLARD: But Jay.</p><p>SIDHU: . because they were too big.</p><p>DIAMOND: Hold on, hold on, let him finish.</p><p>WILLARD: Jay, you know.</p><p>DIAMOND: Jay.</p><p>WILLARD: Go ahead.</p><p>DIAMOND: Go ahead.</p><p>SIDHU: Go ahead.</p><p>WILLARD: Jay, I guess the idea.</p><p>SIDHU: So the point is.</p><p>WILLARD: . I don't think that Volcker was actually saying that stopping banks from trading like hedge funds is going to fix what actually caused the crisis. He is simply saying it is offensive to the average American that these banks are trading and taking risks with welfare money.</p><p>SIDHU: I think what is the business of banking? The raw material of banks is gathering deposits, paying a fair rate for it to process it and put it to work. So when the banking system got into trouble, everybody said the economy and the world economy is going to fall. So since when is the banking business bad business?</p><p>DIAMOND: Jay.</p><p>SIDHU: It is a good business. And now we you shouldn't have -- we shouldn't have just unnecessary controls over it, but there (INAUDIBLE) problems. We have to got fix the problem. And the problem is like what I said it was lack of appropriate regulation. Lack of coordination between monetary policy, fiscal policy and ideology of it is great to have homeownership and a lack of control over derivatives.</p><p>DIAMOND: Right and the low interest rates and on and on and on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: Jay, but you know I think you're on to something because I said yesterday as well with this whole Volcker rule, you know why is it wrong for a bank, a financial institution to want to trade its own money in, you know, invest its money as it sees fit to make a profit? You know I don't see where that -- maybe the overleveraging aspect, but that had more to do with the housing market.</p><p>SIDHU: Absolutely right. We have the whole problem with the global economy is too much leverage. We've seen the consumer deleverage. We're seeing corporations deleverage. But nobody is talking about the sovereign nations need to delever too. I mean look at the debt in the United States.</p><p>We are going to be in trouble in the United States. That's where we should be addressing our major problems and not talking about more and more unnecessary stupid regulations for banks.</p><p>WILLARD: Jay Sidhu.</p><p>SIDHU: You know and just because it is a popular thing it is not a nice thing to do.</p><p>WILLARD: It is not a nice thing to do to keep asking me to bail people out. Jay Sidhu, thank you for joining us.</p><p>\"On Tap\" on HAPPY HOUR guys, I'm shaking down the \"Shot Clock\". Monica Crowley joins Eric for today's \"Street Meat\". It's getting hot in here. And in Rebecca's \"Diamond District\", Equinox Fitness CEO Harvey Spevak says he increased jobs and expanded his company even in this recession. He explains his business secrets when HAPPY HOUR returns.</p><p>DIAMOND: That's a nice gym.</p><p>WILLARD: Do you guys remember there was some bidding for a charity called Faces of Khabir (ph), I'd go to dinner with anybody who actually bid on this? And we actually have a lady in the house tonight got second place. Bid 2,200 bucks or something on me. I'm going to grab a drink with her after the show. Anyway, any time you're in New York City, come by the bar. If we can, we'll hang out with you guys.</p><p>Number one: Volcker's plans actually do provide some help. We were just talking with a banker, and earlier, we were talking with a congressman about some of Volcker's plans. And yes, he's calling for hedge funds not to be allowed to be inside of banks in any way, shape or form. Of course, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley going to basically slip through that loophole because they're pure investment banks still, even though they've become banks that can borrow at the Federal Reserve zero percent rate. At any rate, guys, there's also rules in Volcker's plans of enforcing antitrust laws and not letting the banks get too big to fail, and that actually is systematically helpful to our system.</p><p>Number two, guys: Despite all of these rules, no matter what Volcker, Dodd decide with bailing out banks in the future and allowing moral hazard to grow, there are still places to invest in this economy. You have to find sectors that are immune from government interference, from government changes. There's one for you know (ph) the Internet usage over wireless networks is going to increase. You just heard Cisco have a blowout quarter after-hours. Guys, that's a pure play. Not a pure play, that's a good play on that. I've got a lot more coming of plays on the AT&amp;T infrastructure buildout.</p><p>And speaking of which, guys, you know, it's not just the iPad and the iPhone, the iTouch and all these other devices that are going to be accessing the Internet over wireless technologies. Juju (ph), the Juju.com -- go check it out. It's a pretty cool new little pad. Google apparently has got some of its own Google pad in the works somewhere in the next year or two, guys. Lots and lots of growth in technology and wireless networking. There are plays. There's ways to make money.</p><p>Eric Bolling, I know you know ways to make money.</p><p>BOLLING: Oh, I certainly do. But listen, guys, it's Wednesday. It must be a one-on-one with Monica Crowley. Hey, guys, what do you think of the one on one with Monica Crowley?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Woo-hoo!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Woo-hoo!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Woo-hoo!</p><p>BOLLING: Exactly! OK, Monica Crowley...</p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, guys!</p><p>BOLLING: ... two White House mea culpas today. Let's talk about the first one, Rahm -- our good friend, Rahm Emanuel. He used \"F-ing retarded\" line when discussing some things that may have gone on. He had to step up and apologize yet again. So what about it?</p><p>CROWLEY: That's right. He called Tim Shriver, who's the head of Special Olympics. He apologized. The White House also was forced out to put out a statement apologizing. And now he's going to go talk about developmental disabilities.</p><p>Look, this is not the first time this has come out of the White House. Remember when President Obama made that crack to Jay Leno about the Special Olympics? Then he had to call Tim Shriver and put out a statement of apology.</p><p>Look, there are 40 million families in this country that have special needs children. The president of the United States, his chief of staff and his representatives should know better. I'm not big on the word police. I don't believe in that. But when you're representing the country and/or the president of the United States, you should not be using that kind of terminology.</p><p>BOLLING: All right (INAUDIBLE) the one I really want to get to. Eric Holder today came out and said, Hey, guess what, guys? I made the call 50 minutes -- 5-0 minutes -- into interrogating or gaining intel from the underpants terrorist, Christmas Day bomber, to go and let him lawyer up, give him Miranda and say, you know, You want a lawyer, you can shut up right now and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CROWLEY: And he did. And he did.</p><p>BOLLING: And he did. What about it?</p><p>CROWLEY: Abdulmutallab then zipped his lip as soon as he had an attorney, and that was end of any kind of valuable intelligence that we could have gotten out of this terrorist. Look, I have no doubt that Eric Holder did make the decision almost an hour into this interrogation to cut it off, Mirandize the guy and get him an attorney.</p><p>However, he's not freelancing these decisions. Everybody in this cabinet, including Holder, serves at the pleasure of the president, meaning they're taking their cues from him. His statement today is basically trying to protect Obama from the slings and arrows that he knows are going to come his way from making this absolutely outrageous decision! But keep in mind that it is the commander-in-chief who sets the agenda, the tone and the policy that Holder is just carrying out.</p><p>BOLLING: There was testimony today by the group -- when they were talking about what exactly went on with this bomber, this terrorist, and I think it was the California congresswoman...</p><p>CROWLEY: Senator Dianne Feinstein.</p><p>BOLLING: I'm sorry, Senator Feinstein, saying, We got -- we continue to get intel from this guy, so we really didn't lose anything. Did we lose anything?</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes. We lost valuable time because as soon as he was Mirandized and got an attorney, he shut up. Days, weeks went by, Eric, where he was not saying anything. Now they're saying, Well, he's talking again because he got a visit from his daddy -- who I want to give all props to because his father was the one who went to the U.S. embassy in Nigeria, said, My son is being radicalized. He's in on al Qaeda plot. You guys better watch him. They allowed his father -- his father talked to him, and now, apparently, he's talking.</p><p>Here's my problem. You don't say -- you don't tell publicly what he is saying! You've got administration officials out there blabbing up storm now, Well, he's telling us what training camps he was in and...</p><p>BOLLING: Did he say...</p><p>CROWLEY: ... who trained him...</p><p>BOLLING: ... there were 30 bombers...</p><p>CROWLEY: Come on!</p><p>BOLLING: ... ready to go in the 50 minutes that we did get out of him?</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: And then we...</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: And then all of a sudden (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CROWLEY: You know what, Eric? You know what, what struck me about that? When we apprehended him, he said, I know specifically of between 20 and 30 imminent plots against the United States. Isn't that the ticking time bomb theory that we have been talking about since 9/11, that the left said, Well, in a ticking time bomb scenario, of course we would use enhanced interrogation techniques or waterboarding to extract that information. We didn't here. We gave him a lawyer!</p><p>BOLLING: I'm on board with Monica. Real quickly, yes or no answers. We're running out of time. Rahm Emanuel -- heads roll, yes, no?</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes, within, I would say, the next six months.</p><p>BOLLING: Six months?</p><p>CROWLEY: And replaced by Valerie Jarrett.</p><p>BOLLING: Very -- oh, good. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Eric Holder, heads roll?</p><p>CROWLEY: Not immediately, no.</p><p>BOLLING: All right. Rebecca, we're going to send it over to you now.</p><p>CROWLEY: He should, but no.</p><p>BOLLING: Good stuff, Monica. See you next Wednesday.</p><p>CROWLEY: OK.</p><p>DIAMOND: All right, from politics to jobs, something way more important than all that BS on Capitol Hill, right? All right, welcome to \"The Diamond District,\" everyone. President Obama pushing hard to promote lending to small businesses. It's the administration's latest effort it thinks will save jobs. Listen to this, the president outlining his plan in New Hampshire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm announcing a proposal to take $30 billion of the money that was repaid by Wall Street banks and use it to create a new small business lending fund that will provide capital for community banks on Main Street. The more loans these smaller banks provide to creditworthy small business, the better deal we'll give them on capital from this fund that we've set up. All of this will help small banks do even more of what our economy needs, and that's ensure that small businesses are once again the engine of job growth in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DIAMOND: All right, it all sounds great. You listen to that, you're, like, Wow, great. Not so fast! You know, do these proposals actually help this struggling economy, or should lawmakers just let smart business owners work their magic without all the government intervention?</p><p>Joining me now is someone who can really, really speak to this, folks, Harvey Spevak. He's the CEO of Equinox Fitness. Now, he grew his business during the recession and he's added jobs during this recession, when, of course, we've had the highest unemployment rate. Harvey, good to see you. Welcome to \"The Diamond District.\"</p><p>HARVEY SPEVAK, EQUINOX FITNESS CEO: Thank you.</p><p>DIAMOND: You know, it's this thing that we've been debating here on \"Happy Hour.\" You know, does this government intervention, these government programs -- the latest one, $30 billion to small business lending, you know, so people can expand their business, as you have...</p><p>SPEVAK: Sure.</p><p>DIAMOND: Does that help or does this -- more of this rules and regulations just get in the way of what you're trying to do?</p><p>SPEVAK: I generally think it can't hurt, but I think, ultimately, it starts with the company taking control of their own destiny. So you know, at Equinox, we've done a number of things (INAUDIBLE) consistent with our history, but a number of things over the last year to really ensure our continued success as a company.</p><p>DIAMOND: You know, it's one of those things. I when we have business owners here, they're, like, Well, I can't decide to do this or do that because I don't know what's going to happen with the union check card or health care. And I say, You never know what's going to happen. You can't let that freeze you into doing nothing. And regardless of health care and so forth, whatever's going to happen with that, you're moving ahead with your business plans. You've opened more gyms. I don't know if you can call Equinox a gym because it's so nice!</p><p>SPEVAK: Thank you.</p><p>DIAMOND: And you've hired a lot more people.</p><p>SPEVAK: Yes, no, we opened four locations last year. And you know, when the recession hit, we looked at our business. 2008 was a record year for us. Over the last three years, we've created over 40 percent jobs just in our company, not including construction jobs with our new locations, which are more temporary jobs. Each time we open a club, we create almost 200 new jobs just to build that location.</p><p>DIAMOND: Right.</p><p>SPEVAK: And then we employ about 150 employees going forward. So we've created a lot of jobs. Including the last year, we've added about 600 new employees to the Equinox family. But part of how we did that is controlling our own destiny, is not relying on others, whether it be government or other decisions being made. We really focused on doing what we do well, which is driving unparalleled member experience and making sure our members understand the necessity of an Equinox membership as compared to the luxury of an Equinox membership.</p><p>DIAMOND: And that's key because, you know, the first thing that people would cut back, you would think it would be, OK, Starbucks, gym membership, and you know, maybe all -- other things that they consider luxuries. How do you turn that thinking around to that this is a necessity, something you have to do for your health?</p><p>SPEVAK: Look, Equinox has always been uniquely positioned, as you highlighted, and so we did a number of things. But you know, the first thing that most people can do is cut costs, and we actually went the other way. We've always been recognized nationally and internationally for driving an unparalleled member experience. And so what we did is we looked for ways to improve that member experience. So we introduced new programs, whether it be new classes, new personal training programs, but also new experiential elements. So by way of example, Kiehl's, which you're probably familiar with...</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>SPEVAK: We launched an exclusive partnership with them in the third quarter of 2009. And so now their products are featured in our locker rooms. So that's just one example of things that we did that cost us money...</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>SPEVAK: ... but we did to show our members that we're really focused on their experience, to encourage to spend more time with us. And actually, over the last year, we've seen our engagement rate, which means the participation of our members, increase from 2009 as compared to 2008.</p><p>DIAMOND: So you actually make them think that, I got to have it. I got to have my Equinox gym membership! I've got to point out that from -- over 2008, 2009, or in 2009, I should say, 37 percent employee growth since -- oh, it's 2006 to 2009. That's really, really good.</p><p>SPEVAK: Thank you. I mean, we've got a great team, a team that we're really proud of. You know, we have 50 locations around the United States. We've never open and closed a location. As I mentioned, we opened four locations in 2008, four locations in 2009. And we're actually now really looking forward to expanding and taking advantage of what is a soft real estate market to continue to grow our franchise.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes. Like you say, if you're smart about your decisions in the good times, you can -- you have that money where you can take advantage of these commercial real estate deals that are out there. Also, we've got to just mention very quickly about the pure yoga. You're now expanding into a new brand, where it's a version of Equinox but solely for yoga aficionados, like myself and a lot more people, I'm sure. Harvey Spevak, thank you very much for joining me in \"The Diamond District.\"</p><p>SPEVAK: Thank you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>DIAMOND: Continued success!</p><p>SPEVAK: Thank you.</p><p>DIAMOND: I love these success stories. And I guess if you're looking for a job, guys, go apply at Equinox, and even if you're in construction because they're building more of them. Thank you.</p><p>SPEVAK: Thank you.</p><p>DIAMOND: All right, on tap, folks: Are you looking for love in all the wrong places? Well, our next guest may be able to help you find that special someone. This guy better. It's his industry. He's the CEO of Match.com. And we'll talk to him next when \"Happy Hour\" returns.</p><p>WILLARD: Is your dating life a little down in the dumps? Not having any luck finding someone at the bar or the club scene or church? How about a little on-line love? Right now is indeed the peak season for on-line dating, and who better to tell us all about the new trends in the industry than Match.com CEO Gregory Blatt. Welcome to the show, Gregory.</p><p>GREGORY R. BLATT, MATCH.COM CEO: Thank you. How are you?</p><p>WILLARD: All right, so how -- huge growth business. Obviously, people more and more are interacting on the Internet. But I would think FaceBook is actually competition for you guys.</p><p>BLATT: No, FaceBook's actually been great for us. People typically don't date on FaceBook. You know, it's -- you're usually talking to people that you already know. Match.com is all about introducing you to people that you don't know. And in fact, FaceBook has become a major source of acquisition for us customer-wise because people are in there engaging socially, and it's been great for us.</p><p>I think another thing that's really great about it is so many more people now are used to uploading their profiles, uploading photos, putting themselves out there because FaceBook has become so ubiquitous that one of the hurdles previously to sort of getting on-line when people weren't use to doing that is now gone. So that -- we really haven't seen it as competition. We've been growing great at the same time they have. So it's been good for us.</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes. You know, and I would think, along those same lines, Greg, is that now that people are more comfortable revealing personal information on line and doing everything from banking on line, and so forth -- because at first, it was taboo to even say that you met somebody or that you were on Match.com.</p><p>BLATT: Right.</p><p>DIAMOND: Now, you know -- that would -- that would hurt your business philosophy, but you know, you kind of -- people are kind of getting away from that, do you think?</p><p>BLATT: Oh, yes. Absolutely. I mean, I'll give you a story. It happens to me all the time. I was just getting set here. Your cameraman told me that he met his wife on Match.com seven years ago.</p><p>DIAMOND: Which cameraman? Mike?</p><p>WILLARD: He just had a baby with that same wife!</p><p>DIAMOND: Oh!</p><p>BLATT: Happens all the time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Thumbs up. There you go.</p><p>DIAMOND: You never told us that!</p><p>BLATT: You know, it happens all the time. My brother just met somebody on Match and he's -- they're moving in together, which made my mother extremely happy.</p><p>WILLARD: I'm all warm inside now!</p><p>BLATT: So it's great. I think the taboo -- look, there's some people who still have a, you know, reluctance to do it...</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>BLATT: ... and that's our growth, right? We continue to -- you know, there are far more single people who are not meeting the number of people and the type of people that they want, doing whatever they do regularly, and Match.com is a great supplement for it. You know, it's not absolution (ph), it's another thing to do in your...</p><p>DIAMOND: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: Greg, we spent a little time on the show earlier, on \"Strategy Room\" -- part of the fascinating thing about Match.com, and I guess all of them, is that you are the one -- you have an algorithm that tells you who would work, in other words, whether Cody would work with that girl over there...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: That's Mary.</p><p>BOLLING: What's that?</p><p>WILLARD: Mary. That's Mary over there.</p><p>BOLLING: Well, OK, anyway, so...</p><p>BLATT: Yes, it's a predictor. It's not -- you know, it's not foolproof, but base it on site (ph) activity and the community and what you do and what they do. We've gotten pretty good at predicting whether or not you guys will connect on line. And then from there, it's -- you know, it's -- guys and girls, or you know, whatever, and they go ahead and they meet.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLATT: We don't try and take the place of nature. We just try and get it going.</p><p>WILLARD: On a similar note, though, I -- how about the app culture? You guys have a Match.com app, obviously, out there. How about -- I mean, am I able to just type in, Hey, who else is in this neighborhood right now from Match.com?</p><p>BLATT: Yes, we've got...</p><p>WILLARD: How far away are you from that?</p><p>BLATT: We've got -- we just launched our BlackBerry app. We've got iPod, Palm free. Android will be coming out soon. And it is geographically based. You can geographically search. There are some issues taking it too far -- safety, privacy, et cetera. So where that ultimately goes, I don't know. But I think, you know, we -- we're going to have a full roll-out there. And it's a great experience because you don't have to be at home. You can do it on the subway or in the doctor's office or...</p><p>DIAMOND: Well, you don't get good connections on the Internet...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: I got to ask you...</p><p>BLATT: The bus. The bus. I'm sorry.</p><p>BOLLING: When you say \"do it,\" you mean contact?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: ... price. You know, have you guys lowered any of your prices? Do you guys have promotions? You know, people are -- money's tight right now.</p><p>BLATT: Yes, I think -- look, there's no recession in love. People are...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLARD: That's the line of the day!</p><p>BLATT: And it's -- you know, it's, like, $4.50 a week. You know, it's really -- it's not a lot of money. And you know, we're always moving prices and stuff. But we haven't seen anything...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: One meal at McDonald's per week.</p><p>BLATT: That's right.</p><p>DIAMOND: If you can't afford that, you can't afford a date, so...</p><p>WILLARD: No recession in love. What a great line.</p><p>DIAMOND: Thanks very much.</p><p>BLATT: OK, thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: On tap, folks...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: Excuse me! Ten plastic surgeries in one day -- not me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DIAMOND: We're talking about 23-year-old TV personality Heidi Montag.</p><p>WILLARD: Nobody thought that was you!</p><p>DIAMOND: Well, you never know. She has come out revealing her new look that has dumbfounded so many people, and she has even said that her own mother looked at her like a circus freak. Plastic surgery gone bad? Bonnie Fuller here at the bar and she has all the latest Hollywoodlife gossip details when we come back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you ever tried on-line dating?</p><p>DIAMOND: I couldn't read the results. What were the results? Have you ever tried on-line dating?</p><p>WILLARD: I missed it, too, but I will check it out.</p><p>DIAMOND: Ten plastic surgeries, and nine weeks later, \"The Hills\" star Heidi Montag has revealed her new look to the world. Have you seen this? Well, she was quoted in \"People\" magazine as saying, \"I wanted to be the most beautiful inside and out. It's part of being a pop star.\" Talk about investing in your career! But what kind of message does this give to young women, especially those aspiring to be actresses and singers?</p><p>We want to welcome Bonnie Fuller, editor-in-chief of Hollywoodlife.com, to try to make some sense out of this. All right, we're looking -- we were talking about this in our morning meeting, looking at the before and after. I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: After wasn't so bad!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BONNIE FULLER, HOLLYWOODLIFE.COM: ... controversial topic!</p><p>DIAMOND: After wasn't terrible.</p><p>FULLER: Oh, really?</p><p>DIAMOND: (INAUDIBLE) now.</p><p>FULLER: You think so?</p><p>WILLARD: Wow.</p><p>FULLER: Oh, I think she looks awful. I mean, she can't move. Yes, she has double Ds now and -- but she can't move. And literally, she tried to smile in one of her interviews, and she couldn't. She couldn't make her mouth go up.</p><p>DIAMOND: That's obviously an old picture.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FULLER: That's her \"pre.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Is that after?</p><p>FULLER: ... attractive young woman, like a beautiful young woman.</p><p>WILLARD: You know, I know we're sort of trying to have a fun segment here, but this just looks like a cry for help. I mean, are we going to look back in 10 years and it's going to be another tragedy from Hollywood?</p><p>FULLER: I think it's a cry for help myself. I don't think that any normal young woman goes through 10 plastic surgery procedures in 10 hours. I think that's dangerous, the plastic surgery, and doesn't tell her parents at all. She actually went home to her mom last week, and it was filmed. It was a film for her show, \"The Hills.\" And her mother told her that she looked like a circus freak. I mean, that is not -- it's not normal, the whole thing. It's not a normal, nice thing for a mom to say, either.</p><p>BOLLING: We've got to get to this because we're going to run out of time. What about the situation and Peyton Manning doing a Super Bowl ad?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: But what -- right, from New Jersey. But what product? We don't know if...</p><p>WILLARD: Abmaster, baby! What do you think?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: Hair gel!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FULLER: I think it's actually promoting the Super Bowl. I mean, what a -- can you believe what's happened?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: ... Super Bowl!</p><p>FULLER: And Peyton Manning.</p><p>BOLLING: I know what it is. It's a vitamin.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Vitamin E for ego. These two have monster egos.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: So now Heidi Montag is inspiration for actresses and singers and this situation an inspiration for football players?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLARD: I got some abs over here, Rebecca!</p><p>FULLER: You have now seen and done it all, Cody!</p><p>DIAMOND: Bonnie...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIAMOND: See you tomorrow, everybody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I continue to focus my efforts on improving the lives of workers and their families, empowering our communities, and strengthening the nation. American workers face many threats from globalization, outsourcing, illegal aliens, coronavirus, and much more. Protecting American workers is my priority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump Visits Yuma</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, I had the great honor to be with President Trump during his visit to Yuma. The President met with our brave Border Patrol agents who provided an update on the construction of the wall and their efforts to keep our communities safe from the threats that illegally flow over the southern border. For too long, administrations ignored the concerns of border communities, and our country has suffered dearly under a debilitating drug crisis and the crime connected with illegal trafficking from Mexico. I have always been a staunch advocate for increasing our security, and I was proud to be with the President as we approach the completion of 300 miles of a border wall. Having a Commander-in-Chief who properly identifies the connectivity between border security and national security is crucial for our nation, and I have taken even more action to elevate this concern, such as fighting recent attempts by House Democrats to provide little, and even no, money for additional security measures.</p><p>Watch a brief video of President Trump meeting with Yuma Border Patrol agents at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11810-442098\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11810-442098</url>.</p><p>Providing Passive Immunity to First Responders and Frontline Workers</p><p>Slow medical responses to the COVID-19 outbreak prove that no nation was truly prepared for this type of virus. For too long, we have shuttered our economy imposing significant damage while Americans battle the health impacts of this virus. President Trump continues to coordinate a federal government and private industry response for a cure. In the meantime, we must find temporary measures to protect our frontline healthcare workers and to reopen the economy. This week, I was happy to assist with connecting first responders and frontline workers in the district with therapeutic responses to coronavirus. Certain passive immunity responses can be applied directly to the body or to PPE, neutralizing coronavirus when it comes in contact with your body for 12 hours. This week I was proud to facilitate the first shipments to Arizona's fourth congressional district's first responders, medical workers, and other front line workers. Solutions like this are the epitome of American innovation and provide a path to reopening our economy and our country.</p><p>You can listen to my interview about passive immunity at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11811-442098\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11811-442098</url>.</p><p>No Amnesty for Big Tech</p><p>Big Tech is continuing to use this crisis to consolidate their monopoly power. I will continue to fight for small businesses whose data and patents are being stolen by Amazon. Amazon has a practice of using Chinese manufacturers to copy U.S. products, then Amazon removes the U.S. products and replaces them with the Chinese products. Because of special immunity granted by Congress, Big Tech has immunity from the application of federal laws that would apply to any other business. Amnesty for the censorship of competition and lawful political speech is unacceptable and I will continue to fight for a vote on my bill, H.R. 7808 Stop the Censorship Act of 2020.</p><p>Efforts to Support Law Enforcement and Reinstate the Rule of Law</p><p>I want to again reiterate my firm disavowal of Antifa and BLM. I do not support either of these Marxist organizations and am working with Republican colleagues and the President to thwart Antifa and BLM's attempts to overthrow our constitutional republic. We must defend our history and Antifa and BLM will not stop with statues. Not only have I been publicly vocal in my condemnation of this illicit activity, but I am involved in several measures to combat the widespread lawlessness continuing in Liberal cities. I have been proud to join my colleagues in the following measures intended to maintain the rule of law.</p><p>H.Res.1071 - expresses sincerest thanks and appreciation to our Nation's law enforcement officers while also rejecting the dangerous efforts to dismantle law enforcement agencies</p><p>No RIOT Act - modernizes the government's riot definition to include organizations' use of modern technology to coordinate riot activity, enhances criminal penalties for assaulting a police officer while rioting, and includes riots and destruction of a veterans' memorial</p><p>H.R. 7643 - protects our national history by ensuring that any person or group involved in the destruction or vandalism of a monument, memorial, or statue is prosecuted and applies the same justice guarantees to any person or organization which incites violence and illegal activities.</p><p>CHOPping Cash for CHAZ Act - combats the ANTIFA inspired autonomous zone in Seattle known as CHAZ and the formation of any other through compelling state and local governments to act against these criminal movements.</p><p>You can watch my comments and the comments of my fellow Freedom Caucus colleagues in June condemning these riots, supporting our law enforcement, and calling to reinstate the rule of law.</p><p>Applying RICO to Antifa and BLM</p><p>This week I am sending a letter to the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to use the existing federal authority provided under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act to combat the commission of crimes and violence by Antifa and BLM. RICO grants the DOJ the ability to combat organized crime units by connecting leaders and formal organizations to individuals committing criminal acts. The law also provides extended criminal penalties and a method for Americans who have had their business or property damaged by these criminals to receive awards for damages, costs, and attorney fees. RICO has been used to combat large national criminal groups such as the mafia, and can easily be applied to current organizations like BLM. Its national leaders must be held accountable for the criminal acts committed by individuals across the nation, and RICO can provide this channel. In this letter, I am encouraging the DOJ to consider criminal and civil cases against Antifa and BLM under the RICO statutes.</p><p>Western Caucus: Securing America's Energy Part II</p><p>As Chairman of the Western Caucus, I recently led Part II of our DC Connect Series: Securing America's Energy. In this event, we were joined by Republican Whip Steve Scalise and Dan Kish from the Institute for Energy Research. This productive conversation addressed two crucial areas. Whip Scalise, who is chair of the House Energy Action Team, spoke to the overlap between its crucial role and the Western Caucus agenda in promoting federal policy which ensures the government is contributing to domestic energy development. Mr. Kish and I spoke of the threat from resourcing our daily energies from countries like Russia and China. Through the DC Connect energy series, the Western Caucus continues to focus on the importance of American energy independence and dominance for our national security, economy, and overall quality of life for the American people.</p><p>Video not playing?</p><p>Watch here:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch\">https://www.youtube.com/watch</url>'v=jGihIPaGMTo</p><p>Kingman Airport Gets Money To Fly High</p><p>I am proud to announce that due to my efforts Kingman Municipal Airport is getting $2.3 million to make runway improvements. Mohave County is poised to grow and it needs an airport that can keep up. These runway improvements will make the airport more capable and safer.</p><p>The grant details can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11818-442098\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11818-442098</url>.</p><p>Surprise Build Grant Letter</p><p>This week, I joined the Arizona delegation on a letter to the Department of Transportation (DOT) in support of the City of Sunrise's BUILD Grant application for the Loop 303 - Litchfield Road Traffic Interchange Project. Sunrise is Arizona's tenth largest city and continues to grow, yet its infrastructure has not matched this expansion. With only a single access point to US 60, no direct access to Loop 303, and recent flooding, Sunrise is susceptible to traffic congestion and slow response in flood incidents and forest fires. The proposed project addresses these issues by building a new traffic interchange on Loop 303, a new roadway from Loop 303 to Happy Valley Road, and a bridge across the McMicken Channel. This project is important for the safety, economic security, and overall quality of life in the region and I am proud to stand with the community and Arizona delegation in support of this grant funding request.</p><p>Dedicating the Lake Havasu City Combat Veterans Memorial Post Office</p><p>Last year President Trump signed my bill, H.R. 3314, which designated the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) facility located at 1750 McCulloch Boulevard North in Lake Havasu City as the Lake Havasu City Combat Veterans Memorial Post Office Building. On Friday, I was proud to attend the official recognition of this USPS facility to honor Lake Havasu's fallen combat veterans. While we can never truly repay the debt to our fallen men and women, this post office will serve as a reminder of their fierce patriotism and bravery. In Western Arizona, we stand proudly in support of our veterans and understand that freedom is not free. Six brave men from Lake Havasu lost their lives fighting for our nation, and countless more from Lake Havasu City have served. I was honored to introduce and pass this bill on their behalf and to oversee the dedication of this post office to our nation's bravest. Please find below the names of six combat veterans from the Lake Havasu City area who lost their lives in service to our nation:</p><p>Carey Dean Harmon, who bravely lost his life fighting the Tet Offensive.</p><p>Scott Broadston, who valiantly fought in Vietnam and lost his life during a combat assault.</p><p>Patrick Tinnell, who was the first from Lake Havasu City to be killed in action during the Global War on Terror.</p><p>Anthony Sausto, who lost his life fighting in Baghdad, Iraq.</p><p>Dylan Reid, who served in Amarah, Iraq, where he died in 2010.</p><p>Carl Hammar, who serviced two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan where he died in combat.</p><p>Increasing Oversight of the Federal Bureaucracy</p><p>Unelected, federal bureaucrats wield an unprecedented amount of power. In fact, its power is directly measured at $1.9 trillion dollars a year, which is the cost imposed on the American people from burdensome regulations, equating to $14,000 per household. It is time for Congress to reassert transparency and oversight. That is why I have introduced the Regulatory Report Card Act, a bill that reinstates this oversight and scales back the regulatory burden on American citizens, businesses, and workers. Each Executive agency and department would receive a letter grade every two years based on its compliance with Congressionally created criteria and its economic impact, such as whether or not it meets President Trump's Executive Order requiring that for every regulation, two must be repealed. Then, each agency must testify before Congress as to why it received the grade it did. The intent is that the federal government meets what we demand from our children, straight A's, to ensure the government is truly working for the American people and not against our best interest.</p><p>A Rare Win in the 9th Circuit</p><p>One of the most important aspects of the Trump Presidency has been appointing conservatives to the Judicial Branch. Recently, because President Trump has been able to mitigate the often disastrous 9th circuit court by appointed judges that struck down California's ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, citing the unconstitutionality. This win underscores the importance of the Trump Presidency and a Republican majority.</p><p>Reminder to Fill Out Your Census!</p><p>The finalization of the Census data collection is fastly approaching. Follow-ups conducted by Census workers will continue throughout this month, however, the Census Bureau recently announced that all collection efforts will end September 30th so the final count can begin. As one of the fastest-growing states in the country, completing your Census by September 30th is crucial to ensuring our state is apportioned with the correct amount of Congressional seats and the necessary amount of federal monetary assistance. The Census ensures your democratic voice is complete, full, and fair as guaranteed by your Constitutional rights. All households were mailed a Census questionnaire in the spring to fill out (black or blue ink!) and mail back. If you no longer have this document or wish to complete it online, please follow these directions for an alternative response.</p><p>Please go to: to fill out the Census questionnaire online.</p><p>If you would like to complete the Census by phone, please go to:.</p><p>If you are mailing in your questionnaire and no longer have the proper return information, please go to:.</p><p>COVID-19</p><p>Go to: for information from the CDC on how to protect yourself and others.</p><p>Go to: for information from the CDC on what to do if you are sick.</p><p>President Trump is asking Congress to issue more directed payment to American families. An estimated 12 million individuals who do not normally file income taxes are still eligible to receive payments. But they only have until October 15, 2020, to submit their information to the IRS through the non-filers portal to get their EIP. For more information contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:CFPBtaxtime@cfpb.gov\">CFPBtaxtime@cfpb.gov</email> In the interim, you can also access the IRS toolkit.</p><p>President Trump recently signed a presidential memorandum to provide temporary payroll tax relief for American families who have been hit hard by the coronavirus, took action to ensure Americans who have lost their job and want nothing more than to return to work have the unemployment benefits they need during this crisis, signed an executive order to help ensure Americans facing financial hardships due to the coronavirus do not face eviction or foreclosure and signed a presidential memorandum to provide student loan relief for Americans who have already faced a financial hit due to the coronavirus. I have been leading the effort for a payroll tax suspension in the House and support President Trump's efforts to provide relief to the American people.</p><p>The White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a document this week showing how President Trump uses the Defense Production Act (DPA) to combat the coronavirus. According to the document, Trump has taken 78 DPA and DPA-related actions since March, including bolstering the supply of N95 respirators and personal protective equipment. They also increased the number of contracts to bring supply chains home.</p><p>I continue to fight for additional relief as necessary. The government imposed shutdown and social distancing guidelines have often empowered large international corporations like Amazon while crushing many AZ-04 businesses, families, and individuals. It is the responsibility of the government to make whole the citizens and their businesses negatively impacted. As the House, Senate, and President Trump propose solutions and negotiate additional relief I have continued to fight for the many requests from the district including but not limited to: suspension of all payroll taxes, suspension of taxes on tips, diverting foreign aid back to American taxpayers, local relief, additions to the Paycheck Protection Program, infrastructure funding, tax deductions for PPE, repeal of the exemption from antitrust laws for the business of health insurance, ensuring resources are not allocated to illegal aliens or wealthy companies looking to exploit this crisis and more. I will continue to fight for necessary relief.</p><p>Maintaining mental health is important during these difficult times. Check-in on your friends, family, and neighbors. We will get through this together.</p><p>Additional Resources</p><p>The Wuhan Coronavirus continues to unfairly burden hardworking Americans. Many have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay essential bills, such as rent and housing. On July 16th, Governor Ducey issued an Executive Order which extends an original order to allow tenants to qualify for a delay in enforcement of eviction actions under certain circumstances. If you are facing financial issues as a result of COVID-19, find here a checklist to see if you qualify for pandemic-related eviction relief. Other resources for rental payment assistance can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11833-442098\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx'ID=11833-442098</url>.</p><p>In these unprecedented times, there are several Arizona and Federal resources available to assist your family. However, as many people in America are looking for assistance, many of these government agencies have been overwhelmed with inquires, slowing their response time. If you are seeking assistance and not receiving timely responses, please do not hesitate to contact my district or Washington D.C. offices. My staff of dedicated caseworkers are here to help.</p><p>Washington D.C.

When he sees his daughter logging into iTunes and his son buying game upgrades on Xbox Live, he just knows his credit card is taking a hammering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As co-founder and chief executive of OmniPay, a Dublin company that processes credit card transactions, he can't complain too much, however: technologies such as iTunes and web gaming are generating \"shedloads of transactions\" online and that's good news for OmniPay. The company, set up in 2000, last year handled about 1.2bn transactions - online and offline - for big banks and payments providers worldwide, including PayPal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deals with a gross value of (EURO)70bn went through the OmniPay online platform, built and run from Clonskeagh in south Dublin. All those 99c iTunes purchases add up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I must activate our web portal and search for my credit card - I bet I'd find all sorts of stuff,\" jokes O'Donoghue, an energetic Dubliner who started his career as a payroll clerk.</p><p>He had a hectic 2012. First Data, a US payments giant, took full control of OmniPay last year, in a deal that valued the company at (EURO)120m.</p><p>O'Donoghue clocked up multiple trips to First Data's headquarters in Atlanta, as well as Singapore, Melbourne and Auckland as OmniPay offices opened in the US and Australia. \"It's going gangbusters. You'd never be bored.\"</p><p>He hasn't exactly eased himself into the new year. OmniPay last week announced 30 new jobs supported by IDA Ireland, bringing its workforce to 200.</p><p>It was one of the first job announcements of 2013. Recruitment has already started and is \"going well\".</p><p>The company is hiring graduates with IT and business skills, including software developers and testers, business analysts and project managers. It expects to fill the positions in six months though O'Donoghue will be disappointed if they aren't well on the way by the end of next month.</p><p>Despite the tricky economic environment, he confidently predicts \"very healthy\" doubledigit growth in transactions this year. PayPal, which operates in 190 countries, recently signed up OmniPay to handle a chunk of its business for another five years.</p><p>O'Donoghue can't comment on the specifics for commercial reasons but describes PayPal as \"a very large client\". HSBC, Wells Fargo and Lloyds TSB are among its other big customers.</p><p>The deeper relationship with First Data, the majority shareholder in OmniPay since 2006, has thrown up opportunities. As part of a review of its strategy for new markets, First Data evaluated all its technologies worldwide. OmniPay's system, which can handle payments in 160 currencies, came out on top.</p><p>First Data is using the Irish technology for a joint venture in India, which will go live this year, and a big push into Latin America. \"Our challenges for this year are clearly set out,\" said O'Donoghue. \"It's a new phase for OmniPay and there are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>O'Donoghue can trace his credit card credentials to his first job, in the finance department of Switzers, the Grafton Street department store, in the 1980s. O'Donoghue went in for a three-month stint after college - and stayed six years. Credit card sales were handled on \"clunkety-clunk\" machines, where retailers took an imprint of a credit card on carbon paper. All the slips were gathered each evening and the data was entered into a system and sent on a disk to a computing firm. The store got a record on a microfiche.</p><p>He recalls working in Switzers on St Stephen's Days, when the thousands of pre-Christmas transactions would have to be manually processed before the store reopened for the sales.</p><p>\"It was a great job. I learnt a lot about the mechanics of a big department store - and a lot about credit cards,\" said O'Donoghue. \"When you come from that, you discover the essence of the problem, and how the solution has to work.\"</p><p>When Brown Thomas bought Switzers in 1990, he went to work for Credit Card Software International, an IT company that set up in Dublin with backing from IDA Ireland. After five years, O'Donoghue moved to Trintech, set up by brothers Cyril and John McGuire to develop payments technology.</p><p>He was a director but left in 1998, a year before Trintech took advantage of dotcom mania to carry out a lucrative listing on the Nasdaq and Neuer Markt in Germany. \"They were pioneers of ecommerce,\" he says.</p><p>O'Donoghue struck out on his own as an IT consultant. His projects included preparing Allied Irish Banks (AIB) for the perils of Y2K.</p><p>Part of a \"Y2K Swat team\", he was tasked with taking money from ATMs in Donnybrook in Dublin after midnight on December 31, 1999. The ATMs worked fine and the night passed off uneventfully.</p><p>\"There were some systems that didn't get the date right but it didn't make a difference. No planes fell from the sky.\"</p><p>At AIB, he met Brian Connolly, a career banker who was head of merchant services. Connolly was preparing to quit the bank and asked O'Donoghue what his plans were.</p><p>They settled on a plan to establish a financial services technology company. \"We put together a high-level business plan and took it around town,\" said O'Donoghue.</p><p>It was a difficult sell. The dotcom bubble had burst, taking some big names with it. Venture capitalists were sceptical.</p><p>Brian McCarthy, the founder of Fexco, a Co Kerry financial services firm, was more receptive. \"He was mustard keen. They put in the capital to get us going, which was a brave move on their part.\"</p><p>Fexco put up IR\u00a34m ((EURO)5.1m) and OmniPay came into being in 2000, with five staff in an office on Ely Place in Dublin city centre. O'Donoghue jokes they were \"too thick\" to know how difficult it would be starting from scratch.</p><p>\"We had a blank sheet of paper. It was a daunting prospect but our greatest weakness was also our greatest strength: we had nothing, so we could leapfrog everyone else.\"</p><p>Card payments were still processed using old mainframe systems with basic user interfaces, the classic green text on a black screen. The arrival of big tech companies in Ireland was the catalyst for change.</p><p>\"AIB got started on multicurrency transactions when Gateway computers came to Ireland.</p><p>People wanted to buy computers from across Europe and there had to be a way to pay for them,\" said O'Donoghue. \"The banks were putting stuff together with tape and string. We just thought there must be a better way.\"</p><p>OmniPay came up with a user-friendly web portal that allowed merchants and banks to log and monitor transactions.</p><p>It was a quantum leap.</p><p>Chase merchant services was the first customer. The contract was small but, crucially, involved handling 20 currencies.</p><p>\"Suddenly we were the multi-currency guys.\"</p><p>Lloyds TSB followed and the relationship with Fexco, which was 25%-owned by First Data, opened doors to banks worldwide.</p><p>OmniPay charged them on a per-transaction basis and benefited from their growth.</p><p>As the industry developed, the company evolved to handle new payments technologies, currencies and regulations. \"We were in a sweet spot in a growing industry.\"</p><p>By 2006, OmniPay had 120 staff and was handling about 500m transactions a year. In August that year, First Data bought out the management stake in the company, making millionaires of the founders.</p><p>O'Donoghue left the business in November that year and returned to consulting. \"The business had reached a natural turn in the road,\" he said.</p><p>Three years later, he returned to OmniPay, lured by the growth prospects of the business.</p><p>In 2010, OmniPay revenues rose 20% to (EURO)36m and the company made a (EURO)16m pre-tax profit. It paid more than (EURO)28m in dividends to shareholders between 2009 and 2010.</p><p>First Data, owned by KKR, the private equity house, has left O'Donoghue largely to his own devices since buying out Fexco's stake last April. \"The last thing they want to do is smother a successful company,\" he said.</p><p>Having seen clunkety-clunk machines, card terminals, chip and pin, online buying and mobile commerce, he is preparing OmniPay for the next wave of innovation. That includes contactless payments and so-called \"u-commerce\" - universal commerce.</p><p>\"When we started out, people were uncomfortable paying for anything over the internet. Now you can make and receive a payment using only a smartphone. The potential is enormous,\" he said.</p><p>\"I'm very excited about the future. It's a fun business. I love it.\" Except when it's his credit card taking the hit, of course.</p><p>The life of Hubert O'Donoghue Age: 48 Home: Malahide, Dublin Family: Married with two children, aged 17 and 13 Education: CBS Westland Row, Dublin; BA in economics and French from University College Dublin Favourite film: The Magnificent Seven, pictured Favourite book: I like reading practical philosophy but there's some woeful rubbish out there WORKING DAY I spend about a third of my time travelling to other markets around the world. If I am in Ireland, I'm up and out early to get to the office in Clonskeagh. Some days I take a fold-up bike on the Dart and cycle up from Sandymount. I try not to be in the office until all hours of the night, so I sometimes take conference calls at home.</p><p>DOWNTIME I enjoy rugby very much. I'm a Leinster Rugby season-ticket holder and my son is a keen rugby player, so I spend a lot of my downtime on the highways and byways driving him to matches. I have a little boat in Howth and do a bit of sailing. I go to the gym twice a week - between the travel and the job, you have to leave some time for your health.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>O'Donoghue has gone from payroll clerk to boss of a company valued at (EURO)120m</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>BRYAN MEADE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-68106962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57GS-FYN1-DY9P-N0GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 13, 2013 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00025PV</classCode><className>FIRST DATA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

That`s another...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, why did he break out and say, yes, he`s being investigated, and said so twice?</p><p>PAGE: You got me.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Glenn, does it got you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLENN THRUSH, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Let me make this perfectly clear...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Crystal clear!</p><p>THRUSH: Crystal clear.</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s playing Tom Cruise in \"A Few Good Men.\" All I know is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>THRUSH: Sean Spicer must have sat and watched that and been, like, I do much better than this!</p><p>MATTHEWS: (INAUDIBLE) better than that guy!</p><p>THRUSH: Spicer at least has his stock line, which is, you know, \"The tweet speaks for itself.\"</p><p>MATTHEWS: Like (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>THRUSH: No, yes, well, that -- no he never -- doesn`t say that, but he`s - - the tweet speaks for itself, right.</p><p>MATTHEWS: What do you make of it, Phil?</p><p>PHIL RUCKER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": The fact of the matter is, Chris, is he is being investigated. The president is being investigated. That`s what my colleagues at \"The Washington Post\" have been reporting since last week. The special counsel is looking into this. Just because Sekulow and the legal team have not been given an official notice that he`s under investigation doesn`t mean that the special counsel...</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let`s go back to a few theories. I counted four reasons to try to figure out why this guy, Sekulow, was sicced out there as a mouthpiece for Trump and why he was told to say, even though he couldn`t stick to it, he`s not under investigation.</p><p>One, it`s possibly true, he`s not -- possibly. Everything`s possible. Look at the jury in the -- up there in Pennsylvania. Anything is possible.</p><p>Number two, he wants to just push back from it because it`s a better position to be in that you`re not being investigated, at least publicly, because it makes you look a little bit guilty.</p><p>Three, he`s trying to trigger some crazy reaction by the prosecutor`s office, something leaked to one of you guys or something, that will look (ph) them look overwrought or whatever -- I think the last one was Trump likes to hear a guy on television say he`s innocent. He just likes to hear that, and he paid a guy to say it.</p><p>PAGE: And you know, I think that...</p><p>MATTHEWS: You think he`s doing it just to fluff Trump.</p><p>PAGE: I think it was an audience of one. I think he was speaking to an audience of one.</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s a lot of money to pay.</p><p>PAGE: Well, you know, I mean, if he`s not being investigated, why are all these lawyers are getting hired?</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s lawyered up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I want to get to that question. Why is he going to lawyering, rather than defending himself politically? Why is he going and turning -- is it because the bar`s so high for impeachment that if he can just stick to the law and ignore all the misbehavior, failure to be a president of the United States, as we expect him to be, if he can change the topic to terrible behavior as president, to, Can we put him in jail for this, he can win that argument.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chris, I mean, let`s not forget. Sekulow is the guy who came out last weekend, I think, and suggested that the president was thinking about firing Mueller as the special counsel, right? The problem is, and we saw this when Kasowitz gave his performance at the Press Club, which I was fortunate enough to attend, the line between lawyer and flack in this case is really thin, sometimes as to be nonexistent. And I think you saw something...</p><p>MATTHEWS: He sounded like a flack yesterday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... saw something really interesting today that my paper reported that Kushner -- and Kushner and -- Kushner has essentially been the most canny in terms of getting out ahead of this. He is considering hiring Abbe Lowell, who you know quite well, as a potential criminal defense lawyer. Not saying there`ll be a criminal case brought, but I think...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Who wants to hire Abbe Lowell?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: <person><nameText>Jared Kushner </nameText></person>is considering...</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s already got Jamie Gorelick!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, he`s considering -- he`s considering adding Lowell to the team or having him replace Gorelick. The bottom line here...</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think the guy should never have been approved. I think they should have stuck to the nepotism law in the beginning. The wouldn`t -- because a reason for nepotism laws, whether they`re still effective or not, is you avoid problems like this.</p><p>THRUSH: The other thing is I just don`t think -- and Phil can back me up on this. I don`t think there`s a sufficient enough appreciation, particularly at the mid level, mid and lower levels in the White House, what this investigation really means. I don`t think the president is necessarily taking it all that serious, in terms of his legal team.</p><p>RUCKER: And the president`s treating it like a political campaign. The approach from the lawyers is not a legal response, it`s a political response. It`s to discredit the special counsel and the integrity of the investigation, but it`s also to discredit the news media that are reporting details and news and scoops about the investigation by talking about anonymous sources.</p><p>MATTHEWS: What about -- what about Newt Gingrich, who always seems to come back like the Joker, back saying the president can`t be indicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office, or even obstruction of justice because for him to do it -- it`s like Nixon talking. If I do it, it`s legal.</p><p>PAGE: Well, the -- I think there is a legal debate, and the view of the Department of Justice before this administration was that you can`t indict the president because if there`s something the president`s done that is so terrible, the remedy is impeachment.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s take a look at it. Here`s Trump ally Newt Gingrich defending the president Friday, saying the mere fact that he is president means he cannot obstruct justice. Different -- this is different than saying he can`t be indicted.</p><p>PAGE: (INAUDIBLE) exactly.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s see what he says, how he says it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Technically, the president of the United States cannot obstruct justice. The president of the United States is the chief executive officer of the United States. If he wants to fire the FBI director, all he`s got to do is fire him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, back in 1998, Newt, when Newt Gingrich voted to impeach President Bill Clinton partly on charges of obstruction of justice, he had a very different take on the issue. Let`s watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINGRICH: What you have lived through for two-and-a-half long years is the most systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice cover-up and effort to avoid the truth we have ever seen in American history. And the time has come to say to the Democrats and to say to the president, Quit undermining the law in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You know, Tim Russert, the great man himself -- and he was great -- he would always keep a manila folder here and wait well into the interview and just open it up and say, You said -- let`s take a look it, and it was going to the tapes.</p><p>And (INAUDIBLE) it doesn`t seem to matter anymore, guys. You can say that Newt is speaking, as they used to say in the cowboy movies, with a forked tongue. It doesn`t seem to matter. You can say a president can`t obstruct justice. He just said he could. But doesn`t anything hold true for more than a couple of minutes anymore?</p><p>PAGE: Well, it may be true that Newt Gingrich isn`t held to account for these conflicting statements, but the fact is we have a legal system that is to some degree impervious to this political debate. And I think that`s what a lot of people are counting on, that there`s going to be -- the special counsel is going to investigate. It`s going to find what it`s going to find, and we`ll see what it is. And some of this political debate is either irrelevant or even harmful to the president`s case. You know, there are cases where the president...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Will it matter in a court of justice and this House of Representatives if an impeachment proceeding begins in the House Judiciary Committee and they`re presented with this kind of evidence of dishonesty?</p><p>PAGE: Well...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Does it matter that Trump has been saying five different things on one subject?</p><p>PAGE: Well, something like the Lester Holt interview could rebound against the president`s interests because there he says that he was...</p><p>MATTHEWS: It was about Russia.</p><p>PAGE: He said the decision to fire Comey was about Russia.</p><p>MATTHEWS: (INAUDIBLE) because that sounds like obstruction of justice. Yes?</p><p>THRUSH: Look who`s defending the president on air, people who are paid to do it. At the moment, we don`t have that many surrogates. Newt Gingrich, who appears to have just floated from the ether down in front of a camera to defend the president -- he`s hawking a Trump book. Newt Gingrich has, you could argue, a financial interest in allying himself with the president right now.</p><p>MATTHEWS: His wife has been appointed ambassador to the Vatican.</p><p>RUCKER: And the people who are paid...</p><p>MATTHEWS: This -- these are interesting sociometric overlays!</p><p>RUCKER: And the people paid to defend the president at the White House won`t even answer any questions about the Russia matter because they`re worried about their own legal exposure. They`re worried about saying something that`s not true and having it come back to bite them in the end.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s watch this. There`s some news out tonight. It keeps coming. Michael Flynn -- this comes from McClatchy News Service, and other news organizations. According to McClatchy, however, quote, \"Former national security adviser Michael Flynn appears to have failed to report a 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia on behalf of a U.S./Russian business plan to build nuclear reactors there, according to a congressional letter issued today, Monday, requesting documents from the companies he allegedly represented.\"</p><p>This guy is a busy little bee, isn`t he, Flynn? And he`s so busy, he can`t even remember how many clients he`s got overseas, when the one thing you have to sign in any kind of national security document or check is how many foreign bosses do you have because it`s nice to know that when you put somebody in charge of our country`s security. Your thoughts?</p><p>PAGE: Well, my thought is...</p><p>MATTHEWS: I mean, he`s Turkey. He`s got the Saudis. He`s got the Russians.</p><p>PAGE: So if you don`t report all this, do you assume it will just never come out? Because a lot of other people know it, right? The companies know it. Your enemies know it. Your competitors know it...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>PAGE: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It shows up. Glenn?</p><p>THRUSH: I don`t know when his birthday is, but I`m going to get him a day planner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: No, you know, it`s a problem for Trump because the more this guy gets in deep with dishonesty and failure to file -- these are all felony charges...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the...</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... the deeper evidence he has to produce to save his butt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the biggest...</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s got to come up with something that will really tell the prosecutors and the Congress, If I give you this, I can go home tonight and have dinner with my family. If not, I go to some horrible place like, you know, San Quentin for about two decades.</p><p>THRUSH: I would say it`s probably closer to Connecticut. But I mean...</p><p>MATTHEWS: No, maybe closer to somewhere in Pennsylvania, Lewisberg.</p><p>THRUSH: Look, I think the thing with Flynn -- and you hear this from the lawyers when they speak more candidly -- is people are worried that he`s already flipped for the congressional committees. And I think anyone who had interactions with Flynn -- and we should just point out my paper has reported Flynn was essentially hired by Jared and Ivanka, who asked him what job he wanted, and he said national security.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let`s go through what`s left. I`ve been trying to -- people jump on me because they say I`m exonerating Trump. I`m just trying to get to the heart of this thing. Comey in his testimony the other day said, Well, the thing about dealing with -- with Flynn is separate from the Russia investigation. So I thought, Oh, my -- he`s not involved with the Russia investigation with possible collusion? And then he -- and then Trump said that Manafort was sort of a satellite out there, somebody you can throw from the bus or under the bus.</p><p>And I said, Well, who`s left? And I couldn`t think of anybody. It couldn`t be Carter what`s-his-name...</p><p>PAGE: Page.</p><p>THRUSH: Page.</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... because I didn`t think he was serious enough to do anything bad or good in life. That`s just my view of the guy. And I didn`t think it was going to be Roger Stone because he`s always sort of vaguely flying around any trouble area. But then I didn`t think of Kushner. And I think if there`s one guy the president would go down for, or defend to the last, it`s his son-in-law because of his daughter. And he gave him such a wide berth in terms of who he could talk to -- he`s now given him the Middle East maybe to cover himself.</p><p>Is there any -- where is the fertile area where there could have been collusion, through what person? To What person? Susan?</p><p>PAGE: Well, he may...</p><p>MATTHEWS: What`s left? I`m just -- people think I`m clearing the -- clearing -- what do you call it, clearing. I`m not clearing. I`m trying to find out where is the area that should be investigated now?</p><p>PAGE: But -- you mean in terms of Trump`s...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, who was his surrogate to deal with the Russians?</p><p>THRUSH: I think the issue is -- you have a lot of disconnected threads here. The one thing we know is that the Russians really wanted to have an influence and they tried to exert influence. It`s clear that they had some interaction, certainly with Flynn, certainly with Manafort, perhaps with Stone. The question is...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Influence with...</p><p>THRUSH: Influence in terms of having relationships, meeting people, getting hookups. The question here...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Because they were paying their way.</p><p>THRUSH: Right. The one thing is we have two sides -- I view it as two sides of a bridge that are moving towards each other. You have the Russians attempting to reach, and then you have the questions about Kushner`s business dealings, and for instance, his financing of 666 Fifth Avenue, the Kushner Properties...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Where did that money come from?</p><p>THRUSH: The belief is through a number of banks, including a lot of Chinese investors. A lot of these are opaque questions. They could turn out to be innocuous questions.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But it was a critical need for him...</p><p>THRUSH: Right.</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... to get that financing.</p><p>THRUSH: But we have the Russian end, the Russian push end of this very well established. The question, I think -- the huge unanswered questions are in terms of the business relationships and in terms of the political motivations of people higher up the food chain than Roger Stone.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But doesn`t there have to be an overlay between the money and the politics and affecting U.S. policy -- in other words, abusing your office and your position politically to make money?</p><p>THRUSH: I think the facts that needs to establish that -- this is why what these congressional -- we had better make sure, and I`m sure everyone agrees, that these congressional investigations are -- really in a lot of ways are as fundamentally important as the FBI.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, let`s hope they get to the pay dirt. Thank you, Susan Page. Thank you, Glenn Thrush. And thank you, Philip Rucker.</p><p>Coming up -- amid the swirl of the Russian investigation, why is rural America so far sticking with <person><nameText>President Trump? </nameText></person>It`s an interesting political question, don`t you think? And that`s ahead.</p><p>Plus, dirty tricks down in Georgia. Take a look at a new ad a Republican group is running ahead of tomorrow`s special congressional election down there. It exploits last week`s shooting that injured Congressman Steve Scalise. Let`s watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans. When will it stop? It won`t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, there you got it. That`s pretty dirty. We`ll have the latest on that race being watched nationally.</p><p>And Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is pushing for a vote on health care, believe it or not, before the 4th of July break. That`s within in the next week. So -- so far, there`s no legislation, no committee hearings, no score from the Congressional Budget Office, but they want to do this fast. And Democrats have taken over the floor of the Senate in protest right now against the quickieness (ph) of this thing.</p><p>Finally, let me finish tonight with \"Trump Watch.\" He won`t like it.</p><p>This is HARDBALL, where the action is.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, as the investigation into Trump and Russia gets deeper and deeper into the White House, the president`s son-in-law and senior adviser -- there he is, <person><nameText>Jared Kushner </nameText></person>-- is heading to the Middle East to try to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that Kushner will arrive in Israel Wednesday. He`ll meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then travel to Ramallah to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. A White House official told \"The Journal\" that no major breakthroughs are expected during the trip.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>Despite his embattled presidency so far, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has maintained residual strength from a core base of supporters who put him over the top of course last November in the Electoral College.</p><p>A report by Dan Balz in \"The Washington Post\" today reveals the depth of support for Trump among rural Americans, noting that -- quote -- \"More sparsely populated areas of the country form the heart of Trump nation, and continue to provide majority support for a president who has faced near constant controversy and discord.\"</p><p>According to a new \"Washington Post\"/Kaiser Foundation poll, the widening political divide in this country falls largely along geographic lines. While the president is facing a net negative overall approval rating, a majority of Americans living in rural areas say they approve of the job he`s doing.</p><p>It`s the same people who Trump often referred to as the forgotten Americans on the campaign trail. Let`s watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`re fighting for every forgotten man, woman, and child of this nation. I`m asking you to dream big. We used to dream big.</p><p>I see you, I hear you, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise. We will never let you down.</p><p>I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. I will be your voice. I`m going to be your voice.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, among those who turned out for him last November, concern over Trump`s signature issue of immigration remains high. Six in 10 rural Trump voters say the immigrants are a burden on this country because they take jobs away from deserving Americans.</p><p>I`m joined right now by Republican strategist, John Brabender and Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher.</p><p>It does seem to me, and much as I work with so many progressives I like them and I listen to their thoughts and I think about the same things, and yet I know from my own family there are people who like Trump, and we keep losing sight of them, especially on the East Coast, and the so-called Left Coast. We forget they`re there, but they`re there, and that the issues that drove them into Trump`s camp, illegal immigration, loss of manufacturing jobs and stupid-ass wars, are still there in their minds, plus some other issues like they -- the part I wasn`t ready for is the hatred of Hillary.</p><p>That seemed to be kept in their heads and in their mouths longer than I thought. So, only after, right near the election, I said, what`s wrong with that? And I would be hearing this, I hate Hillary, I hate Hillary. No exact reason. Just part of it, just that answer.</p><p>Is that all still there?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... saying I hate -- every couple weeks, Trump takes a cheap shot at Hillary, a late hit, if you will.</p><p>JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: First of all, it doesn`t hurt.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And he does it regularly enough for me to say, it doesn`t have anything to do with the conversation. So he says just to remind them, his voters, what side they`re on.</p><p>BRABENDER: Well, first of all, you say on the show a lot it was a binary choice, not just <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And among...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: There was only two choices.</p><p>BRABENDER: And among this group, it could not have been a bigger divide in the choices. Second of all...</p><p>MATTHEWS: You mean they might have voted for Joe Biden?</p><p>BRABENDER: They didn`t vote for Mitt Romney in the numbers they voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>which I thought, in places like Ohio, if you look at the difference, they`re amazing. Where you have got to be careful, though, it`s not...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... percent spread for Trump in those areas over Hillary.</p><p>BRABENDER: Right.</p><p>But it`s not geography, as much as it is culture. What they believe, what they care about is different. The second big difference, too, is how they get their news is different. They are much more reliant on local news, local newspapers.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But local news don`t cover national events.</p><p>BRABENDER: They do, but they don`t editorialize as much as...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Where do they do it? What pages do you have to look through? Most local pages are a combination of wire service copy. You know that. They can`t afford a national reporter in Washington. So, where do they get the news locally? Out of a newspaper?</p><p>BRABENDER: But they come up with the analysis themselves. They will get the news, but they`re not listening to talking heads all the time telling them what they should believe.</p><p>The problem this town...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You`re talking off your head right now, by the way. The talking head phrase always bothers me. Is there another part of your body you would like to talk out of?</p><p>Go ahead, Cornell.</p><p>BELCHER: This Kaiser poll, I think, is an important poll. And I think...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Do you believe what he just said about people locally in rural areas rely on their local newspaper, their local TV affiliate?</p><p>BELCHER: I do believe -- and I want to double down on his point about sort of culture and I want to go after sort of the Democrats` blind spot here.</p><p>Look, what this poll shows is that there`s not actually a lot of connection between the jobs and economic concerns and their support for Trump. This poll has found it and other polls have found it. It is a lot about culture when you look at how concerned they actually are about immigration, the changing face of America, and this assault on -- they feel, on Christianity. That`s what`s driving these conversations.</p><p>MATTHEWS: They want the America they grew up in.</p><p>BELCHER: And there`s a huge disconnect here with Democrats when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says, I`m going to give you your country back, and Democrats say, I`m going to raise your wage, right? Democrats are disconnected from the cultural and aspirational element here.</p><p>And until we start having that conversation about what America has to look like coming into the future, Democrats will continue to struggle with rural Americans.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK. Let me try something with you, both of you, because I think you will agree with this.</p><p>Hollywood, the news business is very careful about gender identity, about sexuality. We are very careful in the language we use, very careful of LGBT concerns generally.</p><p>Do you ever see that same sensitivity about white working-class people? I grew up in a country that made fun of those people. Archie Bunker was that guy. Hollywood greatly enjoyed making fun of this guy. He was probably Irish, but they didn`t say so. He lived in Queens.</p><p>BRABENDER: Yes, I was going to say that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: So, I think Hollywood made a point of enjoying that difference in a way that got to them. And they said, OK, do you want me to be Archie Bunker? I`m voting Republican this time. I will stick with you guys. Am I right or not?</p><p>BRABENDER: Yes, I think you ought to be careful to sort of equate them with Archie Bunker. I think...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Archie Bunker is a fictitious character.</p><p>BRABENDER: I understand that.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Who created him?</p><p>BRABENDER: But we lose the context within the Beltway what these real people are like.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: They live in the country, as well as in...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: OK. I will give you one really good stat from the poll that they released today; 64 percent of the rural voters said that the government programs that are there to help people either hurt them or do nothing; 64 percent said they`re more likely...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: So, a lot of people believe that welfare stunts your growth economically, because you begin to rely it on too much. Everybody -- a lot of people believe that, I think.</p><p>BELCHER: I think it`s an oversimplification, the Archie Bunker thing.</p><p>Look, I come from a generation of people who lived minstrels, right? So, my ears sort of perk up the idea that we`re making fun of rural Americans.</p><p>But we have to take their concerns about their fears about changing America...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Both can be true. Making fun of black people, having people with big white mouth, that kind of stuff, having black people play black people as minstrels, and white people playing -- that was awful.</p><p>BELCHER: I think Stepin Fetchit vs. Archie Bunker, I think there`s a world of difference between the two.</p><p>MATTHEWS: How so?</p><p>BELCHER: One is...</p><p>MATTHEWS: In terms of the person...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELCHER: One is completely degrading of their intellect.</p><p>You can watch Archie Bunker and actually see some intellect there and some understanding there, as opposed to the degradation of black images that was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You beat me on that, because I have been watching these all my life. And let me tell you something. You watch a Hitchcock movie, the only black face are the Pullman cart guys.</p><p>And, sometimes, the movies, the only black face is the guy scared to death of the ghost. Right?</p><p>BELCHER: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... don`t fail me, and all that stuff.</p><p>BELCHER: And that`s my point. It`s dehumanizing, right? The black male...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: It is worse. You`re right. You`re right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: But it still offends the person being targeted.</p><p>BRABENDER: Don`t forget, this is the same group that President Obama said, these are the group that`s clinging to their guns and their religion.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And Hillary said deplorables.</p><p>BRABENDER: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: And your guy said 47 percent.</p><p>BRABENDER: But they celebrate that. They celebrate their religion. They celebrate...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Of course. I go to church. I don`t like that stuff, putting down people who go to church, as if it`s some sort of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: And we shouldn`t.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELCHER: But, also, we spend -- we spend a lot of time talking about the concerns of rural voters. And we should be concerned about rural voters.</p><p>But also let`s understand that Hillary did not lose this election because of a growth in the rural vote.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, there`s 26 percent increase.</p><p>BELCHER: Because she lost it -- if she performs with millennials the same percentages that Barack Obama performed, she wins all four of those states.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s an argument. That`s a good political argument, Cornell. I know your politics.</p><p>BELCHER: It`s math.</p><p>MATTHEWS: No, the other way is also true.</p><p>BELCHER: It`s the math. He has less of a percentage than Mitt Romney does...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Why did he get such a better Republican vote than anyone else has got in the Republican column?</p><p>BELCHER: He is giving them exactly what they want. And that is their country back.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, that`s right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: His message was better. But Hillary is the quintessential of what they don`t like about Washington.</p><p>BELCHER: But he also did worse among better-educated white voters. So, it`s a wash. Yes. He did worse among better-educated -- especially better-educated younger white voters.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Look, Hillary is supposed to carry the suburbs of Philly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: And she lost she only lost by 180 -- won by 180. I`m telling you, the numbers were off in the suburbs and in the rural areas. They were off.</p><p>BELCHER: It was off with -- yes, but she still wins if she holds the Obama coalition. If she performed -- take Michigan, for example.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You`re just making an argument here. You want that to be the coalition.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELCHER: If she gets what Barack Obama gets...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You`re trying to get more young people to vote. It`s a good cause. It`s not the reason why she lost.</p><p>BELCHER: Yes, it is.</p><p>BRABENDER: But Trump won Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Real states.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELCHER: Yes, yes. And you know what he got in Florida? He got 49 percent. You know what Mitt Romney got in Florida? He got 49 percent and lost. It wasn`t about what he did. It was what Democrats did not do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: Those are some pretty big states to win.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELCHER: Forty-nine percent is -- math is math.</p><p>MATTHEWS: The smart Democratic move is to get more votes next time.</p><p>Thank you, John Brabender. And thank you, Cornell Belcher. I think we can agree on that.</p><p>Up next -- get them where you can get them.</p><p>Up next: dirty tricks in Georgia, not this way, of course. Republicans must be getting desperate over tomorrow`s special election down there. Why else are we seeing an accusing -- an ad accusing Democrats of cheering last week`s shooting at that baseball practice?</p><p>This is HARDBALL, where the action is.</p><p>MILISSA REHBERGER, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: I`m Milissa Rehberger. Here`s what`s happening.</p><p>Otto Warmbier, the American student released from a North Korean prison camp in a coma, has died. In a statement, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>condemned the brutality of the North Korean regime and offered his condolences to the family.</p><p>The United States is also condemning the deadly van attack near a London mosque targeting Muslim worshipers.</p><p>And sources say Paris police were the intended targets in a car attack today. The motorist was killed after plowing his vehicle into a police convoy heading down the Champs Elysees -- back to HARDBALL.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Isn`t it great, the communist North Koreans let the kid come home to die? What a terrible, terrible tragedy for that family, all the way through, a bad, bad government.</p><p>Anyway, welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>Democrats are looking to put a big win on the board in tomorrow`s run-off for Georgia 6th Congressional District. The race pits political neophyte and Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff against Republican Karen Handel and is already the most expensive congressional race in history.</p><p>A RealClearPolitics average, by the way, of most recent polls has Ossoff up at 49, Handel at 47, well within the margin of error. Republicans have held the 6th Congressional District for nearly 40 years, until Tom Price vacated the seat to become secretary of health and human services.</p><p>Anyway, the unprecedented nature of the race has become a proxy for the country`s political divide. An organization called Principle PAC, unlikely, which is supporting Karen Handel, released an ad linking Jon Ossoff to last week`s shooting in Virginia which left four wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise.</p><p>Let`s watch this terrible ad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NARRATOR: Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans. When will it stop? It won`t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, both Handel and Ossoff have condemned the ad, but over the weekend, \"The Washington Post\" quoted the chairman of the Republican Party in Georgia`s 11th District as saying -- quote -- \"I think the shooting is going to win the election for us, because moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism.\"</p><p>Well, he later apologized for making those remarks.</p><p>For the latest on what`s happening in Georgia, I`m joined by Greg Bluestein, who is a political reporter for \"The Atlanta Journal- Constitution,\" a great newspaper.</p><p>You know, in NBA basketball or in college basketball, it seems like you can tell the team that`s losing because they start to foul, anything to get the ball back. And I think that metaphor is rich here. Why would any ally of Handel put out an ad that`s so obviously unfair?</p><p>GREG BLUESTEIN, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\": Yes, probably to get attention and to get some fund-raising for that super PAC.</p><p>Both candidates and campaigns have disavowed that ad and said they have nothing to do with it, and both of them have called for it to be taken down, but it remains the talk of the town really in the 6th District.</p><p>The beginning of it with those jarring gunshots really gets your attention.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It seems to me, from an outsider, and just check me on this, that the only way that Handel can win, coming up from the pack of having gotten the plurality of the Republican side in the primary, the only way she can win is to have a tremendous upsurge of total voters, because you have to have voters who didn`t vote the first time around, because they almost gave it 50 percent to Ossoff.</p><p>So, is that what`s happening now? Are there a lot more voters to show up that could help Handel win?</p><p>BLUESTEIN: Yes, I mean, the big turnout, that`s the big question, is how much turnout will help Karen Handel?</p><p>Because we`re already looking at probably well above 200,000 voters, well above the April 18 round.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Wow.</p><p>BLUESTEIN: Yes, 140,000 voters have already cast ballots, which is by far the biggest in a special election.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Unbelievable.</p><p>BLUESTEIN: And Handel is really trying to just keep her base. If she can keep the GOP base, if she can get 90, 95 percent of that GOP base, she will win it.</p><p>Jon Ossoff is talking to two audiences. He`s talking to liberal Democrats and he`s talking to disaffected moderates and independents, who might otherwise vote for Republicans. But maybe they`re turned on by his message about both parties being corrupt and complicit.</p><p>MATTHEWS: How is his message of I`m not really an ideologue selling?</p><p>BLUESTEIN: Yes, it depends, because, as I said, it`s kind of a two-tone message.</p><p>To liberal Democrats, he`s still saying, I`m the guy who can stand up to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>To more moderates, he`s saying, I`m the guy who can cut wasteful spending. So, that could be a path for other Democrats who are running in these fast-changing suburban districts now held by Republicans to win next year, or we could find out tomorrow that that is just not it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think I just saw you in the picture. You just showed up in our picture, by the way.</p><p>Anyway, I want to ask you a question. Are we going to get a simple count tomorrow night? Is it paper ballots? Is it some kind of machine that makes sense, that we will actually get a result tomorrow evening?</p><p>BLUESTEIN: I hope. But I have a feeling I will be working until 3:00 a.m. Wednesday, and my wife will kill me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK. Thank you so much, Greg Bluestein of the great newspaper \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\"</p><p>Up next: Republicans are pushing for a quick vote on health care this week or next, but, so far, everything they`re doing has been behind closed doors and now Democrats are on the floor of the Senate fighting back. They want to know what`s in this package.</p><p>You`re watching HARDBALL, where the action is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it. Make no mistake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>That was <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>of course, in his victory celebration for House Republicans after passing their health care bill last month. But fast forward this to last week, when the president called the bill, the bill he was bragging on there, mean in a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans. Anyway, a group of those Republicans are now working on their own version behind closed doors of a Senate health care overhaul. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it`s time to act.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: Our goal here is to move forward quickly. The status quo is unsustainable. We all know something has to be done. Something has to be done soon. And everybody is participating who wants to and the idea is to get enough votes to pass it. Unfortunately, it will have to be a Republicans-only exercise. But we`re working hard to get there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Reports say McConnell hopes to have a vote on the bill before the July 4th recess, which starts next week, but there`s no written text and no guarantee Republicans will have the 50 votes needed to pass anything.</p><p>Senate Democrats are preparing to go to war, starting tonight with an all- night talkathon. There you see Bernie Sanders making his case with the quote marks there on the Senate floor.</p><p>And here`s Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the floor today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: The Republicans are writing their health care bill under the cover of darkness because they`re ashamed of it, plain and simple. But if Republicans won`t relent and debate their health care in the bill open for the American people to see, they shouldn`t expect business as usual in the Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s bring in the HARDBALL roundtable. Yamiche Alcindor is a national reporter for \"The New York Times\", Shannon Pettypiece is White House correspondent for \"Bloomberg News\", and David Corn is Washington bureau chief for \"Mother Jones\".</p><p>In order, it takes 50 votes with the president to get something to the conference, with the House, to make this thing keep moving forward. They can only afford to lose two votes, right?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We understand there`s two women, especially, Murkowski of Alaska and Collins of Maine. I`m sure different points of the map there who are having a problem with this. We also hear there`s two conservatives, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, ready to vote against it too, too. How do they get 50?</p><p>What`s McConnell up to except getting this behind him, even if it means losing? Getting it over with?</p><p>ALCINDOR: He wants to go on with something else. He wants to go up to a vote, because he wants to be able to put people on the record. And also, I think it`s hard to get to 50 votes because of the two people, you have these two outliers while the Republican Party is one party by name.</p><p>MATTHEWS: On either end.</p><p>ALCINDOR: Yes, on either end. So, you have this party that they`re the same party in name, but in reality, they have very different interests. And you have a lot of Republicans, I would say, who are also very scared about the Medicaid expansion part. You have a lot of people who are dealing with opioid crisis --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Because working poor people who are better than the poverty level, the ones that most people sort of identify, and really care about people, because they`re doing their best, but they`re not quite able to make it. They`re getting knocked off of health care?</p><p>ALCINDOR: Yes, and let`s not add to the fact that, of course, as you said, called it mean. So, we know -- they know that if this somehow turns against people and people start turning against this, the president will say, well, that was really Congress` bill and they didn`t do exactly what I said. So, the political capital is also something --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Shannon, make a call here. How many Republicans --</p><p>SHANNON PETTYPIECE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: This is coming like they`re Vietnam. And even if you somehow thread the needle to get this through the Senate, then you`ve got to get it to the House. It`s such a quagmire they`re in and they want to get out of it so bad.</p><p>And I think to your point, McConnell, I mean, normally, you never take a bill to the House if you don`t have to votes, or to the floor. Maybe you`re going to take it to the floor, let it die, blame Obama for the rest of it and move on to tax reform which is what the Republicans want.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, David, you start. How many votes would a repeal vote get? Simple, straight repeal? We`re getting rid of this, what they consider socialism. It`s over with. But again, 30 votes in the Senate? How many would it get?.</p><p>DAVID CORN, MOTHER JONES: Maybe the 30 to 40 range. It wouldn`t be majority.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, but in other words, the bulk of the Republican Party is against health care. Is that fair?</p><p>CORN: Yes, your point is that this is not about policy, this is about politics. Can anyone here name what this bill will do? How this bill will make health care better for people? It`s all about getting rid of Obamacare, which means politically, it`s about serving the base. Because Mitch McConnell, he`s one of the leaders of the Republican Party, they control both houses. Trump`s in the White House.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, you made the point. What they really want is a vote on the record that says, then what I go back to Utah, or they go back to Wyoming and says, I voted to get rid of Obamacare.</p><p>CORN: But they don`t want to lose this vote, too.</p><p>MATTHEWS: They`re probably going to lose it.</p><p>ALCINDOR: But their problem -- but the part of this politics is people are going to remember who took away their health care. There`s not just this idea that you can just go out there and vote and say, OK, well --</p><p>MATTHEWS: But aren`t a good number of conservative states, is that still the smart move?</p><p>ALCINDOR: It`s still a smart move for some people who make --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota.</p><p>ALCINDOR: They actually realize that they have now lost their health care because of their senator. They`re going to turn against the Republicans --</p><p>CORN: Yes, there are real-world ramifications of this.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Why is it so hard to get a bill together if they do want to save something like Obamacare?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You guys are making two points. Do you want to get rid of health care or fix it? What is it? Fix it or get rid of it?</p><p>ALCINDOR: I think they want to fix it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, then, that`s explained. They don`t want to get rid of it.</p><p>PETTYPIECE: I think they want to repeal Obamacare.</p><p>MATTHEWS: They don`t want to fix it. Can you help me here? Fix it or repeal, what do they most want to do? She says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CORN: Repeal.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Huh?</p><p>CORN: They want to get rid of it, that`s number one priority.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I`m with you. I think -- I think this is very complicated for a party that`s normally -- some normal Republicans in it, and some abnormal Republicans. It`s very complicated.</p><p>Tonight`s talkathon, by the way, tensions flared between the two party leaders. No surprise there between Mitch and Chuck. Let`s take a look at the heated exchange on the Senate floor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: Just renew my request for one other leader said, no, I get it. One more. Will we have time, more than ten hours, since this is a complicated bill, to review the bill? Will it be available to us and the public more than ten hours before we have to vote for it?</p><p>MCCONNELL: I think --</p><p>SCHUMER: Since our leader has said, our Republican leader, that there`ll be plenty of time for a process, where people can make amendments. You need time to prepare those amendments.</p><p>MCCONNELL: I think we`ll have ample opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p>SCHUMER: Will it be more than ten hours?</p><p>MCCONNELL: I think we`ll have ample opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p>SCHUMER: I rest my case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s not much time to review a sixth of the American economy to get it right.</p><p>PETTYPIECE: It`s got about -- and to meet this timeline that McConnell set out, they have until the end of the week in order to get a CBO score to vote on it by July 4th. If you`re so proud of your bill and what it`s going to do, bring it out, let`s debate it, let`s discuss it, defend it --</p><p>MATTHEWS: You`re making the talking point. They`re not proud of it. They want to get the thing passed or defeated, but over with.</p><p>CORN: And let`s have hearings --</p><p>MATTHEWS: They want it over with now, because this is holding them up and it will hold them up through the summer. It`s a mistrial, so far, to use a recent reference.</p><p>CORN: Well, you also have to have hearings to explain the bill and have a policy discussion about it. John McCain last week was asked by a reporter, what does this bill do? What problems will it solve? What are some of the substances in it?</p><p>And he said, well, this is about getting the freedom caucuses and moderates together. No, those are two different issues. They still can`t --</p><p>MATTHEWS: By the way, have the Democrats ever rushed something through? Just laughing, because it`s been done before. I remember stimulus packages who have stuff in there from D.C. and some of these notes them.</p><p>Anyway, the roundtable is sticking with us. And up next, these three people will tell me something I don`t know. News coming up here.</p><p>You`re watching HARDBALL, where the action is.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, just a reminder, polls in that highly anticipated special election down in Georgia tomorrow night. That election closes at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. So, be sure to turn in tomorrow night to HARDBALL as the early returns start to come in. We might have something for you at 7:00 p.m. and we`ll be right back.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We`re back with HARDBALL roundtable.</p><p>And Yamiche is the first to tell us and me something I don`t know.</p><p>ALCINDOR: So, six members of the presidential advisory council on HIV AIDS resigned recently. They basically said that they do not believe that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is really focused on HIV policy and they`re not listening to them.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Did he pick them in the first place?</p><p>ALCINDOR: No, he did not pick them in the first place. This was something that was started in 1995 and it`s filled with like legal experts, doctors and stuff like that. So they`re not super partisan people, but they`re people that very frustrated with the health care.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, Reagan wasn`t too good on HIV either.</p><p>PETTYPIECE: Big tech meeting at the White House today. There was a lot of big name CEOs, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos. But it`s getting harder and harder for the White House to bring in the CEOs as he gets increasingly testy and tense between the administration and --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Was Schwarzman there?</p><p>PETTYPIECE: No, he was not at this one.</p><p>MATTHEW: Just trying to keep up with these guys.</p><p>Yes, David?</p><p>CORN: Georgia sixth, we`re talking about it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You want to make a prediction?</p><p>CORN: I`m not making a prediction.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Come on!</p><p>CORN: No, no, no, I have a relative down there who`s door knocking and she tells me that there`s still people who don`t know the election is tomorrow.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>CORN: They know there`s an election and there`s been $50 million in ads.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, you know the Germans -- OK, when the Germans left Paris in 1944 -- `45, there were people sunbathing along the sand. Not everybody`s into politics.</p><p>CORN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: What`s that about? Something to do with politics? Not everybody pays attention.</p><p>Thank you, Yamiche Alcindor, Shannon Pettypiece and David Corn.</p><p>When we return, let me finish tonight with Trump Watch. You`re watching HARDBALL.</p><p>It`s so true.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Trump Watch, Monday, June 19th, 2017.</p><p>Donald Trump`s lawyer has drowned in his own talking points. He came on television yesterday to say that his client is not under investigation by special counsel Bob Mueller. He said it a number of times.</p><p>He also said on the same Sunday interview program that his client is, in fact, being investigated by special counsel Bob Mueller. He did. He said both things, 100 percent contradictory on the same program.</p><p>You know, this is a moment, a moment in history, nutty history. Remember the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky coming on all five Sunday interview programs the same weekend. We call that the full Ginsberg. What are we going to call this Sunday that Jay Sekulow came on TV to say two opposite things on the same Sunday, in fact, the same program?</p><p>This is a joke. The president of the United States has lawyered up to defend himself against the charge of collusion with the Russians which he could have quite easily dealt with in a single serious press interview, or a single serious interview. He could have put all of his cards on the table, everything he knew, that <person><nameText>Jared Kushner, </nameText></person>Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort had said to the Russians at his direction.</p><p>He could have sat down and done that. He chose not to. He`s chosen instead to build a wall between the country and the truth. He`s guarded that truth as if it were the golden Fort Knox which suggests that with all of his disclaimers and everything his mouth pieces have thrown at us, there is indeed gold behind that wall.</p><p>And that`s HARDBALL for now. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>\"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\" starts right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Let`s play HARDBALL.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, I`m Chris Matthews in Washington. Today`s opening day of the Major League Baseball season, of course. And I`m struck actually with a historic question. Did Donald Trump or didn`t he play ball with Vladimir Putin beginning with the 2016 election? It`s a simple question. Was Trump responding again and again to Putin`s push to bring down Hillary Clinton? And was all that stuff he was throwing out there, the meeting to get dirt on her, the public calls to Moscow for her emails, the change in the republican platform to support Russia`s position Ukraine, the talk of easing sanctions, was it all Trump saying again and again to Putin, you keep up what you`re doing and I`ll make it worth your while?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We`re not going to get a lot of the answers until the full Mueller report is released. We learned actually that the report tell us more than 300 pages, pages that could go well beyond the principal conclusions that the Attorney General gave us in his four-page summary. Until then, we`re not going to know all the intrigue, all that Mueller`s investigators actually found out.</p><p>Now, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee believes finding the answers to those questions whether Trump played ball with Putin is not only a justified mission but a vital question for this country. Offering out one indisputable fact after another today, Congressman Adam Schiff castigated his republican colleagues for questioning his aggressive push for the truth about Trump`s backroom machinations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), C.A.: My colleagues may think it`s okay that the Russians offered dirt on a democratic candidate for president as part of what was described as the Russian government`s effort to help the Trump campaign. You might think it`s okay.</p><p>You might think it`s okay that their only disappointment after that meeting was that the dirt they received on Hillary Clinton wasn`t better.</p><p>You might think it`s okay that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness. You might think that`s okay, I don`t. I don`t think it`s okay. I think it`s immoral, I think it`s unethical, I think it`s unpatriotic and, yes, I think it`s corrupt and evidence of collusion. But I do not think that conduct, criminal or not, is okay.</p><p>And the day we do think that`s okay is the day we will look back and say that is the day America lost its way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: That may be Adam Schiff`s finest moment so far.</p><p>To the Congressman`s point, Max Frankel today wrote The New York Times op- ed that Trump`s unseemly relationship with Russia is hiding right there in plain sight. Quote, there was no need for a detailed electoral collusion between a Trump campaign Vladimir Putin`s oligarchy because they had an overarching deal, the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy. Frankel writes as Robert Mueller surely discovered in tracking down these dealings, the promise of policy changes was not in itself illegal.</p><p>I`m joined now by Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor, Tim O`Brien is Executive Editor of Bloomberg Opinion, and Phil Rucker is the White House Bureau Chief at The Washington Post.</p><p>I want to start with Phil. There to be -- I know we`ve all been overwhelmed by the Mueller report four-page summary from Barr that there was no crime that he can find by a reasonable doubt. But, my God, imagine if the history books are closed on this and it says, Trump had a lot of dealings back and forth with the Russian oligarchs and Putin, he was after a lot of dirt from them, that he was offering up a lot -- a much better U.S. policy, on sanctions, on everything else. He`s going to back them on their grab of Ukraine and all that, a grab for Ukraine, and all that now. But they couldn`t prove criminality and that was the end of the conversation.</p><p>It seems to me that politicians in the Democratic Party and some of the Republican Party are saying, wait a minute, do I agree with Adam Schiff who says, is this okay that a President dealing back [ph] and they were playing ball, these are the American phrase, you do this, I`ll do that. Your thoughts. Is this story over because you can`t prove an actual crime in the courts?</p><p>PHIL RUCKER, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, the story is not over, Chris, because what we have Mueller, according to the letter from Bill Barr, saying that he couldn`t give enough evidence to prove a conspiracy or to charge a crime here. But that doesn`t mean that no evidence exists. And, in fact, in that 300-page report, we can surmise there must be some details Mueller is going to share about what he and his investigators uncovered. And that`s why the democrats in Congress had been so adamant about seeing the report themselves and not relying only on the Attorney General`s four-page summary of the report.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, that`s a great question tonight. I think it`s more -- it`s a legal question, it`s also a political question, because the job of Mueller was to dig up the facts, find out what the Russians did, to interrupt in our elections, screwing then basically us and our democracy and also to find out if any Americans, particularly the President, were helpful to them or encouraging to them. It seems that that`s a pretty big question. And it`s answered in 300-plus pages. I wonder if that is a big risk that the democrats and the others in Congress should be looking at before they make any judgment about this president. Your thoughts.</p><p>JOYCE VANCE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: We have to see the report before we can make any reliable judgments. And there`s a nuance, Chris. We`re told that the report is some 300 pages. We don`t know how much of that Mueller`s analysis and how much of that is exhibit. So it could be that Mueller has written very little and that it contains a lot of exhibits. It could be that this is 300 pages of analysis and that there are exhibits beyond that. We`ll have to wait and see.</p><p>But Phil makes an important point, which is that there is this universe of criminality, of conspiracy. And our criminal justice system is only designed to make the decision about whether someone should be indicted and face prison for criminal conduct. It doesn`t give them a blessing if a decision made is not to indict them. In fact, for many people, they can be subjected to a civil lawsuit or some other kind of regulatory activity, even if what they`ve done isn`t criminal, same for a president except his congressional oversight.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I just wonder if anybody on earth think it was okay to have your kid, in this case, the President`s son and namesake, head over to the Trump Tower and looked for dirt on Hillary Clinton, if it was okay to go meet them in all these other places to get dirt and ask for emails and all this stuff and then to change republican platform, according to the Russians interest?</p><p>Anyway, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued this message today to the Attorney General Bill Barr, when asked if she is ready to accept his four- page summary of Mueller`s report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), C.A.: I have said and I`ll say it again. No, thank you, Mr. Attorney General. We do not need your interpretation. Show us the report and we can draw our own conclusions. We don`t need you interpreting for us. It was condescending, it was arrogant and it wasn`t the right thing to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Now, it appears increasingly unlikely that Barr will comply with congressional demands to see Robert Mueller`s full un-redacted report.</p><p>According to NBC News tonight, House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler spoke with Attorney General Barr last night and, quote, Barr all but refused to give Nadler an un-redacted copy. He wouldn`t even give it to the Chairman even. And Barr also refused to commit to asking a judge to release grand jury information to the Congress. So the next step could be a subpoena.</p><p>I want to go to Tim on this and the questions. Sometimes you miss the forest for the trees. And I think it`s focused on legal details, and they`re important, obviously. But it seems to me the question of impeachment and whether the President has abused his office, whether he was abusing the political process to get to that office, to win the presidency is the big one in broad daylight. And I`ve said this for a long time, and I think this is true about obstruction too. Firing Comey, intimidating Comey, asking for a break for Flynn, all those steps were pretty obvious what he was up to, getting rid of Sessions, humiliating Sessions because he recused himself. All these steps to get in the way of actually law enforcement and true justice were so obvious. I wonder if we`re looking for something we found months ago. Your thoughts, Tim.</p><p>TIM O`BRIEN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, BLOOMBERG OPINION: Well, I think some of the questions that greeted the President when he was campaigning and after he won the election, Chris, are still there. I primarily am interested in financial conflicts of interest that involve deals in Russia, the Middle East, China and around the United States. And those don`t go way because a law enforcement official has said certain actions that the President, his family and members of his administration engaged in didn`t rise to a criminal offense.</p><p>That still doesn`t obviate issues that touch on ethics, conflicts of interest and potentially the President creating policymaking favors in order to fatten his own wallet. Those existed when he came into office. They continue to exist today and they`re right for exploration. And, in fact, as we know well, there are other jurisdictions that are looking at those issues, including the Southern District of New York, the State Attorney General`s Office in New York, as well as State`s Attorney Generals elsewhere. So I think this is an issue that`s going to continue to be and should be probed. And then, obviously, Adam Schiff and other members of Congress sit atop five committees that are exploring these things.</p><p>So, no, I don`t think there`s any doubt that there are issues there that still needed to be probed. I think what we`re in the midst of right now is a profound battle to spin what Bill Barr`s letter meant and to give it a closed door effect that I don`t think, personally, as journalist, it should have right now. I think if the President says he`s been completely exonerated and as the White House says, he`s been completely exonerated, the easiest tool to use is to show that to the American public is to this report come out and let people see what`s in it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes. Let me go to Phil on that, the question of perception in this weekend, you know, how they do all these things. You know how the weekend cycle works, the fact that they dumped this on a Friday night so they could skip all the commerce [ph] who write on Thursday with their deadlines and all these old tricks they pulled. This coming weekend, beginning tomorrow, we got the first week to absorb this. Trump could win the first weekend simply because we haven`t seen the report.</p><p>RUCKER: And he`s absolutely won the first week. But like the other guest said, this is not over. And there`s a lot more information that the public is going to learn about this and Trump and his allies are in danger right now of sort of calling a game before it`s over and becoming embarrassed by negative information that --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Do you hear that from them? Are they worried that they`re setting themselves up for the full truth hurting them?</p><p>RUCKER: They don`t acknowledge there`s a worry. But I will say, if there is a 300-page report, there`s likely to be something that`s unflattering to the President, and then those 300 pages that could come out and embarrass him. And so this is a concern politically for them.</p><p>MATTHEWS: The revision has begun. The President is now saying that Russia didn`t want him to be the president, saying they would have been better off with Hillary Clinton. Watch him. This is nonsense.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: I hope we really get along well with them. But they would have been a lot better off with Hillary Clinton as president. Russia, if they were at all for me -- and by the way, if you look at all of those things, they were sort of for and against both, not just one way. But you look at all the different things. Russia would much rather have Hillary than Donald Trump. I can tell you that right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, that hot dogging in the end zone, which I think is illegal in the NFL right now, the complete hotdog, his pointer is nonsense. Trump`s claim contradicts U.S. intelligence that showed that Russia had a clear preference for Trump in the campaign. Putin also said himself last spring that he wanted Trump, Putin did, not Clinton. Let`s watch Vladimir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA PRESIDENT: Yes, I did. Yes, I did because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, that`s embarrassing. Let me go to Joyce on this question. There`s a couple of patterns here that our mob like. First of all, the President throughout the campaign saying that anybody who told the truth was a rat. I mean, he sounds like an old gangster movie from the `20s. I mean, a president would be interested, I would think, at least theoretically, in the truth being told. Here, if you tell the truth, you`re a rat, a dirty rat, like James Cagney. You`re a dirty rat. He talks like that.</p><p>And today, just before our program, Ari Melber had a guest that came on and said, looks like Roger Stone is going to get a pardon. So pardons and calling people rats, if that`s not public intimidation to interrupt the law, to abuse or an act to obstruct justice, I don`t know what it is. And it keeps going on and on, and especially this lying about Putin again. It is a lie.</p><p>VANCE: This is the man who`s in charge of the federal justice system, he`s in charge of federal law enforcement. And he takes the most animus stance towards law enforcement. He`s against flipping, what he calls flipping. He`s against what he calls rats. Those are legitimate law enforcement tools. That`s the way law enforcement gets to the truth and engages in accountability for people who have violated criminal laws. And here, we have the President who`s so familiar and so comfortable with the language of criminals and has so much difficulty with the language of the rule of law and the search for truth that law enforcement engages in every day under his direction.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, Vladimir Putin was closer to the truth that Trump is. He said said he was rooting for Trump and it was obvious they were playing ball together to anyone who`s paid attention.</p><p>Thank you so much, Joyce Vance, again and again. Thank you, Tim O`Brien, for your expertise on this guy we`re talking about, the President. And, Phil Rucker, a great reporter for The Washington Post.</p><p>Coming up, Elizabeth Warren plays HARDBALL. She`s coming here in a minute. That`s on tape. But recently, she was here. The Massachusetts Senator and 2020 presidential candidate joins me to talk about the Mueller report, Trump`s kill shot on Obamacare, which he`s refreshed with the courts the other day, and the prospect of facing her, facing Donald Trump. I asked her about what would it be like to stand up to the guy across the stage?</p><p>Plus, President Trump is in Michigan tonight getting ready for his favorite past time. It`s isn`t baseball. It`s a rally to fire up his base. Are we going to hear more treason charges against the democrats?</p><p>We`ve got a lot to get through tonight. Stick with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I really look forward to campaigning. It`s just a little bit early. Just like Elizabeth Warren. I hit her too hard, too early and now it looks like she`s finished. I wish she would have been in the race and, frankly, I would have loved to have run against her. But I would say she`s probably finished. But they have plenty left.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL. Elizabeth Warren seems to get under President Trump`s skin like no other candidate in the race. Senator Warren was the first major democrat to jump in to the 2020 contest to replace Donald Trump. She`s also pushed some of the boldest and most progressive policies of anyone in the field, including a wealth tax for the richest American families, Medicare for all, breaking up big tech companies, like Amazon and Facebook. She has just announced a plan to break up some of the country`s largest corporate agricultural business as well, writing corporate consolidations that`s choking family farms.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joins us right now. Thank you so much. I`ve got to get to some of the news and then we`ll get to agriculture. The first big news stories, 300 -page Mueller report. Should that be subpoenaed by the Congress?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), M.A.: Look, the report needs to be made public. Congress can subpoena and however we do it, the report needs to be made public. That`s all there is to say.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Okay. Apart from the legalities, which Mr. Mueller engaged in investigating, let`s talk about the whole picture of guide here over the last couple of years of Trump and the Russians. Do you believe, looking at all that you`ve seen in the last couple of years, was he playing ball with Putin?</p><p>WARREN: You know, it`s crazy for us to be talking about that though without the Mueller report in front of us. The whole point is here`s this 300-page report, a 22-month investigation, $25 million, put the report out there, put it with the rest of the information we have and then we`ll all have a better idea.</p><p>The idea that somehow we`re going to hide this thing, no. Just put the information out there. If, as the Attorney General says, the conclusions have been drawn, there`s nothing to hide, then what`s the problem letting the American people see it?</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, based upon all we have seen though in the public light, things like the meeting at the Trump Tower to get dirt on Hillary Clinton, the call by the President as a candidate to get dirt, to get the emails from Russia, all the meetings, all that, does that suggest to you there was a back and forth going on, but Putin wanted to help (sic) Hillary, Trump wanted to help him do that?</p><p>WARREN: Look, it looks like pieces in the puzzle.</p><p>But, like I said, you need the Mueller report. You need all of the pieces. Lay it out in front of us. Let the American people see it all. There should be nothing hidden here.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s talk about a big one. You`re going after the big corporations. You`re very much a Teddy Roosevelt trustbuster, if you will.</p><p>WARREN: Yes, my favorite president.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: By the way, a good Republican.</p><p>Well, that makes sense. You`re going after agriculture.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Tell me how big agribusiness hurts the small farmer, which is of lure in this country, the small farmer. We all love that small person out there, the family out on the plains. We love them. How`s this hurt them?</p><p>WARREN: So, understand, a generation ago, 37 cents out of every food dollar went into the farmer`s pocket. Today, it`s 15 cents out of every food dollar.</p><p>So what`s happened to the rest of it? It`s that a handful of giant corporations have figured out how to grow bigger, how to take more of the profits for themselves, how to cut out the competition, and how to put the squeeze on small and medium-sized farms.</p><p>They have done it through mergers, which I have opposed, like the Monsanto- Bayer merger, which now is going to reduce the number of places that farmers can buy seed from and the variety of seeds that are available. And you`re going to have less competition in setting the price for those seeds.</p><p>It also works in terms of vertical integration. So, right now, in the poultry industry, for example, Perdue and other big producers have figured out they will run every bit from fertilizing the eggs all the way to the end in getting the chickens slaughtered and packed up. They figured out which parts are profitable, and they take those for the giant corporations.</p><p>And they leave the farmers something called contract farming, where all of the risk is on the farmers, and the ability to make profits has been squeezed almost to nothing.</p><p>Family farms are important. Medium-sized farms are important. Competition in farming is important. But the only way we do that is if we have enforcement of the antitrust laws.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARREN: You know, for me, Chris, this is the same issue I keep talking about. Washington works great for giant corporations. Just not working for anybody else.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Maybe this is why Trump, the president, is afraid of you the most, because he gives you nicknames, he chases after you. He was doing it again last night, because you have drawn a line.</p><p>You are for the market.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But you want the market to be refined in the public interest. You`re not happy with the word socialist. Tell me about that distinction.</p><p>You had lunch today with a very major figure now in the Democratic Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. What would be the difference between you and the way that she very comfortably accepts the term socialist, Democratic socialist -- or socialist Democrat?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARREN: What we actually talked about today are the things where we think we need to make big change in this country.</p><p>This wasn`t, for us, about a conversation about political labels. It was a conversation about how we make this country work better, not just for a thin slice at the top, how we make it work for everyone. And that`s true when we`re talking about child care, when we`re talking about a wealth tax, when we`re talking about an America that right now is working great for the rich and the powerful.</p><p>It`s working great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. But this is our moment, our chance to be bold, our chance to say that we can truly, from the grassroots up, build a movement that makes markets, makes this country work better for everyone.</p><p>It`s not that hard. We pass a wealth tax -- just to pick that one -- 2 percent on the biggest fortunes in this country, and you know what we can do? We can do universal child care, universal pre-K, zero to 5, all our kids, and still have $2 trillion left over, money to reduce the student loan debt burden, money to put into housing, money that we can use as a down payment on a green deal.</p><p>That`s how we build a future, not just for those at the top, but build a future for everyone.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Are you looking forward to a debate like this with the president, with Donald Trump?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: This very debate?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You bet. Yes.</p><p>People across this country get it. They understand what`s not working for them. I see this. I have now done 40-plus town halls, fenced with people. I have taken nearly 200 open, public questions. I have done long selfie lines.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: People understand what`s not working in this country, and they are fired up and ready to make change.</p><p>And the way we do that is, we point out what`s wrong, exactly what`s broken. Let`s be specific about it, where big corporations are squeezing people. This is how we fix it. And this is how we`re building the grassroots movement to make that happen.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, at least he`s not calling you pencil neck. He seems to be afraid of you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Anyway, thank you. You know what I`m talking about. Thank you very much, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.</p><p>Up next: It looks like nobody was more surprised by Trump labeling the GOP as the party of health care than Republicans. And now they`re left scrambling to come up with a plan. They got nothing. They have nothing to live up to the president`s promise, empty-handed, guys.</p><p>We will be back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: What we do have a problem with, one, that the Democrats wrote a bill that`s unconstitutional.</p><p>Democrats promised us, if you like your health care, you could keep it. We found that to be true. We saw premiums have now risen, when they said they would go down.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, Obamacare has been an absolute disaster. If we win on Obamacare, it will be terminated in the courts. And we will see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>Close your eyes, and you would think we were back in 2010, nine years ago, when Republicans were actually winning on the health care issue. But, since then, the public`s backing of the Affordable Care Act has grown significantly, with now a majority now supporting Obamacare. It`s a fact.</p><p>Republicans in Congress have voted close to 70 times, however, to try to repeal it. And now Donald Trump wants to give it another -- well, he wants to get rid of it again. He`s going for the kill shot, this time in the courts.</p><p>Not all Republicans are pleased with this big development. One Republican senator told Politico: \"We need a plan. And right now, we don`t have one. I`m not going to just throw this out to the whims of our creativity.\"</p><p>Another person close to the president told Politico: \"Trump knows that he made a mistake, but he`s dug in now.\"</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence`s chief of staff, Marc Short, told Katy Tur of this network that a plan was in the works.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATY TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: What is the plan that the White House will have to replace it and not -- so that 20 million Americans are not suddenly without health insurance?</p><p>MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: You should you should rest assured that 20 million Americans will certainly not be without health insurance. There`s going to be plenty of time for us to come forward with -- with more detail. And I think you will see the health and human services secretary do that in the coming months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, that`s a promise President Trump has made again and again.</p><p>Let`s watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We`re going to take care of everybody. But we`re going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.</p><p>We will have health care. It`s going to happen. As soon as we get to taxes, we work on the health care. We`re going to happen. We`re coming closer, closer. I think now we have a plan that`s going to be great.</p><p>We are coming out with so many health care plans that are so much better than anything you have ever seen before.</p><p>And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we will have a plan that`s far better than Obamacare.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: For more, I`m joined by former Senator Claire McCaskill, Missouri -- Democrat from Missouri, and former U.S. Congressman Carlos Curbelo, Republican from Florida.</p><p>So, a couple questions, but the big one up front, Senator, is how do you have protections for people with preexisting conditions, diabetes, et cetera, and they can health care at a reasonable price, when you don`t have a plan?</p><p>CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: Well, you said it, Chris. They have got nothing.</p><p>I think the biggest fraud and hoax of the last decade in American politics was the notion that the Republican Party had a way to bring down health care costs and also keep insurance companies off the back of the American people by protecting preexisting conditions.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>MCCASKILL: They have said repeal and replace for a decade. They have never had a replace plan that did any of the things they have promised.</p><p>And I will tell you what`s really interesting to watch. President Trump has now dumped this on Mitch McConnell`s lap. And it`s like that game hot potato. Everybody`s trying to throw the potato around. And they`re trying to throw it back to the White House.</p><p>So I think it`s important for the Democrats in Congress to say every day, where is the president`s health care plan? Because you know what? They do not have one that will work for the American people.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Congressman, what does the Republican Party do if the courts do, if the Supreme Court does -- it`s a Republican Supreme Court basically -- if now, without the tax in it, without the sanction if you don`t pay into it, what happens if they do strike it down as unconstitutional?</p><p>Isn`t your party, the Republican Party, stuck empty-handed, with nothing for the people, 20 million people?</p><p>CARLOS CURBELO (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: In that case, the only path forward, Chris, would be a bipartisan compromise on health care.</p><p>And in the 115th Congress, there were Republicans and Democrats in the Senate trying to craft an agreement. But that`s the only potential plan. I can assure you that congressional Republicans are not excited by this last statement by the president on health care.</p><p>I remind you that the president, just a couple years ago, had a big celebration at the White House, when the House did pass a repeal and replace measure, only to call it a mean bill a couple weeks later.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right.</p><p>CURBELO: So I don`t think there`s a lot of trust between congressional Republicans and the White House.</p><p>And I can assure you that no one is excited about this latest escapade.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You know, Senator, back in the `30s, I heard a tape of it, of FDR, the great Democratic president.</p><p>He once said, the Republicans always say, we`re going to do everything that Democrats do, and it`s not going to cost you a nickel. It was great.</p><p>And now they are saying, we`re going to give you health care, preexisting condition, coverage for your kids up to age the 26, without a nickel, without even a program.</p><p>It`s \"The Music Man.\" It`s nothing.</p><p>MCCASKILL: Yes.</p><p>The sad thing about this is, almost from day one, when you do a big change in the health care system, like we did with the ACA, there were things that needed to be fixed and tweaked.</p><p>But Mitch McConnell knew he had a political two-by-four. And he -- as usual, all he cares about is getting Republicans elected, not the underlying policy. So he didn`t want to work with us to fix some of the things that can be and still could be fixed in the ACA, because they were so determined to make Obamacare the bad guy.</p><p>Well, and here`s the other thing that really irritates me about what`s being said today. They said, well, there`s no hurry here. That shows you how out of touch they are.</p><p>There are millions of Americans that will go to bed tonight worried because of what`s being said in Washington about health care, people that are worried that there will be caps on their policies, again, people that are worried that their children who are getting ready to go off their policies aren`t going to find a place they can get the affordable insurance that they can get now under the ACA, worried that they aren`t going to be able to get covered because they have been sick before.</p><p>If they are going to, in fact, put something else in place, they owe it to the American people to do it tomorrow, not to play around with this politically, and pretend that they have got a plan, when they`re not willing to show it to the people.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You know, Carlos, it seems to me we have watched politics for years. And one thing has been pretty static is that women voters tend to care about health care more than men. They`re more astute about it generally, because they generally in the household worry more about it. Just a fact there.</p><p>They`re the caretakers. They`re the stewards of health care in the family. They watch the -- what insurance covers and what it doesn`t cover. Men are sort of somewhat oblivious sometimes to what`s going on. This is a fact.</p><p>And you keep losing elections, Republicans, because the women swamp you in the numbers. Doesn`t the Republican Caucus, led by smart people like McCarthy and sometimes Mitch, understand you`re giving up the majority voter, which is the woman, on this issue? It`s a killer issue, health care.</p><p>CURBELO: Well, just look at the 2018 elections, Chris. Democrats used health care. It was the most prominent issue in all their ads, and that delivered them a 40-seat win in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>And it was a lot of suburban women that did abandon Republicans. Now, the Republican Party has delivered on health care in the past. I remind everyone that it`s thanks to congressional Republicans and the Bush administration that seniors in this country have a prescription drug benefit.</p><p>The difference between then and now is that the Bush administration and the congressional leaders of the time had a plan. They tried to approach Democrats. They worked with some Democrats. There is no plan today. There wasn`t a plan in the 115th Congress, the last Congress, when Republicans started the effort to repeal and replace the ACA.</p><p>So that`s the big difference. There`s no plan. So, for now, this is just a gift to congressional Democrats, because Republicans were already clobbered in the 2018 election because of the health care issue.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well said.</p><p>Anyone, on his way to Michigan tonight, President Trump announced he would reverse his administration`s proposal to the kill money for the Special Olympics. Let`s watch this switcheroo.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Special Olympics will be funded. I heard about it this morning. I have overridden my people. We`re funding the Special Olympics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Claire McCaskill, I think the president heard the public`s reaction to killing the program that benefits so many especially young Americans who have challenges.</p><p>MCCASKILL: Yes, if he just heard about it this morning, that`s a head- scratcher, right, because this has been out there for certainly a couple of days now.</p><p>And I really think the other thing that`s interesting about this is, he doesn`t -- he`s not reversing anything. They have submitted a budget to Congress. And Congress is going to ignore the cuts to Special Olympics. They were never -- I mean, my former colleague Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri who`s the head of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate that will determine this, said yesterday there`s no way he was going to cut funding for Special Olympics.</p><p>So this is a congressional decision. The president doesn`t have the power to do this. But, once again, he wants to make it look like that it`s all about him, even when it`s about a whole lot of young people who have a special opportunity through the Special Olympics that should be supported by every level of government.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well said.</p><p>Thank you so much, Senator, former Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri and former Congressman Carlos Curbelo of Florida.</p><p>Up next: President Trump has vindication on his mind as he hits the road tonight, revenge. His victory lap is being interrupted by his revenge thinking.</p><p>And there`s new reporting out tonight on the White House strategy of weaponizing the Mueller report on the campaign trail. I guess he likes Robert Mueller now for a couple days.</p><p>That`s coming up next.</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>Tonight, President Ford -- President Trump -- actually Gerry Ford came from Grand Rapids. President Trump is out there tonight taking a victory lap on the Mueller report, or at least Attorney General William Barr`s four-page summary of it.</p><p>Well, the president again accused the FBI and Democrats of treason. Well, he did it last night. Let`s watch him tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just in case Hillary Clinton lost, they wanted an insurance policy against me and what we were playing out until recently was the insurance policy. They wanted to do a subversion. It was treason. It was really treason.</p><p>If the Republican Party had done this to the Democrats, if we had done this to President Obama, you`d have 100 people in jail right now and it would be treason. It would be considered treason and they`d be in jail for the rest of their lives.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s his word, treason. By the way, that was last night. \"The Atlantic\" reports that Trump`s allies want to make Mueller`s findings a core piece of coming up in 2020 and the campaign messaging. Quote: Trump allies see Barr`s letter, the four-page letter, as a kind of Swiss army knife, a tool useful in all kinds of situations. Not only is it exculpatory, they say, but also implicitly rebukes the press for its coverage of the Russia investigation, inoculating Trump from any future scandals that reporters might unearth.</p><p>As I said, President Trump is speaking to supporters in Michigan now and his exoneration message is on full display as he goes after the deep state, he calls it, and his political opponent. That`s all coming up next here.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.</p><p>President Trump is speaking right now in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And from the start, he had one message, revenge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans -- many of them, they suffered -- with an elaborate hoax. Today, our movement and our can country are thriving. Their fraud has been exposed and the credibility of those who push this hoax is forever broken. And they`ve now got big problems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I`m joined now by Jason Johnson, politics editor for theroot.com, and John Brabender, Republican strategist.</p><p>John, I`ll start with you. I`ve never heard these words in modern American politics -- treason, traitor, hoax. The language is a language of a third world country where your opponent goes to jail, the winner puts him to jail, and the loser says it was rigged.</p><p>It`s third world talk. This is Venezuela talk. I`m sorry.</p><p>JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Look, I`m going to defend the president.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Go ahead, go for it.</p><p>BRABENDER: In fairness, the words he said about himself, agent of Russia, I mean, all these things the last couple of years. He is acting like a man who was wrongly accused and wants to get --</p><p>MATTHEWS: You think he wasn`t playing ball with Putin all those months? Come on.</p><p>BRABENDER: I`m going to give you a good example. Everybody said the Russians had their polling data. That meant nothing because --</p><p>MATTHEWS: They gave it to the Russians.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: For what reason? The Russians could have done their own poll.</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, THEROOT.COM: They`re having the meetings, they`re lying about the meetings. He`s saying, Russian, please come and take --</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s saying Putin was for Hillary.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, every single thing that president was saying showed he had some sort of -- if it didn`t work as collusion it`s only because his phone wasn`t working that day.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, explain to me the politics of this.</p><p>Going after the guys with the hats on. I got family members, I know all about this, the people with the hats, the MAGA hats. It`s all there.</p><p>But what about vengeance? Is this going to insight them to vote in 2020?</p><p>BRABENDER: I don`t think it`s vengeance. I think what he`s doing is he`s putting a stake in the heart of the issue the Democrats wanted to run on in 2020.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Like they`re vampires?</p><p>BRABENDER: No. What the Republicans want to run on are two things. Look at the economy and look at, we`re getting sand kick in our face anymore, and look how they want to make us into --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Here he goes after the guy called pencil neck. He`s still good the nicknames. He went after intelligence chair Adam Schiff of California, here he goes personal again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Little pencil neck Adam Schiff. I saw him today. Well, we don`t really know. There could still have been some Russia collusion.</p><p>Sick. Sick. These are sick people. And there has to be accountability because it`s all lies and they know it`s all lies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: It`s tonight, Jason. He went after not just calling pens, that was a term he used for intellectuals, I know all of that. But he makes it physical. He says he has the thinnest neck. I mean, this is eighth grade, this is school yard stuff.</p><p>JOHNSON: This is what the president always does. What amazes is, you know, look, he`s such a paper tiger. I mean, you know, when Joe Biden says I`ll take you behind the bleachers and punch you, he might do it.</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s not be good for the country, two 78-year-old guys pounding each other.</p><p>JOHNSON: The race would be fascinating. But the truth of the matter is that sort of bravado, that sort of violence, that sort of gins up his audience.</p><p>But I`ve got to say, because this is absolutely incorrect. There is not one Democrat running on impeachment. The Democrats won 2018 --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: The only reason they even want the report is to see if they can cherrypick anything out of --</p><p>JOHNSON: That`s going to happen regardless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: The talking how the president does, where is he today? Michigan. He`s got to win Michigan or Pennsylvania. These are --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Republican is very strong in Michigan. In fact, winning there. He`s not winning in Pennsylvania, you know well. But what`s his strategy in Michigan? Why did he go there tonight? Trade?</p><p>BRABENDER: Well, I think a lot of it had to do with trade. Certainly, but he`s got to be in Michigan, they`re going to contest in Pennsylvania as well, and the reason is why this Mueller thing mattered is he can still see what they tried to do in Washington to us reformers.</p><p>JOHNSON: It`s not going to change anyone`s mind. The Democrats are going to run on economy, corruption and health care, are all things he continues to give to them on a regular basis.</p><p>BRABENDER: What it looks like now is that the Washington elitists went after a president who tried to change thins.-</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: We`re losing in the time fight here.</p><p>BRABENDER: I`m just telling you, the president now has his message because he can say, look, what they tried to do to me because I did everything for you. And, oh, by the way, they`ve all become --</p><p>MATTHEWS: How high can get? Can he get about 46?</p><p>BRABENDER: The polls don`t matter --</p><p>MATTHEWS: I mean, we`re talking about election eve, how can he get in this country? Can he past 45 percent this president?</p><p>BRABENDER: It doesn`t matter.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s going to pencil neck his opponents. That`s his strategy. He`s only going to run a negative campaign.</p><p>BRABENDER: These things don`t matter anymore.</p><p>JOHNSON: All of these states, that blue wall went back blue in 2018. He`s going to have to do more than just show up in Michigan. He`s going to have to have a strong economy and a message other than school yard names.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRABENDER: He does have a lot of things. He does have a strong economy and if you nominated one of your social Democrats, who are never going to play in Michigan --</p><p>JOHNSON: Democrats are going to be running on other social issues.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I know he`s got the issues, I`m not going to tell him but I know what they are. He can win Pennsylvania, he can. He can go after the socialist tag, whatever it is for suburbs, because it`s not about ideology to a suburbanite. A suburbanite maybe, husband and wife both make 150. They`re coming after us. They`re not going after the billionaires and the millionaires. That`s how people hear the word \"socialism.\"</p><p>Anyway, thank you, Jason Johnson. Thank you, John Brabender.</p><p>Up next, Devin Nunes rides again. You got to wait to this thing. This guy`s unashamed. Trump`s top congressional ally acolyte really wants to investigate the investigators, or as he sees them, the president`s enemies. You got to catch it. This guy is no Paul Revere.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>MATTHEWS: We`re weeks away from getting a look inside that 300-page Mueller report and Trump allies already out there trying to undercut it.</p><p>In service to the president, Devin Nunes wants to attack the FBI for how it originated the probe into Trump`s Russian dealings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: My major concern now is, is that the FBI and DOJ falsely claimed this investigation didn`t begin until late July. We now know for certain that`s not true. We are prepared and are now drafting a criminal referral. We think it will grab everybody that we need to grab to make sure there`s a proper investigation done, or at least our referral over to DOJ.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You remember Nunes, of course. He`s a Republican congressman from California`s Central Valley. According to the president, he`s the great American hero.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They tried to destroy that man because he spoke up for good and just and all of the things that you have to speak up for. But most people don`t have the courage to do it. He will be some day hailed as a great American hero for what he did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well., everyone else remembers Nunes for his notorious midnight ride of two years ago when he raced down to the White House one night and returned to the same White House the next morning with what he called hot stuff against the FBI that he later claimed he picked up from what he called secret sources.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: What I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russia investigation, has everything to do with possible surveillance activities and the president needs to know these intelligence reports are out there and I have a duty to tell him that.</p><p>REPORTER: Did this come from the White House? Did this information --</p><p>NUNES: As you know, we have to keep our sources and methods very, very quiet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: But once exposed, the congressman is down and back ride to the Trump White House made him seem like the president`s gopher.</p><p>Here was an elected official, a member of another branch of government acting like a courier for the man in the White House. This wasn`t Paul Revere signaling one if by land, two if by sea. It was Devin Nunes saying, I work for Trump, and now he`s out riding again.</p><p>The California congressman wants a new investigation into whether the investigators did anything wrong in looking into the Trump operation. Here again, instead of doing his job of overseeing the executive branch, this congressman is out attacking the investigators themselves. All with the purpose of giving this president the total exoneration he covets.</p><p>That`s HARDBALL for now.</p><p>\"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\" starts right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Although the backdrop of<br/> improving and increasingly synchronized economic growth and good<br/> corporate earnings remained in place, investors had to come to terms<br/> with some ugly prospects: higher interest rates, a trade war between the<br/>U.S. and China, and increased regulation of technology companies.<br/> 1 Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.<br/> 2 Since the inception of the Portfolio\u2019s Advisor Class shares on December 1, 1996.<br/> 3 Since the inception of the Portfolio\u2019s Institutional Class shares on November 3, 2009.<br/> 4 Since the inception of the Portfolio\u2019s Institutional Class Z shares on August 1, 2017.<br/> 5 Shown net of Harding Loevner\u2019s contractual agreement through February 28, 2019.<br/> The markets\u2019 strong gains at the start of the year evaporated as<br/> sanguinity gave way to worry. Strong employment reports worldwide<br/> sowed fears of quickening monetary tightening by central banks seeking<br/> to avert a resurgence of general inflation. The bond market declined in<br/> accord with the higher rate outlook and the latter\u2019s deleterious effect on<br/> credit spreads, prompting equity investors, long accustomed to a<br/> disinflationary environment, to recalibrate the discount rates they use for<br/> valuation. Stock price volatility spiked at the end of January, exacerbated<br/> by the collapse of derivatives-based \u201cinverse volatility\u201d exchange-traded<br/> funds (ETFs), contributing to a near 9% decline in equities in just 10 days.<br/> After a brief bounce in mid-February, stocks resumed their decline in<br/> March, reflecting a new set of worries about increasingly ubiquitous<br/> technology platforms. A mounting furor over Facebook data illicitly<br/> exploited by political consultant Cambridge Analytica in favor of U.S.<br/> President Donald Trump and Brexit, and the mowing down of a pedestrian<br/> by an Uber self-driving car drew calls for more regulation of technology<br/> companies. The European Union continued its efforts to rein in \u201cbig tech,\u201d<br/> announcing a tax on turnover of large digital companies and moving<br/> ahead with its General Data Protection Regulation mandate, which<br/> imposes strict requirements and stiff penalties regarding treatment of<br/> private data. The tech tumult turned farcical with Trump tweeting<br/> potshots at Amazon.com  over its use of the Postal Service.<br/> All sectors registered declines, with the exception of information<br/> technology (IT) and consumer discretionary (specifically e-commerce),<br/> whose outsized January gains were nearly but not quite depleted by sharp<br/> declines late in the quarter as large internet companies came under<br/> increased scrutiny. Energy and materials stocks fell despite rising inflation<br/> expectations. Growing U.S. shale production led to doubts that the recent<br/> increase in oil prices would be sustained. Materials suffered from concern<br/> that rising protectionism threatens trade in commodities.<br/> Emerging Markets (EMs), more typically the loser from rising global risk<br/> and volatility, was the strongest-performing region. Confoundingly, its rise<br/> was supported by Brazil and Russia, two of the biggest exporters of steel<br/> and other commodities whose trade is endangered. A Brazilian court<br/> upheld the conviction of former president Luiz In225;cio Lula da Silva on<br/> corruption charges, likely precluding him from running again and<br/> restoring his redistributionist policies. Japan was the only other region to<br/> eke out a positive return in U.S. Dollars, as a stronger yen more than<br/> offset its decline in local currency. U.S. stock prices fell overall despite<br/> gains in IT and consumer discretionary. U.S. asset returns looked even<br/> worse to non-Dollar based investors, as the Dollar fell broadly against<br/> most major currencies.  <br/><br/>Complete document can be viewed at this link:     <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amgfunds.com\">https://www.amgfunds.com</url> /content/dam/amgfunds/documents/commentary/fc_harloev_gloeqfd_fc092.pdf  <br/><br/> Disclaimer: This anews/commentary/analysis etc. is for informational purposes only and nothing here  should be constructed as a solicitation, recommendation or an offer to buy or sell any share.

The positive relative performance derived primarily from good stock selection, although our overweight in IT, the strongest-performing sector, again worked in our favor. Within IT, 3D-design software developer Dassault Syst232;mes and Chinese social media platform Weibo led returns. Health care was led by medical information provider M3, which rose on news that the company acquired an American clinical trials firm, signaling entry into the large and profitable U.S. market. On the other side of the ledger, crop chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant Bayer suffered on news that regulators may require the company to divest some key businesses in order to win approval for its purchase of Monsanto, reducing its ability to exploit merger synergies. In financials, Brazilian lender Ita250; Unibanco rallied on the Lula court ruling, while DBS Group of Singapore signaled larger distributions of capital to shareholders with a surprising regular dividend increase plus a special dividend. Our holdings in Japan added the most to relative performance from a regional perspective, aided by M3 and Sysmex, the clinical-testing equipment manufacturer. Sysmex\u2019s management stoked optimism over the potential impact of its research &amp; development (R&amp;D) in liquid biopsy technology. Relative performance in EMs suffered as South African media conglomerate Naspers declined. Despite the large cash proceeds from the sale of a sliver of its successful investment in Chinese internet platform Tencent, many of Naspers\u2019 newer investments are still absorbing resources rather than generating cash flow. Samsung Electronics also underperformed due to concerns that it will earn lackluster returns from its large investment to supply the latest Apple iPhone, which has been met with slow demand. Sidebar: Portfolio Risk Analysis and the Market Correction7 By Scott Crawshaw The revival in market volatility this quarter provided a stark contrast to the recent period characterized by dampened volatility and investors\u2019 willingness to ignore the risks inherent in equities. By the end of 2017, the volatility in global equity index returns had fallen to that of fixed income barometers! We have written about the risks that we perceive in equity markets during this prolonged, ascending market, including our concerns about rising valuations of long-duration growth stocks, which are precisely the kind our investment philosophy propels us to own. We are cognizant that in recent quarters, our International Equity strategy model portfolio (upon which the International Equity Portfolio is managed) has exhibited higher volatility than that of the MSCI ACWI ex USA, though still low in an absolute sense, something contrary to its long-term 7 The calculations in this section are based on holdings-based returns. historical tendency. The quantitative risk model we use to analyze portfolio risks has pointed to portfolio holdings in IT and in EMs as key contributors to its rising forecasts of above-index volatility and a \u201cbeta\u201d greater than 1.00. More broadly, it has increasingly predicted that the fastest-growing companies, coincidentally where valuations have risen the most, would have the highest associated risk. Though we are aware of the model\u2019s elevated forecasts of portfolio risk, we have not chosen not to make material portfolio changes to manage this projected risk. Moreover, we wondered if the risk model was seeing the whole picture. We suspected that the Portfolio would prove, when volatility returned, to be more defensive than the model was predicting. The acute correction in early February and resurgent volatility provided, in effect, a test of the model\u2019s predictions. During the market correction from January 26 to February 9, the Portfolio fell nearly one-for-one with the index, a more positive result than predicted by the model, thanks to idiosyncratic effects from some individual holdings that reacted to good, stock-specific news\u2014something no model will ever forecast. Looking at the entire quarter, we note that although the Portfolio outperformed in January, some outperformance came in both of the down months, February and March, too. Although we have no insight into the near-term direction of markets (nor indeed of our stocks), experience has taught us that sticking to our philosophy of owning only (apparent) quality and growth increases the probability of avoiding terrible outcomes in the poorest markets. The Portfolio outperformed the benchmark over the long-term in part through the tendency to achieve better-than-expected results during challenging environments, when market returns are negative or only slightly positive. Perspective and Outlook \u201cIf you buy something because it\u2019s undervalued, then you have to think about selling it when it approaches your calculation of its intrinsic value. That\u2019s hard. But, if you can buy a few great companies, then you can sit on your ass. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d \u2014Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, 2000 Arguably the greatest contribution that Charlie Munger has made to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shareholders was in convincing Warren Buffett in the 1970s that a long-duration growth business trading at an apparently premium price could still represent a good value. His reasoning was that the return on the shares would ultimately converge with the return on capital for the business as the compounding of the latter would, over a long period of time (Munger cited 40 years), come to dwarf the initial premium paid for the shares. That inevitability meant that you could buy, then sit and wait\u2014but, presumably (and critically), only if you were assured that the company would manage to maintain its growth rate and sustain its high profitability in the process. You could tolerate occasional periods of overvaluation of that business\u2019s shares because, given enough time, its profits would grow back into its share price. As investors in businesses that can grow for many years with high and Q1 | 2018 Harding Loevner International Equity Portfolio COMMENTARY ASSET CLASS | INTERNATIONAL EQUITY Investor | HLMNX Institutional | HLMIX Institutional Class Z | HLIZX Visit our website at amgfunds.com  for more information 3 durable profitability, we at Harding Loevner adhere to an investment philosophy that resembles Munger\u2019s. Through our research process we look for companies that meet our criteria of what makes a great business. The process is focused entirely on business fundamentals: we evaluate the competitive structure of an industry, examine each participant\u2019s competitive position, and then question whether a favorable industry structure or the particular advantages enjoyed by some participants are sustainable into the future. Upon identifying such apparently great businesses, we include them in our qualified investable universe. We estimate what their shares are worth by making financial forecasts and discounting their projected long-term cash flows to the present. While we\u2019re not afraid to pay over the market average for shares of an excellent business, even a paragon will fail to make its way into the Portfolio if its superior long-term prospects are more than fully discounted in its current share price. Munger\u2019s challenge, and ours too, is in finding companies that will remain \u201cgreat\u201d for 10 years, let alone 40. Enduring jewels are more easily discovered in hindsight than in advance. The identification of such companies requires that all evidence in support of a purchase be weighed against an obvious fact\u2014that the vast majority of businesses fail to maintain their profitability over the long term. Once an investment is made, we do much more than sit and watch the returns pour in. We set up structures to seek out evidence that the company will not stay great forever. To be able to \u201csit\u201d comfortably on a holding presupposes, among other things, that the customers of that business continue to prefer its products or services. We guard against the risk of mishap through intensive monitoring of the business results of our Portfolio companies, parsing financial disclosures, and checking third-party sources to gauge their progress against the mileposts that we set out in advance as supporting detail to our investment thesis. There is nothing sedentary about our ownership. To \u201cbe right and sit tight,\u201d to borrow a phrase from legendary Wall Street trader Jesse Livermore, is easier said than done in other ways. In addition to guarding against the deterioration of companies\u2019 underlying businesses (the \u201cbe right\u201d part), investors need to guard against the human tendency to become risk averse when they are in a position of gain on their shares (the \u201csit tight\u201d part); investors tend to harvest their gains too early. They process the constant bombardment of ever-shifting news as calls to action, feeding the instinct to lock in profits and avoid reversals. That flow of news can be company-specific but is often related to the general environment in which companies operate. We resist changing our views in reaction to current events. We didn\u2019t alter the Portfolio materially in response to the Brexit referendum in 2016, nor to anticipate the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d nor, more recently, to benefit from the U.S. tax cuts; we also haven\u2019t moved to a stance that bets significantly on rising interest rates. Instead, we focus on the growth prospects for each company and the specific threats that could endanger its stock\u2019s market valuation relative to the rest of the market. These habits of tolerating elevated valuations and resisting wholesale topdown portfolio shifts have continued to benefit the Portfolio. Despite the rising interest rate headwind and consequential impact on discount rates, growth stocks (particularly the most expensive growth stocks) outperformed this quarter, extending the trend from last year. Although we recognize the share prices of most rapidly growing companies are high relative to earnings and their history, we continue to take action in favor of cheaper ones only incrementally, and only against the priciest stocks in the Portfolio. Our reluctance to position the Portfolio in anticipation of political or economic developments does not mean we ignore the gathering clouds. Central banks are withdrawing monetary stimulus in reaction to signs that inflation expectations are increasing, and in the larger cause of normalizing interest rates ahead of the next recession. Rising populism, particularly in Europe, has called into question the longstanding consensus on advantages of a common currency, tax-free trade, and free movement of labor. And now the U.S. threatens to precipitate a trade war that would have a devastating impact on globalization and potentially erase the enormous benefits that free trade has brought to nearly all parts of the world that have participated in it. The recent announcements by the Trump administration to enact tariffs on various imports\u2014including washing machines, solar panels, aluminum, steel, and, more recently, US$50 billion of other Chinese goods\u2014could have devastating consequences for the U.S. and its trading partners. While the brandishing of tariffs as a bilateral negotiating tactic\u2014 or as a domestic political sop\u2014is not unique to the Trump presidency (recall tariffs from Barack Obama on Chinese tires or George W. Bush on steel), Trump\u2019s enthusiastic use of them seems to us unusually provocative. The absolute amount of goods subject to tariffs is small relative to gross domestic product (GDP), but the legal justification for many of them relies on an obscure clause of trade law allowing redress on the grounds of national security. This rationale sets a dangerous precedent, as it is intended to evade any adverse ruling by objective outside bodies, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), and undermines the entire rules-based trading system that has served the global economy so well since the Second World War. While Trump insists that \u201ctrade wars are good,\u201d all evidence is to the contrary. Trade wars generally create losers on all sides. As countries, one after another, retaliate with their own tariffs or restrictions, the positive effects of globalization are undone. By preventing countries from focusing their productive efforts where each has a comparative advantage, trade barriers protect inefficient industries, resulting in misallocations of capital, higher costs and inflation, and lower wealth overall. Reversing globalization also has the potential to increase interest rates, which had been until recently on a more or less steady decline since the early 1980s. When economies are interdependent, local shocks are dampened by the global economy\u2019s equilibrating mechanism, reducing economic volatility and the real component of long-term interest rates. We are uneasy, but admit a range of possible outcomes, from spiraling titQ1 | 2018 Harding Loevner International Equity Portfolio COMMENTARY ASSET CLASS | INTERNATIONAL EQUITY Investor | HLMNX Institutional | HLMIX Institutional Class Z | HLIZX Visit our website at amgfunds.com  for more information 4 for-tat tariff actions to possibly more-measured responses, and perhaps even some positive long-term consequences, such as potential reform of the WTO. But we know from experience that we have little ability to forecast the political outcome. We have resisted the temptation to alter course, unsure even what overall course we would take if our worst fears were realized with respect to the health of the world\u2019s trading regime. Instead we continue to focus on the business fundamentals and valuations of the most resilient companies. Portfolio Highlights The two biggest contributors to positive relative returns in the Portfolio this quarter\u2014Dassault Syst232;mes and M3\u2014are prime examples of companies that Charlie Munger might like. In both cases, we\u2019ve been right about the durable profitability and rapid growth of the businesses. And Jesse Livermore would approve our having sat tight, as we have owned their shares continuously for a long time. We believed that both companies were capable of growing rapidly for many years. But to remain invested in them, we have had to live through periods of overvaluation. Japan\u2019s M3 is a health care IT company, first qualified and rated by one of our analysts in January 2006. M3\u2019s flagship service is MR-kun, an online platform for physicians that provides information specific to their individual therapeutic specialties, including all relevant research studies and clinical trial data. M3 now has recurring interaction with more than 80% of physicians in Japan, who represent a high-value audience for pharmaceutical companies seeking to develop or market new drugs. M3 will continue to grow as it adds more online and offline services in Japan. Meanwhile the company is replicating its information ecosystem outside of its home market, with four million doctors using its platform, and where it now garners 25% of its revenues. M3 is among Japan\u2019s fastest-growing companies, and, accordingly, its shares trade at apparent high prices. Today, M3\u2019s market capitalization is US$13 billion, compared with just over US$1 billion when we bought it in 2008. Dassault Syst232;mes, discussed in last quarter\u2019s report, is a 3D-design software company that we have owned since 2003. After starting with an aerospace-design focus, Dassault\u2019s software is now used by over 200,000 enterprises across a dozen industries in 140 countries. Its segment of the software industry, often referred to as product lifecycle management, features above-average and durable growth, fueled by the increasing global emphasis on efficient production. To Munger\u2019s point about the convergence of the return on capital of a business and the return to its shareholders, we have experienced something comparable. Over our 10-year holding period, M3 has had an average annual return on capital of 26%, within shouting distance of the 32% compound annual return of the shares in that time. Similarly, Dassault\u2019s return on capital has averaged 14% over our 15-year holding period, close to the 16% compound annual return of its shares. The Portfolio\u2019s structure has changed little in the quarter, with IT and health care remaining our largest overweights relative to the Index. We added one holding to the Portfolio. Novozymes is the leading manufacturer of industrial enzymes, used in a variety of applications, including fuel, detergent, and food. Its global market share approaches 50%, and the market is expanding as manufacturers replace inorganic chemicals in household products with naturally occurring enzymes. Novozymes controls more than twice as many patents as its next-largest competitor and spends more on R&amp;D than its three biggest rivals combined.

Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. </p><p>Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition.

Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. </p><p>Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-71dbf05c97044c26b1a755ebdb9e7cb9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3X-9651-DY08-303N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

ruthlessly exploited technology to dominate the market place and looking back I think that was actually a mistake the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft we made more than their share of mistakes and I think it's an interesting story because we had to learn hard we had learned was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but the way other people stars how we had to learn to connect with the world needed to assume more responsibility we needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us in here in that story I do think there are parallels for the tech sector is Hall today because it was tempting of course this was personified as A bit more than anybody else tempting to see this sort of the key extraordinarily smart business leader and a new enterprise tech oriented who really was it was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge of course bill gates wasn't really like that at all just as Mark Zuckerberg more recently isn't really like that at all is not just who are the key is a ruthless business man out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market I think without the worst statement that Bruyne where I would suggest he is in the world of technology people start companies with a great idea and then moving very fast and I think one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast one should never move faster than the speed of fire and they think if you look at the history of digital technology it has had a tenancy at times for companies to move past the old slogan was move fast and break things I think the new a straight red for a second that point you think Microsoft was was guilty of that in its determination to absolutely dominate ruled the operating system market for pieces I think that what we learned was that we need to think more broadly in their areas the singularity of folk acts that you often find in a very successful tech companies Microsoft would be among them and then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact the sure having on others other people in your industry the world is a war is so much greater the draft a step back he and internalise that that's the key to accept more responsibility interesting so if that's the place that big Tech's that today do you understand the cause of the being made across the political spectrum in the United States right now The couple of the biggest companies and if we get a name them then they would be Amazon on app for alphabet of course have Google then be Microsoft and Facebook there are I will quote you Senator Elizabeth Warren who formed presidential candidate of the Democratic party calling for the break up of those big companies because she says they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy I do believe we need to our say strengthen the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy I don't believe that you need to break Kompany's up but I don't even believe that the best for fastest path to restore the power that the governments especially the democratic governments are elected by the public should have we learned from Microsoft's own experience that while the government in our case 20 years ago actually pursue the break up of the company it could accomplish what it wanted in Munich with out doing that and you can move a lot faster as a government to do it a different way so let's talk about the raw nerve of regulation as you put it in the book used the word guard rail love the idea that you can find a way of working private sector the big tech companies working alongside the state government to develop a meaningful and effective guard rails to ensure that the public is well served tell me what you think the guard rail should look like we don't have today I think one should start by asking what problems we want to sign of and then you create guard rails to solve each time certainly we look around the world today there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved there are issues around privacy there are issues around cybersecurity there are issues around the use of artificial intelligence since the days of Facial recognition there are economic issues especially the impact technology is having on our jobs in the future of the economy</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. </p><p>Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-5dd2fc4ac86f447294d866694042c339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-KJS1-JBH6-C0Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-703f480ce9c04c1c99490542bd6364f5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3X-MCM1-DY08-31RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

what we had learned was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but the way other people size how we had to learn to connect with the world we need to assume more responsibility we needed to compromise and except regulation as it was imposed on us and here in that story I do think there are parallels for the tech sector is a Houghton because it was tempting of course this was personified by bill gates more than anybody else tempting to see this sort of QE QE extraordinarily smart business leaders in a new enterprise tech oriented who really was it was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge of course bill gates wasn't really like that at all just as Mark Zuckerberg more recently isn't really like that at all It's not just me who quickly he is a ruthless business man out to sucking every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market I think we're not into worse statement that Bruyne where I would suggest he is in the world of technology people start companies with a great idea and then moving very fast and I think one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast one should never move faster than the speed of fire and I think if you look at the history of digital technology it has had a tenancy at times for companies to move fast the old slogan was move fast and break things I think the new a straight red for a second that point I think Microsoft was was guilty of that in its determination to absolutely dominate and ruled the operating system market for PCs I think that what we learned was that we need to think more broadly there is a sea Verity of focus that you often find in a very successful tech companies Microsoft would be among them and then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact it's having on others other people in your industry the world is on a war is so much greater the draft a step back he and internalise that that's the key to accept more responsibility interesting so if that's the place that big Tech's that today you understand the cause of the being made across the political spectrum in the United States right now for the break up of the biggest companies know if we will name them then it would be Amazon on app for alphabet who of course have Google then be Microsoft and Facebook there are among a quote tube Senator Elizabeth Warren who formed presidential candidate of the Democratic party calling for the break up of those big companies because she says they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy I do believe we need to say strengthen the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy I don't believe that you need to break Kompany's up I don't even believe that the best for fastest path to restore the power that the governments especially democratic governments are elected by the public should have we learned from Microsoft's own experience that while the government in our case 20 years ago actually pursue the break up of the company it could accomplish what it wanted and needed with out doing that and you can move a lot faster as a government to do it a different way so let's talk about the raw nerve of regulation or you put it in the book used the word guard rails love the idea that you can find a way of working private sector the big tech companies working alongside the state government To meaningful and effective guard rails to ensure that the public is well served tell me what you think the guard rail should look like we don't have today I think one should start by asking what problems we want to sign of and then you create card real to solve each time certainly look around the world today there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved there are issues around privacy there are issues around cybersecurity there are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in saying something like facial recognition there are economic issues especially the impact technology is having on our jobs in the future of the economy and in some places in the world there are some guard rails in place saying in Europe but Brown something my privacy but almost everywhere you look I think we need additional guard rails we need to guard rails they will be essential for a decade had two Twenty20s start building Let's get specific

Let's get specific, specific and let's start with privacy and data and start with privacy and data because goodness knows technology allows every because goodness knows technology allows single one of us now to use our smartphones laptops every single one of us now to use our smartphones, our laptops and our tablets and tablets to acquire, use information to to acquire and use information and then bide and thereby to also provide information about ourselves also provide information about ourselves to tech to tech companies such as yours. companies such as yours now in the United States there is a In the United States law which in essence says the tech companies can't there is a law which essentially says be held legally responsible for online content that is on their platforms is it the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online content that is on their platforms. your contention that must now change Is it your contention that must now change? Actually, yes. actually Yes ascension to 30 in the communications It's section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. decency Act It was created 19 80s when the internet was just really taking off when the internet was just taking off, and the notion wires that the best way to enable and the notion was that the best way the internet to kick-off wise to give to to enable the internet to take off was to give internet interactive services immunity that journalists, networks, television, radio have traditionally faced for content. I don't think one should just abrogate what was created in the 90s because that will probably suffocate social media, but the time has come to accept there needs to be some exceptions and some new responsibilities for companies, including our own. You say including your own but the sceptic in me is thinking here is one of the top officials at Microsoft Corp, suggesting a change, making himself look like a real public spirited corporate leader, but actually a change which will hamstring Facebook, and Twitter and some other content carriers, it won't affect Microsoft at all.

first of these giant companies that ruthlessly exploited technology to dominate the market place I think that was actually a mistake the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft we made more than their share of mistakes and I think it's an interesting story because we had to learn part of what we had was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but the way other people size we had to learn to connect with the world we need to assume more responsibility we needed to compromise and except regulation as it was imposed on us and here in that story I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as Haute because it was tempting of course this was personified by bill gates more than anybody else tempting to see this sort of the key extraordinarily smart business leaders in a new enterprise tech oriented who really was it was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge but of course bill gates wasn't really like that for justice Mark Zuckerberg more recently isn't really like that at all is not just who are the key is a ruthless business man out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market I think we're that into worse statement that Brian whether I would suggest he is in the world of technology people start a company A good idea and then moving very fast and I think one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast one should never move faster than the speed of thought and I think if you look at the history of digital technology it has had a tenancy at times for companies to move fast the old slogan was move fast and break things I think the new a straight red for a second that point you think Microsoft was was guilty of that but in its determination to absolutely dominated ruled the operating system market for PCs I think the out what we learned was that we need to think more broadly there is a single yellow area of focus that you often find in a very successful tech companies Microsoft will be among them and then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact the sure having on others other people in your industry the world as a whore is so much greater the draft step back here and internalise that that's the key to accept more responsibility interesting so if that's the place that big Tech's that today do you understand the cause of the being made across the political spectrum in the United States right now for the break up of the biggest companies that if we will name them then they would be Amazon on Apple alphabet of course have Google them to be Microsoft and Facebook there are money will quote you Senator Elizabeth Warren who formed presidential candidate of the Democratic party calling for the break up of those big companies because she says they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy I do believe we need to say strengthen the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy I don't believe that you need to Break it up I don't even believe that the best for fastest path to restore the power that the governments especially in democratic governments are elected by the public should have we learned from Microsoft's own experience that while the government in our case 20 years ago actually pursue the break up of the company it could accomplish what it wanted and needed without doing that and you can move a lot faster as a government to do it a different way so let's talk about the rule of over-regulation hours you put in the book used the word God rest of the world an idea that the EU you can find a way of working private sector the big tech companies working alongside the state government to develop a meaningful and effective guard rails to ensure that the public is well served tell me what you think the guard rail should look like we don't have today I think why should start by asking what problems we want to sign of and

ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but the way other people stars we had to learn to connect with the world we needed to assume more responsibility we needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us and here in that story I do think there are parallels for the tech sector is Hall today it because it was tempting of course this was personified by bill gates more than anybody else tempting to see this sort of the key extraordinarily smart business leaders in a new enterprise tech oriented who really was we sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge of course bill gates wasn't really like that at all just as Mark Zuckerberg more recently isn't really like that at all is not just who they are the key is a ruthless business man out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his $ The market I think we're not the worst as a statement that Prime well I would suggest he is in the world of technology people start companies with a great idea and then moving very fast and I think one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast one should never move faster than the speed of fire and they think if you look at the history of digital technology it has had a tenancy at times for companies to move fast the old slogan was move fast and break things I think the new just for a second that point you think Microsoft was was guilty of about that in its determination to absolutely dominate and ruled the operating system market for pieces I think that what we learned was that we need to think more broadly in their areas the sing yellow area of focus that you often find in a very successful tech companies Microsoft will be among them and then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact the sure having on others other people in your industry the world is a war is so much greater the draft to step back he and internalise that that's the key accepting responsibility interesting so if that's the place that big Tech's that today you understand the cause of the being made across the political spectrum in the United States right now for the break up of the biggest companies know if we will name them then they would be Amazon on Apple alphabet of course have GoogleMicrosoft and Facebook there are among will quote you Senator Elizabeth Warren who formed presidential candidate of the Democratic party calling for the break up of those big companies because she says they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy I do believe we need to Ossie strengthen the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy I don't believe that you need to break Kompany's up I don't even believe that the best or fastest path to restore the power that the governments especially the democratic governments are elected by the public should have we learned from Microsoft on an experience that while the government in our case 20 years ago actually pursue the break up of the company it could accomplish what it wanted and needed with out doing that and you can move a lot faster as a government to do in a different way so let's talk about the rule of over-regulation hours you put it in the book used the word God real world an idea that you can find a way of working private sector the big tech companies working alongside the state government to develop meaningful and effective guard rails to ensure that the public is well served tell me what you think the guard rail should look like we don't have today I think why should start by asking what problems we want to sign of and the new credit card real to solve the crime certainly will look around the world today there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved there are issues around privacy there are issues around cybersecurity there are issues around the use of artificial intelligence and say something like facial recognition there are economic issues especially the impact technology is having on our jobs in the future of the economy and in some places in the world there are some guard rails in place saying in Europe but Brown something my privacy but almost everywhere you look I think we need additional guard rails we need to guard rails they will be essential for a decade had two Twenty20s start building Let's get specific go and start with privacy and data</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
