This pledge is known as the Christchurch Call. Two months ago, deadly attacks on Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, were livestreamed on Facebook. Here's New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JACINDA ARDERN:                 Christchurch Call to Action, an action plan for change, is a global response to a tragedy that occurred on the shores of my country but were ultimately felt around the world.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Now, the Trump administration has declined to endorse this pledge. John Edwards is New Zealand's privacy commissioner. He's on the line from Wellington, New Zealand. Good morning, Commissioner Edwards.             </p><p>JOHN EDWARDS:                 Good morning, Noel.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So let's start with the pledge. Facebook, Twitter, some other big tech companies, they all joined in. What are they agreeing to do?             </p><p>JOHN EDWARDS:                 Well, they're agreeing to participate in joint industry and government efforts to keep the Internet open and free but to stomp out the worst excesses of extremist violence. They've agreed to do that by being transparent, by having effective means of suppressing that most harmful of content. Governments have pledged to regulate where necessary. So it's not a treaty. It's just a start. It's a pledge to recognize the great harm that can be perpetrated over these platforms and to begin to work together to address that harm.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Well, as you point out, it's not legally binding. And some tech companies - Facebook jumps to mind - they faced a lot of criticism for not acting on this sooner. Do you, when you see this pledge, do you think it's going to lead to real change?             </p><p>JOHN EDWARDS:                 I think it's a really important first step. I was one of the people who criticized Facebook, and I don't resile from that criticism. I'm really pleased to see that Facebook has come out just ahead of the Christchurch Call conference to say that it has changed its livestreaming in a way that, in fact, would have prevented the perpetrator in Christchurch carrying out that livestreaming of his atrocity. That's pretty sobering.             </p><p>                You know, to me, that's really an important message for the tech industry, that when there is such a predictable harm and evil use that can be put to your technology, it is incumbent upon you to think about the ways that you mitigate that before launching it. I mean, we've got there now, thankfully, in one small measure. But they should have done this months and months ago, and it's just very sad.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 As I said, sir, the Trump administration did not sign on to this pledge. It cited its respect for, quote, \"freedom of expression and freedom of the press.\" Do you need the United States to sign on here? Is it important for the U.S. to agree to this?             </p><p>JOHN EDWARDS:                 Well, it's not what I need. I'm really just a commentator here, and I don't speak for the New Zealand government, and nor is it my place to criticize the administration of the United States. But what we have seen in Christchurch overnight, our time, is a commitment from 17 governments to address this scourge. And so I think whatever else happens, a growing consensus is emerging that industry and governments around the world will be unable to ignore and I think will be compelled to join.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 John Edwards is New Zealand's privacy commissioner. Thank you so much.             </p><p>JOHN EDWARDS:                 Thank you.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201905161004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W49-CM81-DY1J-T06T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 16, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The CDC found traces of COVID-19 on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2014 17 days after passengers had left the cabins. Of note, the cabins had yet to be disinfected. While the data doesn't show if transmission occurred from surfaces, the CDC report recommends exploring that further. The report outlines the responses on board several high-profile cruise ships, including both the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess. Between the ships, there were more than 800 COVID-19 cases that led to 10 deaths.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/princess-cruise.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/princess-cruise.png</url> The Diamond Princess had traces of coronavirus lasting 17 days. 'Florida's budget to take big hit as sales taxes collapse[10]' via Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Florida's finances are about to get hit. Hard. That's because some of the industries that have been forced into near-complete shutdowns as part of the effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus are also some of the same industries that Florida leans upon most heavily to prop up the state budget. Restaurants, hotels and admissions \u2014 from venues like theme parks, movie theaters and sporting events \u2014 account for 20% of state sales tax collections, according to data from the Florida Department of Revenue. And the economic shock from COVID-19 has already radiated far beyond tourism and hospitality businesses. Commercial landlords, the state's fourth-largest source of sales tax receipts, have seen tenants stop paying rent. Tweet, tweet: Why not push to get REC info? In today's @orlandosentinel[11] talks about how state finances are going to get hit hard. We should at a minimum look at sales tax collection data that comes in on April. Amy Baker is even quoted saying they're working on models for pandemics. #FlaPol[12]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/kyG0Sm4Fvz\">https://t.co/kyG0Sm4Fvz</url>[13] \u2014 Jimmy Patronis (@JimmyPatronis) March 24, 2020[14]'Betsy DeVos halts collection of defaulted federal student loans[15]' via Michael Stratford of POLITICO \u2014 The Education Department is putting a stop to collecting on defaulted federal student loans amid the coronavirus pandemic and ordering private collection firms to stop pursuing borrowers 'until further notice,' according to a memo to the companies. The department plans to make the policy retroactive to March 13, the day Trump declared a national emergency, the official said. The new executive actions provide a reprieve for the more than 9 million federal student loan borrowers who are in default on their debt. The decision to halt the debt collection comes as congressional Democrats, labor unions and consumer advocacy groups urged Education Secretary DeVos to hit pause during the pandemic on the sweeping powers that the federal government has to pursue borrowers. \u2014 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u2014 \u2014@HillaryClinton: Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse. \u2014@NYGovCuomo: We are not willing to sacrifice 1-2% of New Yorkers.

'We're going to be opening relatively soon,' Trump said. 'I'd love to have it open by Easter It's such an important day for other reasons, but I'll make an important date for this too. I would love to have the country, opened up and just raring to go by Easter.' Asked if it's possible to return to normal by Easter, Trump said: 'I think it's absolutely possible.

Image via AP.; 'The struggle to argue for opening the economy without sounding as if you're OK with more people dying[23]' via Amber Phillips of The Washington Post \u2014 Here's a massive messaging problem facing Trump as he indicates he wants to curtail his administration's social-distancing recommendations as soon as next week: How do you argue for reopening the economy when science says doing so will cost lives? Trump's comments have driven to the forefront of a public debate over whether and when to put people back together in public. Those who think we should, and soon, are struggling with how to articulate that in a way that doesn't sound callous. They haven't been successful. The chief example of this is Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is 69, old enough to be in a high-risk category for the virus. He literally said he would be willing to risk his life to go back to work. 'Hopes for united fight against coronavirus recession hurt by nations' go-it-alone style[24]' via David J. Lynch of The Washington Post \u2014 The United States and other major governments have made little progress coordinating their spending, trade and tax policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic, instead bowing to nationalist sentiments as a global economic downturn intensifies, according to economists and former government officials. On Tuesday, there was a sign that might be changing with a joint statement by the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven nations that promised 'whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth' and urged all countries to take steps to offset the deepening economic decline. Yet more than three years of Trump's uncompromising 'America First' approach is taking its toll on crisis-fighting efforts. 'Congress, White House close in on $2 trillion stimulus deal to blunt coronavirus fallout[25]' via Erica Werner, Mike DeBonis, Paul Kane and Jeff Stein of The Washington Post \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin \u2014 the top White House negotiator \u2014 all said they expected resolution imminently. However, lawmakers were still reviewing details, and the situation was fluid and could quickly change. The package would extend extraordinary \u2014 and unprecedented \u2014 taxpayer assistance to potentially millions of American and foreign companies that have been hammered by the fast-moving economic crisis. It would extend one-time cash payments to most Americans, aimed at flooding the economy with money. The bill is being rushed through Congress without public hearings or formal review, and it's unclear how effective the measures would be in arresting the economy's sudden fall. 'Nancy Pelosi proposal would ban corporations receiving coronavirus aid from lobbying[26]' via Theodoric Meyer of POLITICO \u2014 House Democrats drafted the bill, the text of which is circulating on K Street, even as Pelosi also negotiated with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer this weekend on a separate package that McConnell is trying to pass through the upper chamber. A procedural vote to advance the Senate bill failed. While McConnell's bill includes some restrictions on how much companies that receive coronavirus relief loans, Pelosi's proposal goes much further. House Democrats' bill would ban corporations from paying bonuses to their executives or paying any compensation to fired executives until the corporations repay their coronavirus relief loans to the federal government. 'Trump will use Defense Production Act to secure thousands of test kits[27]' via Quint Forgey, Sarah Owermohle and Megan Cassella of POLITICO \u2014 FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the Trump administration would formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment sorely needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. 'So, just a little while ago, my team came in, and we're actually going to use the DPA for the first time today,' Gaynor told CNN. The FEMA Administrator said triggering the act would help access 'about 60,000 test kits,' and added that the administration would insert 'DPA language' into the mass contracts for the federal government's order of 500 million personal protective masks. 'Health care workers might get coronavirus shots this fall, vaccine company CEO says[28]' via Arthur Allen of POLITICO \u2014 By the fall the FDA would at best have only initial data on the vaccine's safety and its ability to produce antibodies and shape an immune response. The vaccine by then might have been tested in a few hundred people who probably wouldn't have been exposed to the disease.

'Volunteers sew masks for health workers facing shortages[29]' via Tammy Webber, Dee-Ann Durbin and Anne D'Innocenzio of The Associated Press \u2014 Scores of people are answering pleas from hospitals, doctors and nurses so desperate for personal protective equipment amid the viral pandemic that they've turned to the public, saying do-it-yourself face masks are better than nothing. And for those sitting at home worrying as the virus strains hospitals and the economy teeters, sewing masks makes them feel less helpless. Deaconess spokeswoman Pam Hight said the hospital system realized it could face a shortage if local infections skyrocket like they have elsewhere. So officials produced and posted a how-to video that has been shared across the country. 'Key medical glove factories cutting staff 50% amid virus[30]' via Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza of The Associated Press \u2014 Malaysia's medical glove factories, which make most of the world's critical hand protection, are operating at half capacity just when they're most needed. Health care workers snap gloves on as the first line of protection against catching COVID-19 from patients, and they're crucial to protecting patients as well. But medical-grade glove supplies are running low globally, even as more feverish, sweating and coughing patients arrive in hospitals by the day. Malaysia is by far the world's largest medical glove supplier, producing as many as three out of four gloves on the market. The industry has a history of mistreating migrant workers who toil over hand-sized molds as they're dipped in melted latex or rubber, hot and exhausting work. 'Coronavirus in N.Y.: 'Astronomical' surge leads to quarantine warning[31]' via Alan Feuer and Brian M. Rosenthal of The New York Times \u2014 Federal and state officials expressed growing alarm on Tuesday about the coronavirus outbreak in New York City, warning that it could reach its peak much sooner than expected and advising people who have passed through or left the city that they should place themselves in a 14-day quarantine. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, indicated that the health authorities were now treating the New York City region as a coronavirus hot zone, akin to areas of China and Europe overwhelmed by the virus. Dr. Birx said that about 60% of all the new cases in the United States were in the New York City metropolitan area, adding that a surge in cases on Long Island showed that people leaving the city were spreading the virus. ''Cacophony of coughing': Inside NYC's virus-besieged ERs[32]' via Michael Sisak, Jim Mustian and Jennifer Peltz of The Associated Press \u2014 Faced with an infection rate that is five times that of the rest of the country, health workers are putting themselves at risk to fight a tide of sickness that's getting worse by the day amid a shortage of needed supplies and promises of help from the federal government that have yet to materialize fully. 'You're on 100% of the time \u2014 no matter what,' said Dr. Jolion McGreevy, medical director of The Mount Sinai Hospital emergency department. 'It's been a month of full force, and that's certainly very stressful.' Nearly 14,800 people in New York City have been diagnosed with coronavirus as of Tuesday, accounting for more than half the cases in the hardest-hit state in the nation. Um no, they're not \u2014 'Texas' Lieutenant Governor suggests grandparents are willing to die for U.S. economy[33]' via Adrianna Rodriguez of USA TODAY \u2014 The Lieutenant Governor of Texas argued in an interview on Fox News Monday night that the United States should go back to work, saying grandparents like him don't want to sacrifice the country's economy during the coronavirus crisis. Republican Lt. Gov. Patrick, 69, made the comments on Fox News' 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' after Trump said he wanted to reopen the country for business in weeks, not months. Patrick also said the elderly population, who the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted are more at risk for COVID-19, can take care of themselves and suggested that grandparents wouldn't want to sacrifice their grandchildren's economic future.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PATRICK.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PATRICK.jpg</url>Texas Lt.

'Spring break partier apologizes: 'Don't be arrogant and think you're invincible'[34]' via James Weber of the Cincinnati Enquirer \u2014 The Milford High School graduate who gained notoriety last week for indulging in spring-break partying during a pandemic despite warnings against large gatherings has apologized. Brady Sluder said he has realized he's not invincible after all. 'I wasn't aware of the severity of my actions and comments,' Sluder posted in an apology on his Instagram account on March 22. 'I'd like to take this time to own up to the mistakes I've made and apologize to the people I've offended.' Sluder drew attention for a TV interview from Miami. in which he downplayed the seriousness of the new coronavirus pandemic.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html;\">https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html;</url> \u2014 CORONAFLORIDA \u2014 'Ron DeSantis asks Trump to declare Florida major disaster as death toll increases[35]' via Dan DeLuca and Evan Pflugradt of TC Palm \u2014 DeSantis sent a letter to Trump formally requesting that he declare a major disaster as Florida responds to COVID-19. The letter requested the inclusion of the following Individual Assistance Programs in the declaration: Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Community Disaster Loans and the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Program. The declaration is submitted as a result of the COVID-19 response for the incident period beginning Jan. 20, for all 67 counties.

'#8216;Dumbest s\u2014': DeSantis takes heat as he goes his own way on coronavirus[36]' via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida \u2014 While New York, California and other states shutter their economies to keep the coronavirus at bay, DeSantis is refusing to follow the herd. His cure-can't-be-worse-than-the-disease approach has put the Republican Governor under a glaring spotlight locally and nationally as cases of the virus in Florida surge past 1,400. It's a philosophy that aligns DeSantis with other conservatives, including Trump and Florida House Speaker Jos Oliva. 'That is the dumbest s\u2014 I have heard in a long time,' said state Sen. Oscar Braynon. 'This is a day-by-day crisis. Italy damn near saw 1,000 people die in one day, and there are people proclaiming we got this, and have it solved in 15 days?' 'Lawmakers continue calls for Governor to issue stay-at-home order[37]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is continuing to push DeSantis to close all nonessential businesses and issue a statewide shelter-in-place order amid the COVID-19 virus outbreak. So far, DeSantis has rebuffed those calls, leaving the decision to local governments most impacted by the virus. Sens. Jos Javier Rodrguez and Annette Taddeo \u2014 both of whom represent parts of Miami-Dade County \u2014 were among the batch of Senators who released statements pushing DeSantis for additional action. 'Strong measures taken now to reduce the rate of transmission will prevent a catastrophic breakdown of our health care system and save lives,' Rodrguez said. 'DeSantis bucking advice of health professionals, local and state lawmakers[38]' via Jeff Schweers of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Against the urging of state and local leaders and national health professionals, DeSantis has refused to order a statewide shutdown of all nonessential businesses and mandate that all residents stay at home to help prevent a wider spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Meantime, the number of Florida cases continues to rise. As of 6 p.m. Tuesday, the number of positive cases rose to 1,467, with 1,379 of those Florida residents and 88 nonresidents. There are now 20 Florida deaths listed. 'You have some people who say this virus is much ado about nothing. I was never in that camp and said it was a serious public health threat,' DeSantis said during a televised news conference. ''Wishy-washy' coronavirus response from DeSantis draws comparisons to Trump[39]' via Steven Lemongello of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 DeSantis appears to be in lockstep with Trump in response to the coronavirus outbreak by refusing to order residents to stay at home and casting blame at Democratic-led states for the crisis \u2014 positions that frustrate critics calling for an immediate lockdown of the state. Several cities and counties, including Orange and Leon counties and Tampa, issued stay-at-home orders of their own, without waiting for DeSantis. The response to the outbreak has been largely patchwork from state to state, with DeSantis and other Governors holding back on ordering shutdowns while others, like New York's Andrew Cuomo and Ohio's Mike DeWine, have issued strict shelter-in-place orders. Within Florida, the responses have been what Rep. Sen. Lori Berman called a 'piecemeal approach.' 'Wave of claims swamps Florida's unemployment agency. 'It is impossible to get through'[40]' via Alex Harris and Lawrence Mower of the Miami Herald \u2014 Frustrated applicants have flooded social media to report a slew of problems: getting kicked off the website by errors, getting locked out of accounts and failure at reaching a human being on the phone \u2014 no matter how often they call. Anthony White, a bartender at the Nautilus Hotel in South Beach, said he sets his alarm every morning so he can call the unemployment office the moment it opens. It's still not early enough. White is one of the tens of thousands turning to the state Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency in charge of Florida's unemployment benefits. Many are finding an agency that's understaffed and unprepared for the onslaught. 'Florida's coronavirus quarantine for New Yorkers: Plane landed. Now what?[41]' via Allison Ross and Douglas R. Clifford \u2014 The flight from Newark, New Jersey, landed at Tampa International Airport only 12 minutes after DeSantis' executive order went into effect. Most of the 14 passengers scattered throughout the plane had not yet heard that DeSantis had ordered all travelers like them to self-quarantine for two weeks upon landing. Clutching copies of the three-page executive order provided by a JetBlue crew member, the passengers on JetBlue Flight 905 collected their bags and dispersed across Tampa Bay into the quiet night. It's unclear how, or if, authorities will keep tabs on them. 'Ashley Moody, Nikki Fried warn of scams, price gouging[42]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 Attorney General Moody and Agriculture Commissioner Fried are trying to focus attention on scams and price gouging that stem from the crisis. Scams include text messages claiming to offer victims yet-to-be-approved stimulus package money, crooks going door-to-door in lab coats posing as federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees, and seniors being offered free COVID-19 test kits in exchange for personal information. Also, as of Monday night, Moody's office had received 628 complaints about price gouging related to products such as cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer and face masks. 'Question mark on use of Medicaid for COVID-19 testing[43]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 States have been given authority to extend Medicaid to help pay the costs of COVID-19 testing for uninsured residents under a federal coronavirus relief measure passed last week. But DeSantis avoided directly answering whether Florida would take advantage of the new policy, which would allow the full costs of testing uninsured adults to be borne by the state Medicaid program. DeSantis said Florida would make sure people can get free tests and access to any necessary follow-up care. 'The thing I would say to people about the coronavirus is, if you are somebody who is symptomatic and you go in, you are going to get a free test,' DeSantis said. 'We are going to treat everybody.' 'Advocacy groups release plan to prevent COVID-19 outbreak at correctional facilities[44]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics \u2014 'As our country takes measures to protect against coronavirus, we can't afford to forget about the millions of people under the control of our criminal justice system,' said Jessica Jackson, Chief Advocacy Officer at REFORM Alliance. The plan has five prongs and goes by the acronym 'SAFER.' The recommendations: Suspend jail for technical violations; suspend probation office visits and payment of fines; adopt smart alternatives to incarceration; free medical visits and treatment, hand sanitizer, soap, and protective gear; extra precautions for guards and staff; release elderly and vulnerable to home confinement. 'Mike Caruso tests negative for coronavirus after having to miss budget vote[45]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 Rep. Caruso says he tested negative for the COVID-19 virus after feeling ill last week and missing an in-person vote on the state's budget. He eventually decided to get tested at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital (TMH) on March 16. 'I had a fever of 101 when I got to the hospital,' Caruso said. Caruso said the COVID-19 test came back negative on Saturday. But Caruso did test positive for a variant of the flu. Caruso said he's feeling well now, and the symptoms have passed, but he does note his wife is now feeling sick. He described her symptoms like a headache, aches, high temperature and cough. Caruso said he would seek to get her tested for the COVID-19 coronavirus as well if those symptoms don't improve. 'Are we moving about less? Fascinating commercial website tracking us says yes[46]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014Unacast, a New York-based data crunching consultant, has unveiled its pro bono COVID-19 toolkit with the first tool rating states and counties on whether the GPS data is showing that people, indeed, are going nowhere now. The company has been tracking people[47] by device GPS for years, so it has a baseline of what 'normal' travel behavior is in each county and state. The grades are based on how much that has changed in the past couple of weeks. In many, the changes have been profound, with drop-offs of 30%, 40%, 50% or more in total movement of people with trackable devices. The company's Social Distancing Scoreboard[48], rolled out Tuesday, gives Florida a B grade overall, based on an overall score of a 39% reduction of travel compared with normal. An A grade goes to places that topped 40%.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tgh.org/;\">https://www.tgh.org/;</url> \u2014 CORONA LOCAL \u2014 'A new study shows we're already in a coronavirus recession \u2014 and it has hit South Florida hard[49]' via Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald \u2014 A new study by the StratoDem Analytics data firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, suggests economists' fear was spot-on. The coronavirus isn't putting us at risk of a recession. The COVID-19 recession is already here \u2014 especially in tourism-centric South Florida. 'There is no question whatsoever that America slipped into a recession in March 2020,' said James Chung, a partner at StratoDem Analytics. 'The big question is how deep it's going to get and where it's going to hurt the most.' Using forecasts from large financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, the study finds the national gross domestic product (GDP) during Q2 of 2020 (April 1-June 30) will average -18.1%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/south-florida.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/south-florida.jpg</url> South Florida is in a full-fledged coronavirus recession.

The health department's data list the boy's age as zero, making him the youngest person in the state known to be ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Health officials have also listed the case under 'unknown' for travel-related. DOH did not state whether the baby boy had been in contact with someone who had tested positive for the virus. State health officials have also listed the 2-year-old girl's case under 'unknown' for travel-related and did not indicate whether she had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. 'Miami-Dade orders 10-person limit on all public gatherings except on transit[51]' via Joey Flechas of the Miami Herald \u2014 County Mayor Carlos Gimnez issued an order limiting the number of people who gather in public to 10 in an effort to further push residents to practice social distancing and curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Tuesday's order marks another escalation in the local government's efforts to stop people from congregating, urge social distancing and prevent more infections. The order makes an exception for people on public transit vehicles, those waiting at a bus stop, Metromover stop or Metrorail stop, and those traveling in larger vehicles that can fit more than 10. There are also exceptions for government employees and contractors working for the government who are providing services on public streets, alleys and sidewalks. 'More testing is available for COVID-19, but getting results can take days or more[52]' via Daniel Chang of the Miami Herald \u2014 Tests can take 24 to 48 hours to turn around once a sample is placed in an analyzing machine, experts say. But the long wait for results can be due to a number of factors, from the growing number of tests being processed during the pandemic to the type of machine that runs the test and whether the test involves a hospitalized patient or a police officer or firefighter, whose test are prioritized. Most of the testing sites operated by the state in partnership with local governments and hospitals are advising people that results can take three to five days, though one hospital official running a private testing site said he has been delivering results in under two days. 'Monroe County to close U.S. 1 to tourists into the Florida Keys due to COVID-19 concerns[53]' via David Goodhue and Gwen Filosa of the Miami Herald \u2014 The county decided to place a checkpoint on U.S. 1 at mile marker 112.5 on the 18-mile stretch leading to Florida City on the mainland. There will also be another one on State Road 905, Card Sound Road, which is the other, less-traveled road into the Keys, said Kristen Livengood, the county's spokeswoman. Monroe County Mayor Heather Carruthers said during a news conference that there were no immediate plans to close the road. It's not immediately clear what changed, but Sheriff Rick Ramsay, who said he was not the one to make the decision, said many city leaders in the Keys wanted the highway closed to tourists. 'Opposition mounts against letting ship with 77 sick people dock at Port Everglades[54]' via Lisa J. Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Fearful of the new coronavirus spreading more quickly in South Florida, two Broward County commissioners and a state representative want to stop a ship from docking in Port Everglades. The boat has 77 people showing symptoms, and local leaders worry it would be a health risk to let them disembark. The Holland America cruise ship called Zaandam is hoping to end its voyage at Port Everglades on March 30 after being denied permission to dock in Chile. At an emergency meeting Tuesday, County Commissioner Michael Udine said he wanted the port to turn the ship away. He argues the passengers boarded this ship after the coronavirus was well-known to be an issue. 'They knowingly put themselves at risk,' Udine said. 'Under no circumstances should that ship be at Port Everglades.'

'Meet the Jupiter scientists on the front lines of finding a vaccine[56]' via Sean Howard of the Palm Beach Post \u2014 Dozens of scientists at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter are banding together in the global push to develop drugs and vaccines needed to wind down the coronavirus pandemic. At last count, 37 scientists at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, plus another 100 at Scripps facilities in California, are working on coronavirus research, Director of Communications Stacey Singer DeLoye said. Their work largely falls under three categories: research to help develop drugs, vaccines and antibody treatments, said Michael Farzan, a professor who co-chairs Scripps's Department of Immunology and Microbiology. 'We don't know that anything's going to be helpful but everybody's trying to provide some helpful piece on the margins, hoping to pull everyone forward,' said Farzan, who is based in Jupiter. 'Leon County issues 'stay-at-home order,' curfew amid coronavirus pandemic[57]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 While the Governor has rejected calls for a statewide lockdown, local officials in Tallahassee announced a 'stay-at-home order' Tuesday following the lead of other areas with confirmed cases of coronavirus around the state. Large public gatherings were halted almost two weeks ago as the virus began to spread throughout, and tests slowly began to be administered more readily. Tuesday's stay-at-home order by Leon County Commission Chairman Bryan Desloge and Mayor John Dailey set restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people to go into effect at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Any gathering of more than 10 people would be dispersed by law enforcement and punishable by a fine. A curfew from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. also goes into effect Wednesday. 'Lee County school board to hold first virtual meeting, but does it meet Sunshine Law?[58]' via Pamela McCabe of the Fort Myers News-Press \u2014 Keeping in line with directives from the Florida Department of Education and DeSantis, the Lee County school board will meet via a virtual, call-in meeting that will be posted on the school district's YouTube channel. But questions had been raised whether the 1 p.m. meeting is a violation of Sunshine Law. As of 6:30 p.m. Monday, the plan was for the meeting to be recorded and then posted online, but the district has since decided to stream the meeting live on YouTube. At this time, the district is 'not encouraging' people to show up at the board room, housed in the Lee County Public Education Center on Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers. 'Orange County stay-at-home order given, starts Thursday[59]' via Ryan Gillespie and Stephen Hudak of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 The order will take effect at 11 p.m. Thursday and covers all 13 municipalities in the county. It is an attempt to 'flatten the curve' \u2014 or ensure that medical facilities aren't overwhelmed as more cases of the virus emerge. Only people traveling for essential business, including trips to work, the grocery store or pharmacy, will be allowed on the streets. The order will be in effect for two weeks, but Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said it could be extended then. Residents are allowed to exercise outside but are discouraged from doing so in groups. 'Welcome to Orlando. You're from New York?

The airport might wind up screening them when they get off the planes, and isolating them in a room for processing. DeSantis, on Monday, ordered that visitors from those three states undergo 14 days of quarantine or self-isolation, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is particularly rampant in those states.

'West Palm restaurateur makes a passionate plea to city \u2014 we need help and fast[63]' via Tony Doris of the Palm Beach Post \u2014 Last Friday was the worst day of Rodney Mayo's life thanks to the coronavirus. With state orders to close restaurants except for takeout, the lifelong West Palm Beach resident, whose Subculture Group owns 17 restaurants and bars, laid off 650 employees. By 4 a.m. Saturday, though, he had a plan: to turn his Howley's restaurant at 4700 S Dixie Highway into a production line for free meals for hospitality employees, seniors and others laid off. With a rehired kitchen staff and a small army of volunteers, Mayo's effort provided more than 5,000 meals in its first three days.

'Unfortunately, I have found the dissemination of information to the public to be atrocious,' Capote wrote.

According to The New York Times, as of last week, more than 4,500 of the Red Cross' blood drives have been canceled, resulting in nearly 150,000 fewer donations. OneBlood, another blood donation group, has posted similar dire numbers. That's what led Rep. Adam Hattersley to organize a blood drive event Tuesday. ''More eyes on our community': Lawmen concerned about youth crime during coronavirus threat[67]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Law enforcement in Tallahassee is stepping up to make sure its officers are more visible while businesses are all but empty and schools are closed. But it is still too early to tell what effect, if any, a quasi-lockdown will have on capital city crime. The Leon County Sheriff's Office has about 30 more deputies available for patrols from staff that would normally work at schools or in the courthouse. 'We're trying to be as innovative as we can in those deployments to make sure that criminal element knows we're out,' said Sheriff Walt McNeil.

The message: Don't travel to Florida for Passover next month and risk spreading the novel coronavirus. 'To all those from out of state considering spending Pesach here in Florida: It's Halachically prohibited and medically irresponsible to come for Pesach,' the letter begins. In other words, the letter suggests, traveling for Passover would be a breach of Jewish religious law. Passover this year runs from April 8 to 16.

The private, nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research will make the formal call, probably next year, after looking back on the data. A common rule of thumb is that recessions are characterized by at least two quarters \u2014 six months \u2014 of falling gross domestic product, though the bureau itself says they're not always defined that way. Some economists have dispensed with the formalities because of how quickly spending has slowed or stopped in major sectors of the economy.

'In Florida, most gig workers can't get unemployment.

Those figures likely include writers, designers and coders but undercount the number of Uber and Lyft drivers, of which there are thousands in the region. Now, as the U.S. and South Florida economies grind to a halt, these workers face extraordinary uncertainty. That's because, according to legal experts, most gig workers cannot file for unemployment benefits.

With large swaths of Europe on coronavirus lockdown, pets across the Continent are suddenly having to get used to having their human companions around 24 hours a day. While some are responding with puppyish glee, others seem less than thrilled. 'He's visibly unhappy,' said Sara Polo of her Siberian cat Baloo, with whom she shares her Madrid apartment. Before the Spanish government put the country in lockdown, Polo spent most weekdays at work and weekends out of town, meaning her furry friend had the apartment pretty much to himself. 'He can't make sense of why I am here,' she said. 'When I try to work out in the living room, he attacks my yoga mat.' \u2014 THE HUMAN TOLL \u2014 'Coronavirus adds peril to the already at-risk: 'if I get this stuff, it's going to kill me.'[87]' via Cleve Wootson of The Washington Post \u2014 As millions of Americans distance themselves from one another in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the struggle is particularly acute for those whose existing ailments can be fatally exacerbated by the disease \u2014 people whose lungs have been compromised by pulmonary disorders, whose immune systems have been suppressed by chemotherapy or whose blood sugar spikes dangerously as their bodies fight even common colds. They have become the most stringent of the social distancers, filling refrigerators and medicine cabinets and hoping that supplies last until the worst is over. Wary of hospital waiting rooms filled with coughing people, when they get sick, they are turning to self-diagnosis and, at times, simply guessing. And they clean. A lot. ''I don't feel safe at all.' As cruise ships sail on, crews fear COVID-19 infection[88]' via Taylor Dolven of the Miami Herald \u2014 As the number of people infected on cruise ships continues to climb each day, cruise companies are still downplaying the risk of COVID-19 transmission at sea. 'Cruise ships are not a source for coronavirus,' said Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald in an interview with Axios. 'We have hundreds of cruise ships out there A cruise ship is not a riskier environment.' The CDC has released evidence to the contrary. Approximately 200 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. across 15 states were confirmed to be returned cruise travelers from Feb. 3-March 13. More than 25 cruise ship voyages have had confirmed cases of COVID-19, and at least 10 deaths have been linked to cruise ship travel. 'Handling your kid's disappointment when everything is canceled[89]' via Erinne Magee of The New York Times \u2014 Whether they're forced to skip a musical performance, a tryout for a spring sport, a visit to their grandparents or a family vacation, merely telling children that disappointment is a part of life doesn't cut it. In fact, breaking this news may also spark anxiety in parents. So how can parents help kids process their disappointment? I asked a few experts for their advice. First, check your own emotions. When breaking the news of cancellations, parents should focus on validating their children's emotions, whether that is disappointment or fear or something in between, said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, M.D., child and adolescent psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. \u2014 ONE GOOD THING \u2014 From her Washington, D.C., home, Donna Borak hosts free virtual meditation class daily for anyone who is looking for 'a respite during such a moment of uncertainty.' Borak invites everyone to join in: children, loved ones or pets. 'Even your plants.' As social distancing has become crucial to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, people worldwide are turning to technology to overcome physical barriers. They establish new connections and comforting others overwhelmed by unwelcome news about the virus or burdened by sudden economic hard times.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Borak.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Borak.jpeg</url> In this combination of frame grabs from Donna Borak's online meditation session hosted over Zoom, she leads a group to help ease the stress of isolation from Washington.

MATTERS \u2014 'Trump agencies steadily push rollbacks as pandemic rages[90]' via Ellen Knickmeyer of The Associated Press \u2014 As Americans stockpiled food and medicine and retreated indoors and businesses shuttered in hopes of riding out COVID-19, federal agencies in recent days moved forward on rollbacks that included a widely opposed deregulatory action by the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposed rule would require disclosure of the raw data behind any scientific study used in the rule-making process. That includes confidential medical records that opponents say could be used to identify people. Federal agencies should suspend steps toward enactment for any nonessential rule changes, Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, one of those signing the appeal, said in a separate email. 'Coronavirus is fueling Rick Scott's embrace of government' viaGary Fineoutof POLITICO \u2014Scott came to politics fed up with big government and riding the tea party wave after the financial crisis a decade ago.

'Charlie Crist calls for early release of benefits to support low-income families during coronavirus crisis[92]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 Crist sent a letter to DeSantis asking him to release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits early as low-income and vulnerable Floridians take steps to shelter in place during the coronavirus pandemic. Crist wants SNAP recipients to have access to their April benefits now so they can stock up on enough food to limit necessary trips to the grocery store. 'The Centers for Disease Control has requested that individuals practice social distancing, limiting their contact with others. However, most recipients of SNAP benefits do not have the resources needed to live at home for an extended period, living hand to mouth on monthly payments to purchase the food that they need to feed themselves and their families,' Crist wrote. Awww, that's too bad \u2014 'NRA to cut salaries, brace for layoffs as coronavirus disrupts fundraising, internal memo states[93]' via Beth Reinhard of The Washington Post \u2014 More than 800 people worked at the NRA in 2018, according to its latest tax filing. However, that number includes part-time workers who would not be affected by the reductions. Schedules for hourly workers will be reduced from five to four days a week, the memo said. Some top NRA officials, including chief executive Wayne LaPierre, are taking salary reductions greater than 20%. In 2018, compensation for top officials, including LaPierre, surged by 41% and legal fees more than tripled even as the organization sharply reduced spending on programs central to its mission. LaPierre received a total of about $2.2 million from the NRA and related entities in 2018, including a base salary of $1.27 million. \u2014 STATEWIDE \u2014 'DeSantis faces virus outbreak, veto requests[94]' via Jim Turner of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist wants DeSantis to veto legislation targeting e-cigarettes (SB 810). Supporters of the group 1000 Friends of Florida are being encouraged to tell DeSantis to nix a bill (SB 410) that would change how most county governments manage growth. A coalition of voting-rights groups called on DeSantis to reject a measure (SB 1794) that would impose a series of new restrictions on ballot initiatives.

Environmentalists want Governor to veto water bill \u2014 On Tuesday, dozens of environmental groups banded together to urge DeSantis to veto his priority bill setting new water quality regulations in the state, Bruce Ritchie of POLITICO Florida reports. The groups say the bill, which directs local governments to draft plans for septic tanks and sewage treatment plants, doesn't make meaningful regulatory changes 'Florida's waters are polluted because our regulatory system is broken and those in charge of protecting our waters are unduly influenced by polluters and their lobbyists,' the groups wrote in a letter. Conversely, the Governor has lauded the plan, a strong indication he will sign the legislation into law. 'Ashley Moody issue subpoenas for price gouging[95]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 Moody said she issued more than 40 subpoenas because of alleged price gouging on 'essential commodities' through accounts on Amazon. The subpoenas, which went to third-party sellers who use Amazon, involve allegations of excessive prices on items such as face masks, hand sanitizers and disinfectants during a state of emergency declared because of the coronavirus. 'Floridians are searching for essential products needed to stay safe and healthy during this COVID-19 pandemic,' Moody said in a prepared statement. 'Sadly, when they find these products for sale online, they often discover that the price tag makes them unattainable. This is unacceptable and unlawful.' 'If Florida shuts down, will medical marijuana dispensaries stay open?[96]' via Samantha J. Gross of the Miami Herald \u2014 As municipalities like Miami-Dade and Broward counties have started to close nonessential businesses in an attempt to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, they have exempted what are deemed 'essential' businesses like health care providers, gas stations, banks and news outlets. But what about medical marijuana treatment centers? They'll remain open for business. According to statute, the dispensaries are considered an essential service and are to be treated like retail pharmacies. Many of the dispensaries use delivery services to get medication to patients, as well as offer drive-thru windows or online ordering and pick up at the stores. 'Receiver opposed in domestic violence coalition case[97]' via Dara Kam of the News Service of Florida \u2014 A nonprofit foundation supporting the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence is asking a circuit judge to reverse a recent decision that put the embattled agency under the control of a receiver. The decision by Leon County Circuit Judge Ronald Flury, at the request of Attorney General Ashley Moody, came amid investigations into allegedly exorbitant executive compensation paid to Tiffany Carr, the former CEO of the coalition and the head of the foundation. Moody early this month filed an emergency motion asking Flury to put the coalition and its fundraising arm, the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence Foundation, in the hands of a receiver and to preserve the assets of both organizations. 'Jury trials to remain suspended through mid-April[98]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 As the novel coronavirus continues to spread throughout the state, Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Canady has extended the suspension of jury trials and other in-person court proceedings through April 17. Canady's order extends deadlines in previous administrative orders aimed at complying with health officials' recommendations to curb COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. In a video message, Canady addressed the impact of COVID-19 on the state's justice system. 'We are all facing an unprecedented challenge. The pandemic is now affecting everyone. We are living our lives in a way that none of us would have contemplated a few short weeks ago,' the chief justice said. 'New UCF president could get $600K annual pay[99]' via Annie Martin of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Incoming UCF President Alexander Cartwright could be entitled to an annual salary of $600,000 \u2014 20% higher than his predecessor's pay \u2014 according to a proposed five-year contract up for university trustees' approval on Tuesday morning. The University of Central Florida trustees tapped Cartwright to serve as the school's next president last Friday, selecting him unanimously over one other finalist. They're slated to vote on a contract for Cartwright with a proposed salary of nearly 20% more than what he earns in his current role as chancellor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Cartwright's contract with UCF would start on April 13. His appointment is subject to approval from the Board of Governors. 'Another area code eyed for Tampa area[100]' via Jim Turner of the News Service of Florida \u2014 The North American Numbering Plan Administrator, which oversees telephone numbering across the U.S. and other countries, has proposed creating what is known as an 'all-services overlay' as numbers in the 813 area code \u2014 all of Hillsborough County, Oldsmar in Pinellas County and parts of Pasco County \u2014 are forecast to be exhausted during the third quarter of 2022. Under the plan, which the Florida Public Service Commission will consider, a new area code would be added \u2014 or overlaid \u2014 in the same area. Current customers would keep the 813 area code and their numbers, but new customers and additional lines would receive the new area code.

Few are willing to predict with any certainty how the events of the last few weeks will affect what is still expected to be a close election in November. But Democrats are hopeful that the crisis will put into sharp relief the arguments they have been making for months.

'Two political handicappers say the Electoral College map now leans toward Democrats[104]' via Chris Cillizza of CNN \u2014 In the past five days, two of the most prominent nonpartisan political analysts in the country have released new projections that show presumptive Democratic nominee Biden with a clear edge over Trump in the Electoral College map. 'The President is an underdog now in his bid for a second term,' wrote Stu Rothenberg, founder of the Rothenberg Political Report, in a column published late last week. 'That doesn't mean he can't win. It simply means that he is in a more difficult place than he was before, in part because Democrats have united behind a consensus candidate who has potentially broad appeal.' \u2014 MORE FROM THE TRAIL \u2014 'Running for office during a pandemic is difficult \u2014 especially for local politicians[105]' via Leigh Giangreco of The Washington Post \u2014 Fending off sickness is nothing new for candidates, some of whom develop their own idiosyncratic strategies for avoiding run-of-the-mill colds and flu. But recently, as schools closed down, employers mandated telework and sporting events were canceled, candidates pursuing every level of elected office have been grappling with the repercussions of losing physical contact with voters. The loss of personal contact may be taking an especially severe toll on local politicians. Presidential campaigns can move their efforts online in a sophisticated way, but those running for local office generally don't have the digital resources that a major party presidential campaign does.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/campaigning-Large.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/campaigning-Large.jpeg</url> Coronavirus is changing retail politics.

Bad news: Florida's unemployment system was set up to hose you[108]' via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Floridians everywhere are losing their jobs right now. Yet when they file for benefits that might help keep a roof over their heads, they run headfirst into a rough reality: Florida's unemployment system was set up to stiff them. Benefits are among the cheapest and shortest-lasting in America, capping out at $275 a week and currently lasting only 12 weeks. They're hard to obtain (the state's application hotline sometimes simply won't accept calls) and tough to keep (thanks to cumbersome requirements). In fact, the benefits are so hard to get and run out so quickly that very few unemployed Floridians \u2014 only one out of every nine \u2014 receive them at any given time. \u2014 OPINIONS \u2014 'Is our fight against coronavirus worse than the disease?[109]' via David L. Katz for The New York Times \u2014 We routinely differentiate between two kinds of military action: the inevitable carnage and collateral damage of diffuse hostilities, and the precision of a 'surgical strike,' methodically targeted to the sources of our particular peril. The latter, when executed well, minimizes resources and unintended consequences alike. As we battle the coronavirus pandemic, and heads of state declare that we are 'at war' with this contagion, the same dichotomy applies. This can be open war, with all the fallout that portends, or it could be something more surgical. The United States and much of the world so far have gone in for the former. I write now with a sense of urgency to make sure we consider the surgical approach. 'Donald Trump barrels toward calamity[110]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post \u2014 If Trump succeeds in getting Americans to mix again in public at the height of the pandemic (many governors are unlikely to be so foolhardy with their constituents' health), he will be risking the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions. Just a week into his tepid embrace of social distancing, he's ready to abandon the fight against the virus and instead force Americans to accept a new strategy for dealing with a pandemic: survival of the fittest. For what? It won't work: The economy won't bounce back if people don't feel safe. 'A plea to Floridians: Follow coronavirus guidelines so we can get our lives back[111]' via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board \u2014 We're pleading with our fellow Floridians during this public health crisis: Just follow the rules. That means going out as little as possible and getting no closer than 6 feet to someone else when you're at the store or even outside getting exercise. Don't hug. Don't shake hands. Keep your hands off surfaces as much as possible. None of this is easy. We aren't wired to avoid contact with others. We are, for the most part, social by nature. In normal times, it's one of our better characteristics. Now, in these abnormal times, we have to change our habits until this crisis passes. 'Shut down Florida, Gov. DeSantis, for at least a few weeks[112]' via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board \u2014 Conceding just a little, the Governor finally directed Floridians over 65 to stay at home. But while they're the most vulnerable, everybody is vulnerable. The blunt truth is that the longer DeSantis postpones stay-at-home for everyone, the worse it will be for everyone. The longer he stalls, the longer young people who believe themselves invincible will pick up and spread the disease. Isolating only their grandparents now, will not protect them later. Every responsible public health physician and epidemiologist is pleading with the public to stay at home and save lives. But it takes a Governor to make such an order effective and enforceable. Sixteen Governors have done what DeSantis refuses to do. 'Gov. DeSantis needs to start acting like an Italian Mayor[113]' via Frank Cerabino of the Palm Beach Post \u2014 DeSantis needs to reconnect with his inner Italian. I know it's in there. All eight of DeSantis' great-grandparents emigrated from Italy. So, buried in his DNA is an Italian's intrinsic talent for telling people off in the most colorful and creative ways \u2014 often involving some appendage choreography. DeSantis needs to let that out. It's time to start loosening his hands and sharpening his tongue. Because we need a governor now who can be a forceful advocate for locking down all of Florida. None of this 14-day, self-quarantine nonsense if you decide to leave New York for Florida. None of this ignorant, dystopian, 'we can't let the cure be worse than the problem' moral bankruptcy. 'Tampa Mayor shows how not to respond to coronavirus[114]' via the Tampa Bay Times editorial board \u2014 Tampa Mayor Jane Castor did exactly the wrong thing by going it alone, unilaterally announcing a stay-at-home order without Hillsborough County and without immediate specifics. Regardless of her good intentions, this erodes the necessary spirit of cooperation with county officials \u2014 not to mention the prospect of regional cooperation in a crisis. Practically speaking, it creates an almost impossible situation for residents, law enforcement and workers as they try to navigate the new normal in Florida's third-largest city. The last thing anyone needs to see now is the Mayor and County Administrator trooping off with their lawyers to the closed courthouse to litigate a turf dispute. 'Greg Newburn: Legislators must call a Special Session to address COVID-19 in Florida's prisons[115]' via Florida Politics \u2014 If you think COVID-19 is daunting now, imagine what it will be like inside Florida's enormous prison system, where social distancing is impossible, quality health care doesn't exist, and hand sanitizer is banned as contraband. Nothing that happens in prison stays in prison for long when it comes to disease \u2014 thousands of corrections staff enter and leave daily, exposing themselves to illness and putting all of us on the outside at greater risk. To save lives, preserve hospital beds, and slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Florida Legislature must call a Special Session and pass measures that allow for the immediate release of the most vulnerable from our prisons. 'Coronavirus pandemic makes politics more relevant, not less[116]' via Randy Schultz for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 We would be in much better shape if the country had a different president and different policies. After Joe Biden won the Florida primary and ran the table on Bernie Sanders, the usual buzz didn't follow. Some commentators wondered whether, in this time of coronavirus upheaval, politics still matter. Actually, politics matter more than ever. Voters make political choices that give people the chance to govern. Only then do we learn whether those political choices were right. The pandemic has shown that Trump was the wrong choice. 'Terrible, horrible thoughts while on a social distance walk[117]' via Stephanie Hayes of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 This is the best weather we've had all year. We will stay 6 feet apart, and all will be well. The Pinellas Trail is, like, 15 feet wide, but the walking side is small, and nobody stays in their lane. Someone is going to shame us. If a woke celebrity tweets my photo, I will die. That woman sneezed into her elbow. Sneezing is not really a symptom. I have seen the meme that explains it. I was sneezing all morning, too, because the houses in this neighborhood are made of pollen and Spanish tile. This is such a sad time. When did we become so wary of each other? When there was a pandemic. 'Because of coronavirus, I'm an FSU senior stuck at home, worried about my future[118]' via Maria Hiers for the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Many students support themselves by working at bars, coffee shops and local businesses. With their bosses increasingly having to make layoffs, our present lives are threatened by financial instability. I was let go from my post-grad job as a photography assistant for performances and productions. My boss said she'd love to be able to work with me, but right now, there's no work.

DeSantis is pondering the President's latest pronouncement \u2014 he wants America back to work by Easter. Also, on today's Sunrise: \u2014 DeSantis is also doubling down on his refusal to order any sort of statewide lockdown.

In fact, the National Guard is now greeting people who arrive in Florida after taking flights from the New York City-area to inform them they have to self-isolate for at least 14 days after arrival. \u2014 State officials are also worried about a cruise ship called Zaandam. The Holland-America liner has at least 42 infected people on board, and they are hoping to dock next week in Broward County, which happens to be the epicenter of Florida's coronavirus epidemic. \u2014 Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried talks about getting calls on coronavirus scams.

'For drive-in theaters, an unexpected revival[122]' via Alyson Krueger of The New York Times \u2014 Drive-in movie theaters may seem like a blast from the past, something out of the 1950s or '60s. Numerous baby boomers haven't gone for decades; Gen Xers and millennials, perhaps never. While most drive-in theaters open for the summer, some of their owners have decided to get an early start this year to provide families an escape insulated by their cars during the pandemic. Spencer Folmar, a filmmaker, believes so strongly that drive-in theaters are not just the past, but the future that he is building what he claims will be the world's largest one in Eustis, with 500 spots, about a 45-minute drive from Orlando.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/driveintheater.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/driveintheater.jpg</url> Are drive-in theaters making a comeback? 'In times of stress and self-distancing, take solace in 'binge baking'[123]' via J. Miller of the Palm Beach Post \u2014 Binge baking isn't a new idea for me. I actually started using the term when we've gone on vacation for the past couple of years. In the weeks before going away, I sit down and figure out what I'm going to cook for family meals. I like to have my grocery list sorted out, bringing what I can from home to avoid waste and to save time at the store when I get to where I'm going. Once that's sorted, I realized that there were things that I wanted to make \u2014 for myself. Somehow that 'me' list kept growing. Until I realized I was binge baking. There was no other way to describe it. But, hey, that's my vacation. 'Wild Florida keeps its drive-thru safari open amid coronavirus shutdowns[124]' via Patrick Connolly of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Normally, Wild Florida also offers airboat tours, a gator park and up-close animal encounters. Those have been temporarily shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic, but the drive-thru safari persists, as it keeps visitors distant from one another in their own cars. Throughout the whole experience, I never left my hatchback. I may have thought about getting out and running when a too-curious emu poked its head inside my open passenger window, perhaps looking for food. But otherwise, I was content to traverse 85 acres of environments from South and North America and the plains of Africa from the comfort of my own air-conditioned vehicle. I happily enjoyed my own tunes while taking in the sights. 'Six-time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady looking forward, not behind[125]' via Fred Goodall of The Associated Press \u2014 'I don't want to talk about the past because that's not relevant to what's important in my future and what's going on this offseason for me,' Brady said during a 32-minute conference call in which he declined to discuss specifics about his decision to leave his old team. The three-time NFL MVP reiterated that while he cherished 'two decades of incredible experience and learning from some of the best players and the best coaches, and the ownership' of the Patriots, he's excited about moving forward with the Bucs, who have a 12-season playoff drought. What Rob Bradley is reading \u2014 'Review: Pearl Jam come roaring back with superb new album[126]' via Mark Kennedy of The Associated Press \u2014 Trust Pearl Jam to still surprise us in 2020. The Seattle rock gods have made an album we didn't know we needed. 'Gigaton' is a fascinating and ambitious 12-track collection with a cleaner, crisper sound that is studded with interesting textures, topped by Eddie Vedder's still-indignant voice. 'Gigaton' marks the band's first coproduction with Josh Evans, who previously worked with Soundgarden and Chris Cornell. He's helped pull out more experimentation, certainly from the messy last studio offering, 'Lightning Bolt.' \u2014 HAPPY BIRTHDAY \u2014 Best wishes to the even-more-incredibly-talented-than-last-yearSara Clementsof Maguire Woods, state Rep.John Cortes,the Port Tampa'sMatt Floyd,and former Sen.Maria Sachs.Belated best wishes tostate Reps.Adam HattersleyandAnthony Rodriguez. ___ Sunburn is authored and assembled byPeter Schorsch,Phil Ammann,A.G.

The CDC found traces of COVID-19 on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship   17 days after passengers had left the cabins. Of note, the cabins had yet to be disinfected. While the data doesn't show if transmission occurred from surfaces, the CDC report recommends exploring that further. The report outlines the responses on board several high-profile cruise ships, including both the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess. Between the ships, there were more than 800 COVID-19 cases that led to 10 deaths.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/princess-cruise.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/princess-cruise.png</url> The Diamond Princess had traces of coronavirus lasting 17 days. 'Florida's budget to take big hit as sales taxes collapse[10]' via Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel   Florida's finances are about to get hit. Hard. That's because some of the industries that have been forced into near-complete shutdowns as part of the effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus are also some of the same industries that Florida leans upon most heavily to prop up the state budget. Restaurants, hotels and admissions   from venues like theme parks, movie theaters and sporting events   account for 20% of state sales tax collections, according to data from the Florida Department of Revenue. And the economic shock from COVID-19 has already radiated far beyond tourism and hospitality businesses. Commercial landlords, the state's fourth-largest source of sales tax receipts, have seen tenants stop paying rent. Tweet, tweet: Why not push to get REC info? In today's @orlandosentinel[11] talks about how state finances are going to get hit hard. We should at a minimum look at sales tax collection data that comes in on April. Amy Baker is even quoted saying they're working on models for pandemics. #FlaPol[12]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/kyG0Sm4Fvz\">https://t.co/kyG0Sm4Fvz</url>[13]   Jimmy Patronis (@JimmyPatronis) March 24, 2020[14]'Betsy DeVos halts collection of defaulted federal student loans[15]' via Michael Stratford of POLITICO   The Education Department is putting a stop to collecting on defaulted federal student loans amid the coronavirus pandemic and ordering private collection firms to stop pursuing borrowers 'until further notice,' according to a memo to the companies. The department plans to make the policy retroactive to March 13, the day Trump declared a national emergency, the official said. The new executive actions provide a reprieve for the more than 9 million federal student loan borrowers who are in default on their debt. The decision to halt the debt collection comes as congressional Democrats, labor unions and consumer advocacy groups urged Education Secretary DeVos to hit pause during the pandemic on the sweeping powers that the federal government has to pursue borrowers.

'We're going to be opening relatively soon,' Trump said. 'I'd love to have it open by Easter It's such an important day for other reasons, but I'll make an important date for this too. I would love to have the country, opened up and just raring to go by Easter.' Asked if it's possible to return to normal by Easter, Trump said: 'I think it's absolutely possible. Now, people are going to have to practice all the social distancing and things we're doing now. But we have to get our country back to work.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Trump-national-emergency.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Trump-national-emergency.jpeg</url> Is Donald Trump hoping for an Easter miracle? Image via AP.; 'The struggle to argue for opening the economy without sounding as if you're OK with more people dying[23]' via Amber Phillips of The Washington Post   Here's a massive messaging problem facing Trump as he indicates he wants to curtail his administration's social-distancing recommendations as soon as next week: How do you argue for reopening the economy when science says doing so will cost lives? Trump's comments have driven to the forefront of a public debate over whether and when to put people back together in public. Those who think we should, and soon, are struggling with how to articulate that in a way that doesn't sound callous. They haven't been successful. The chief example of this is Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is 69, old enough to be in a high-risk category for the virus. He literally said he would be willing to risk his life to go back to work. 'Hopes for united fight against coronavirus recession hurt by nations' go-it-alone style[24]' via David J. Lynch of The Washington Post   The United States and other major governments have made little progress coordinating their spending, trade and tax policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic, instead bowing to nationalist sentiments as a global economic downturn intensifies, according to economists and former government officials. On Tuesday, there was a sign that might be changing with a joint statement by the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven nations that promised 'whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth' and urged all countries to take steps to offset the deepening economic decline. Yet more than three years of Trump's uncompromising 'America First' approach is taking its toll on crisis-fighting efforts. 'Congress, White House close in on $2 trillion stimulus deal to blunt coronavirus fallout[25]' via Erica Werner, Mike DeBonis, Paul Kane and Jeff Stein of The Washington Post   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin   the top White House negotiator   all said they expected resolution imminently. However, lawmakers were still reviewing details, and the situation was fluid and could quickly change. The package would extend extraordinary   and unprecedented   taxpayer assistance to potentially millions of American and foreign companies that have been hammered by the fast-moving economic crisis. It would extend one-time cash payments to most Americans, aimed at flooding the economy with money. The bill is being rushed through Congress without public hearings or formal review, and it's unclear how effective the measures would be in arresting the economy's sudden fall. 'Nancy Pelosi proposal would ban corporations receiving coronavirus aid from lobbying[26]' via Theodoric Meyer of POLITICO   House Democrats drafted the bill, the text of which is circulating on K Street, even as Pelosi also negotiated with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer this weekend on a separate package that McConnell is trying to pass through the upper chamber. A procedural vote to advance the Senate bill failed. While McConnell's bill includes some restrictions on how much companies that receive coronavirus relief loans, Pelosi's proposal goes much further. House Democrats' bill would ban corporations from paying bonuses to their executives or paying any compensation to fired executives until the corporations repay their coronavirus relief loans to the federal government. 'Trump will use Defense Production Act to secure thousands of test kits[27]' via Quint Forgey, Sarah Owermohle and Megan Cassella of POLITICO   FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the Trump administration would formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment sorely needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. 'So, just a little while ago, my team came in, and we're actually going to use the DPA for the first time today,' Gaynor told CNN. The FEMA Administrator said triggering the act would help access 'about 60,000 test kits,' and added that the administration would insert 'DPA language' into the mass contracts for the federal government's order of 500 million personal protective masks. 'Health care workers might get coronavirus shots this fall, vaccine company CEO says[28]' via Arthur Allen of POLITICO   By the fall the FDA would at best have only initial data on the vaccine's safety and its ability to produce antibodies and shape an immune response. The vaccine by then might have been tested in a few hundred people who probably wouldn't have been exposed to the disease.

'Volunteers sew masks for health workers facing shortages[29]' via Tammy Webber, Dee-Ann Durbin and Anne D'Innocenzio of The Associated Press   Scores of people are answering pleas from hospitals, doctors and nurses so desperate for personal protective equipment amid the viral pandemic that they've turned to the public, saying do-it-yourself face masks are better than nothing. And for those sitting at home worrying as the virus strains hospitals and the economy teeters, sewing masks makes them feel less helpless. Deaconess spokeswoman Pam Hight said the hospital system realized it could face a shortage if local infections skyrocket like they have elsewhere. So officials produced and posted a how-to video that has been shared across the country. 'Key medical glove factories cutting staff 50% amid virus[30]' via Juliet Linderman and Martha Mendoza of The Associated Press   Malaysia's medical glove factories, which make most of the world's critical hand protection, are operating at half capacity just when they're most needed. Health care workers snap gloves on as the first line of protection against catching COVID-19 from patients, and they're crucial to protecting patients as well. But medical-grade glove supplies are running low globally, even as more feverish, sweating and coughing patients arrive in hospitals by the day. Malaysia is by far the world's largest medical glove supplier, producing as many as three out of four gloves on the market. The industry has a history of mistreating migrant workers who toil over hand-sized molds as they're dipped in melted latex or rubber, hot and exhausting work. 'Coronavirus in N.Y.: 'Astronomical' surge leads to quarantine warning[31]' via Alan Feuer and Brian M. Rosenthal of The New York Times   Federal and state officials expressed growing alarm on Tuesday about the coronavirus outbreak in New York City, warning that it could reach its peak much sooner than expected and advising people who have passed through or left the city that they should place themselves in a 14-day quarantine. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, indicated that the health authorities were now treating the New York City region as a coronavirus hot zone, akin to areas of China and Europe overwhelmed by the virus. Dr. Birx said that about 60% of all the new cases in the United States were in the New York City metropolitan area, adding that a surge in cases on Long Island showed that people leaving the city were spreading the virus. ''Cacophony of coughing': Inside NYC's virus-besieged ERs[32]' via Michael Sisak, Jim Mustian and Jennifer Peltz of The Associated Press   Faced with an infection rate that is five times that of the rest of the country, health workers are putting themselves at risk to fight a tide of sickness that's getting worse by the day amid a shortage of needed supplies and promises of help from the federal government that have yet to materialize fully. 'You're on 100% of the time   no matter what,' said Dr. Jolion McGreevy, medical director of The Mount Sinai Hospital emergency department. 'It's been a month of full force, and that's certainly very stressful.' Nearly 14,800 people in New York City have been diagnosed with coronavirus as of Tuesday, accounting for more than half the cases in the hardest-hit state in the nation. Um no, they're not   'Texas' Lieutenant Governor suggests grandparents are willing to die for U.S. economy[33]' via Adrianna Rodriguez of USA TODAY   The Lieutenant Governor of Texas argued in an interview on Fox News Monday night that the United States should go back to work, saying grandparents like him don't want to sacrifice the country's economy during the coronavirus crisis. Republican Lt. Gov. Patrick, 69, made the comments on Fox News' 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' after Trump said he wanted to reopen the country for business in weeks, not months. Patrick also said the elderly population, who the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted are more at risk for COVID-19, can take care of themselves and suggested that grandparents wouldn't want to sacrifice their grandchildren's economic future.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PATRICK.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PATRICK.jpg</url>Texas Lt.

'Spring break partier apologizes: 'Don't be arrogant and think you're invincible'[34]' via James Weber of the Cincinnati Enquirer   The Milford High School graduate who gained notoriety last week for indulging in spring-break partying during a pandemic despite warnings against large gatherings has apologized. Brady Sluder said he has realized he's not invincible after all. 'I wasn't aware of the severity of my actions and comments,' Sluder posted in an apology on his Instagram account on March 22. 'I'd like to take this time to own up to the mistakes I've made and apologize to the people I've offended.' Sluder drew attention for a TV interview from Miami. in which he downplayed the seriousness of the new coronavirus pandemic.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html;\">https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html;</url>CORONAFLORIDA   'Ron DeSantis asks Trump to declare Florida major disaster as death toll increases[35]' via Dan DeLuca and Evan Pflugradt of TC Palm   DeSantis sent a letter to Trump formally requesting that he declare a major disaster as Florida responds to COVID-19. The letter requested the inclusion of the following Individual Assistance Programs in the declaration: Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Community Disaster Loans and the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Program. The declaration is submitted as a result of the COVID-19 response for the incident period beginning Jan. 20, for all 67 counties. In addition to the Individual Assistance Programs, the declaration requests additional resources and support from FEMA.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeSantis-3-21-20.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeSantis-3-21-20.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis is asking Donald Trump for a disaster declaration. ''Dumbest s ': DeSantis takes heat as he goes his own way on coronavirus[36]' via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida   While New York, California and other states shutter their economies to keep the coronavirus at bay, DeSantis is refusing to follow the herd. His cure-can't-be-worse-than-the-disease approach has put the Republican Governor under a glaring spotlight locally and nationally as cases of the virus in Florida surge past 1,400. It's a philosophy that aligns DeSantis with other conservatives, including Trump and Florida House Speaker Jos Oliva. 'That is the dumbest s  I have heard in a long time,' said state Sen. Oscar Braynon. 'This is a day-by-day crisis. Italy damn near saw 1,000 people die in one day, and there are people proclaiming we got this, and have it solved in 15 days?' 'Lawmakers continue calls for Governor to issue stay-at-home order[37]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   A group of Senate Democrats is continuing to push DeSantis to close all nonessential businesses and issue a statewide shelter-in-place order amid the COVID-19 virus outbreak. So far, DeSantis has rebuffed those calls, leaving the decision to local governments most impacted by the virus. Sens. Jos Javier Rodrguez and Annette Taddeo   both of whom represent parts of Miami-Dade County   were among the batch of Senators who released statements pushing DeSantis for additional action. 'Strong measures taken now to reduce the rate of transmission will prevent a catastrophic breakdown of our health care system and save lives,' Rodrguez said. 'DeSantis bucking advice of health professionals, local and state lawmakers[38]' via Jeff Schweers of the Tallahassee Democrat   Against the urging of state and local leaders and national health professionals, DeSantis has refused to order a statewide shutdown of all nonessential businesses and mandate that all residents stay at home to help prevent a wider spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. Meantime, the number of Florida cases continues to rise. As of 6 p.m. Tuesday, the number of positive cases rose to 1,467, with 1,379 of those Florida residents and 88 nonresidents. There are now 20 Florida deaths listed. 'You have some people who say this virus is much ado about nothing. I was never in that camp and said it was a serious public health threat,' DeSantis said during a televised news conference. ''Wishy-washy' coronavirus response from DeSantis draws comparisons to Trump[39]' via Steven Lemongello of the Orlando Sentinel   DeSantis appears to be in lockstep with Trump in response to the coronavirus outbreak by refusing to order residents to stay at home and casting blame at Democratic-led states for the crisis   positions that frustrate critics calling for an immediate lockdown of the state. Several cities and counties, including Orange and Leon counties and Tampa, issued stay-at-home orders of their own, without waiting for DeSantis. The response to the outbreak has been largely patchwork from state to state, with DeSantis and other Governors holding back on ordering shutdowns while others, like New York's Andrew Cuomo and Ohio's Mike DeWine, have issued strict shelter-in-place orders. Within Florida, the responses have been what Rep. Sen. Lori Berman called a 'piecemeal approach.' 'Wave of claims swamps Florida's unemployment agency. 'It is impossible to get through'[40]' via Alex Harris and Lawrence Mower of the Miami Herald   Frustrated applicants have flooded social media to report a slew of problems: getting kicked off the website by errors, getting locked out of accounts and failure at reaching a human being on the phone   no matter how often they call. Anthony White, a bartender at the Nautilus Hotel in South Beach, said he sets his alarm every morning so he can call the unemployment office the moment it opens. It's still not early enough. White is one of the tens of thousands turning to the state Department of Economic Opportunity, the agency in charge of Florida's unemployment benefits. Many are finding an agency that's understaffed and unprepared for the onslaught. 'Florida's coronavirus quarantine for New Yorkers: Plane landed. Now what?[41]' via Allison Ross and Douglas R. Clifford   The flight from Newark, New Jersey, landed at Tampa International Airport only 12 minutes after DeSantis' executive order went into effect. Most of the 14 passengers scattered throughout the plane had not yet heard that DeSantis had ordered all travelers like them to self-quarantine for two weeks upon landing. Clutching copies of the three-page executive order provided by a JetBlue crew member, the passengers on JetBlue Flight 905 collected their bags and dispersed across Tampa Bay into the quiet night. It's unclear how, or if, authorities will keep tabs on them. 'Ashley Moody, Nikki Fried warn of scams, price gouging[42]' via the News Service of Florida   Attorney General Moody and Agriculture Commissioner Fried are trying to focus attention on scams and price gouging that stem from the crisis. Scams include text messages claiming to offer victims yet-to-be-approved stimulus package money, crooks going door-to-door in lab coats posing as federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees, and seniors being offered free COVID-19 test kits in exchange for personal information. Also, as of Monday night, Moody's office had received 628 complaints about price gouging related to products such as cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer and face masks. 'Question mark on use of Medicaid for COVID-19 testing[43]' via the News Service of Florida   States have been given authority to extend Medicaid to help pay the costs of COVID-19 testing for uninsured residents under a federal coronavirus relief measure passed last week. But DeSantis avoided directly answering whether Florida would take advantage of the new policy, which would allow the full costs of testing uninsured adults to be borne by the state Medicaid program. DeSantis said Florida would make sure people can get free tests and access to any necessary follow-up care. 'The thing I would say to people about the coronavirus is, if you are somebody who is symptomatic and you go in, you are going to get a free test,' DeSantis said. 'We are going to treat everybody.' 'Advocacy groups release plan to prevent COVID-19 outbreak at correctional facilities[44]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics   'As our country takes measures to protect against coronavirus, we can't afford to forget about the millions of people under the control of our criminal justice system,' said Jessica Jackson, Chief Advocacy Officer at REFORM Alliance. The plan has five prongs and goes by the acronym 'SAFER.' The recommendations: Suspend jail for technical violations; suspend probation office visits and payment of fines; adopt smart alternatives to incarceration; free medical visits and treatment, hand sanitizer, soap, and protective gear; extra precautions for guards and staff; release elderly and vulnerable to home confinement. 'Mike Caruso tests negative for coronavirus after having to miss budget vote[45]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   Rep. Caruso says he tested negative for the COVID-19 virus after feeling ill last week and missing an in-person vote on the state's budget. He eventually decided to get tested at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital (TMH) on March 16. 'I had a fever of 101 when I got to the hospital,' Caruso said. Caruso said the COVID-19 test came back negative on Saturday. But Caruso did test positive for a variant of the flu. Caruso said he's feeling well now, and the symptoms have passed, but he does note his wife is now feeling sick. He described her symptoms like a headache, aches, high temperature and cough. Caruso said he would seek to get her tested for the COVID-19 coronavirus as well if those symptoms don't improve. 'Are we moving about less? Fascinating commercial website tracking us says yes[46]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics  Unacast, a New York-based data crunching consultant, has unveiled its pro bono COVID-19 toolkit with the first tool rating states and counties on whether the GPS data is showing that people, indeed, are going nowhere now. The company has been tracking people[47] by device GPS for years, so it has a baseline of what 'normal' travel behavior is in each county and state. The grades are based on how much that has changed in the past couple of weeks. In many, the changes have been profound, with drop-offs of 30%, 40%, 50% or more in total movement of people with trackable devices. The company's Social Distancing Scoreboard[48], rolled out Tuesday, gives Florida a B grade overall, based on an overall score of a 39% reduction of travel compared with normal.

The coronavirus isn't putting us at risk of a recession. The COVID-19 recession is already here   especially in tourism-centric South Florida. 'There is no question whatsoever that America slipped into a recession in March 2020,' said James Chung, a partner at StratoDem Analytics. 'The big question is how deep it's going to get and where it's going to hurt the most.'

The health department's data list the boy's age as zero, making him the youngest person in the state known to be ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Health officials have also listed the case under 'unknown' for travel-related. DOH did not state whether the baby boy had been in contact with someone who had tested positive for the virus. State health officials have also listed the 2-year-old girl's case under 'unknown' for travel-related and did not indicate whether she had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. 'Miami-Dade orders 10-person limit on all public gatherings except on transit[51]' via Joey Flechas of the Miami Herald   County Mayor Carlos Gimnez issued an order limiting the number of people who gather in public to 10 in an effort to further push residents to practice social distancing and curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Tuesday's order marks another escalation in the local government's efforts to stop people from congregating, urge social distancing and prevent more infections. The order makes an exception for people on public transit vehicles, those waiting at a bus stop, Metromover stop or Metrorail stop, and those traveling in larger vehicles that can fit more than 10. There are also exceptions for government employees and contractors working for the government who are providing services on public streets, alleys and sidewalks. 'More testing is available for COVID-19, but getting results can take days or more[52]' via Daniel Chang of the Miami Herald   Tests can take 24 to 48 hours to turn around once a sample is placed in an analyzing machine, experts say. But the long wait for results can be due to a number of factors, from the growing number of tests being processed during the pandemic to the type of machine that runs the test and whether the test involves a hospitalized patient or a police officer or firefighter, whose test are prioritized. Most of the testing sites operated by the state in partnership with local governments and hospitals are advising people that results can take three to five days, though one hospital official running a private testing site said he has been delivering results in under two days. 'Monroe County to close U.S. 1 to tourists into the Florida Keys due to COVID-19 concerns[53]' via David Goodhue and Gwen Filosa of the Miami Herald   The county decided to place a checkpoint on U.S. 1 at mile marker 112.5 on the 18-mile stretch leading to Florida City on the mainland. There will also be another one on State Road 905, Card Sound Road, which is the other, less-traveled road into the Keys, said Kristen Livengood, the county's spokeswoman. Monroe County Mayor Heather Carruthers said during a news conference that there were no immediate plans to close the road. It's not immediately clear what changed, but Sheriff Rick Ramsay, who said he was not the one to make the decision, said many city leaders in the Keys wanted the highway closed to tourists. 'Opposition mounts against letting ship with 77 sick people dock at Port Everglades[54]' via Lisa J. Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Fearful of the new coronavirus spreading more quickly in South Florida, two Broward County commissioners and a state representative want to stop a ship from docking in Port Everglades. The boat has 77 people showing symptoms, and local leaders worry it would be a health risk to let them disembark. The Holland America cruise ship called Zaandam is hoping to end its voyage at Port Everglades on March 30 after being denied permission to dock in Chile. At an emergency meeting Tuesday, County Commissioner Michael Udine said he wanted the port to turn the ship away. He argues the passengers boarded this ship after the coronavirus was well-known to be an issue. 'They knowingly put themselves at risk,' Udine said. 'Under no circumstances should that ship be at Port Everglades.'

'Meet the Jupiter scientists on the front lines of finding a vaccine[56]' via Sean Howard of the Palm Beach Post   Dozens of scientists at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter are banding together in the global push to develop drugs and vaccines needed to wind down the coronavirus pandemic. At last count, 37 scientists at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, plus another 100 at Scripps facilities in California, are working on coronavirus research, Director of Communications Stacey Singer DeLoye said. Their work largely falls under three categories: research to help develop drugs, vaccines and antibody treatments, said Michael Farzan, a professor who co-chairs Scripps's Department of Immunology and Microbiology. 'We don't know that anything's going to be helpful but everybody's trying to provide some helpful piece on the margins, hoping to pull everyone forward,' said Farzan, who is based in Jupiter. 'Leon County issues 'stay-at-home order,' curfew amid coronavirus pandemic[57]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat   While the Governor has rejected calls for a statewide lockdown, local officials in Tallahassee announced a 'stay-at-home order' Tuesday following the lead of other areas with confirmed cases of coronavirus around the state. Large public gatherings were halted almost two weeks ago as the virus began to spread throughout, and tests slowly began to be administered more readily. Tuesday's stay-at-home order by Leon County Commission Chairman Bryan Desloge and Mayor John Dailey set restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people to go into effect at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Any gathering of more than 10 people would be dispersed by law enforcement and punishable by a fine. A curfew from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. also goes into effect Wednesday. 'Lee County school board to hold first virtual meeting, but does it meet Sunshine Law?[58]' via Pamela McCabe of the Fort Myers News-Press   Keeping in line with directives from the Florida Department of Education and DeSantis, the Lee County school board will meet via a virtual, call-in meeting that will be posted on the school district's YouTube channel. But questions had been raised whether the 1 p.m. meeting is a violation of Sunshine Law. As of 6:30 p.m. Monday, the plan was for the meeting to be recorded and then posted online, but the district has since decided to stream the meeting live on YouTube. At this time, the district is 'not encouraging' people to show up at the board room, housed in the Lee County Public Education Center on Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers. 'Orange County stay-at-home order given, starts Thursday[59]' via Ryan Gillespie and Stephen Hudak of the Orlando Sentinel   The order will take effect at 11 p.m. Thursday and covers all 13 municipalities in the county. It is an attempt to 'flatten the curve'   or ensure that medical facilities aren't overwhelmed as more cases of the virus emerge. Only people traveling for essential business, including trips to work, the grocery store or pharmacy, will be allowed on the streets. The order will be in effect for two weeks, but Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said it could be extended then. Residents are allowed to exercise outside but are discouraged from doing so in groups. 'Welcome to Orlando. You're from New York?

The airport might wind up screening them when they get off the planes, and isolating them in a room for processing. DeSantis, on Monday, ordered that visitors from those three states undergo 14 days of quarantine or self-isolation, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is particularly rampant in those states. 'Orlando airport plunges into silence from coronavirus response[61]' via Kevin Spear of the Orlando Sentinel   At Orlando's airport, the lights are on, the luggage conveyors are chugging along and TSA is on duty, but the place suggests a ship about to sink into the coronavirus storm, with remaining passengers clamoring for life rafts. Traveler counts are down by nearly 80 percent, plunging from nearly 70,000 outbound passengers daily to about 10,000, said airport director Phil Brown. Hundreds are flights are still arriving and departing, but typically with a dozen or 20 people on each plane, Brown said. 'Universal Orlando: Theme parks now staying closed through April 19 due to coronavirus[62]' via Dewayne Bevil and Gabrielle Russon of the Orlando Sentinel   Disney World and SeaWorld Orlando are currently scheduled to remain closed through the end of March.

'West Palm restaurateur makes a passionate plea to city   we need help and fast[63]' via Tony Doris of the Palm Beach Post   Last Friday was the worst day of Rodney Mayo's life thanks to the coronavirus. With state orders to close restaurants except for takeout, the lifelong West Palm Beach resident, whose Subculture Group owns 17 restaurants and bars, laid off 650 employees. By 4 a.m. Saturday, though, he had a plan: to turn his Howley's restaurant at 4700 S Dixie Highway into a production line for free meals for hospitality employees, seniors and others laid off. With a rehired kitchen staff and a small army of volunteers, Mayo's effort provided more than 5,000 meals in its first three days. On Monday, the city commission voted to bolster the effort, pledging $12,000 to keep it going.

'Hillsborough lawmaker hosts blood drive as shortage intensifies[66]' via Mitch Perry of Bay News 9   As concerns about the coronavirus have led to a massive shortage of blood donations in the U.S., a state representative did his part Tuesday to turn the situation around by hosting a blood drive outside his Riverview office. According to The New York Times, as of last week, more than 4,500 of the Red Cross' blood drives have been canceled, resulting in nearly 150,000 fewer donations. OneBlood, another blood donation group, has posted similar dire numbers. That's what led Rep. Adam Hattersley to organize a blood drive event Tuesday. ''More eyes on our community': Lawmen concerned about youth crime during coronavirus threat[67]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat   Law enforcement in Tallahassee is stepping up to make sure its officers are more visible while businesses are all but empty and schools are closed. But it is still too early to tell what effect, if any, a quasi-lockdown will have on capital city crime. The Leon County Sheriff's Office has about 30 more deputies available for patrols from staff that would normally work at schools or in the courthouse.

'The coronavirus recession is here. Will it linger in Florida?[73]' via Richard Danielson and Graham Brink of the Tampa Bay Times   It's not official   not yet, anyway   but economists say the coronavirus recession is here. The private, nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research will make the formal call, probably next year, after looking back on the data. A common rule of thumb is that recessions are characterized by at least two quarters   six months   of falling gross domestic product, though the bureau itself says they're not always defined that way. Some economists have dispensed with the formalities because of how quickly spending has slowed or stopped in major sectors of the economy.

'In Florida, most gig workers can't get unemployment.

Those figures likely include writers, designers and coders but undercount the number of Uber and Lyft drivers, of which there are thousands in the region. Now, as the U.S. and South Florida economies grind to a halt, these workers face extraordinary uncertainty.

It was no match for another nonfiction program: the nightly newscast. As Americans, housebound because of the coronavirus crisis, watch more TV than usual, they have returned to the network news programs that have not been at the center of the national conversation for years. ABCs 'World News Tonight' and the 'NBC Nightly News' had an average of about 12 million viewers for their newscasts last week, among the most significant totals for all network shows, according to Nielsen. That's roughly the same as the average for 'Monday Night Football.' 'Journalism needs a stimulus. Here's what it should look like[82]' via Craig Aaron of Columbia Journalism Review   The coronavirus COVID-19 has upended everything, including business as usual in Washington. In a matter of days, facing the reality of a nationwide shutdown and a worsening economic crisis, Congress got serious about spending money   a lot of it. A recovery package in the trillions of dollars is expected soon. While the most powerful lobbies in Washington are ready with their wish lists, the media and policymakers aren't talking enough about how they could help journalism. The public needs good, economically secure journalists more than ever. To support that work, we need a journalism stimulus now. Free Press is asking for at least $5 billion in emergency funds right away and that Congress put a foundation in place to help sustain journalism over the long term. 'International Baccalaureate, Cambridge cancel spring exams[83]' via Jeffrey S. Solochek of the Tampa Bay Times   Hundreds of students across the Tampa Bay area won't be taking their annual International Baccalaureate or Cambridge International exams this spring as scheduled. The two worldwide programs have canceled the assessments because of coronavirus concerns. It's the first time that IB has called off its tests, many of which students take two years to prepare. If you think the teens are happy about it, you're wrong. N'Dia Webb, a senior at Strawberry Crest High School in eastern Hillsborough County said she and her classmates had studied so hard for the exams, which are the culmination of their IB coursework and help determine whether they qualify for a special diploma. They were ready to knock the tests out of the park. 'Will coronavirus intimacy lead to a baby boom? Or a divorce tsunami?[84]' via Petula Dvorak of The Washington Post   The jokes about intimate, hunker-down time usually fall into heh-heh sex giggles. The sex toy industry is reporting a burst of sales. Condoms and pregnancy tests are almost as scarce as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. 'All this talk of baby booms nine months from now? Maybe,' Lauren Cooper Jerle, who is finding a new rhythm in her Minnesota household as the hubs began working from home: 'I'm wondering if the amount of divorce decrees will be even higher. Reason for divorce: COVID-19.' Jerle's prediction in that March 13 post was followed by similar forecasts from scores of others about the possibility of a huge rise in breakups. COVID-divorce may be bigger than the coronababies. 'Disinfecting wipes to fight coronavirus can clog up pipes and lead to sewage mess[85]' via Adriana Brasileiro of the Miami Herald   Is self-isolation stressing you out? Imagine if your toilet and sewage pipes backed up into the house you're not supposed to leave. That nightmare possibility increases if residents flush all the disinfecting wipes they're suddenly running through to stop the spread of coronavirus, the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department warns. The department is pleading with residents not to flush wipes   bleach wipes, baby wipes, sanitizer wipes, dust wipes and even 'flushable' wipes   but putting them in the trash instead. Those wipes don't break down in wastewater like toilet paper and human waste. They accumulate, mix up with grease, clog the pipes and lead to sewage overflows. 'Pet peeves: Animals react to having their humans on coronavirus lockdown[86]' via Aitor Hernndez-Morales of POLITICO   Think of the poor kitties. With large swaths of Europe on coronavirus lockdown, pets across the Continent are suddenly having to get used to having their human companions around 24 hours a day. While some are responding with puppyish glee, others seem less than thrilled. 'He's visibly unhappy,' said Sara Polo of her Siberian cat Baloo, with whom she shares her Madrid apartment. Before the Spanish government put the country in lockdown, Polo spent most weekdays at work and weekends out of town, meaning her furry friend had the apartment pretty much to himself. 'He can't make sense of why I am here,' she said. 'When I try to work out in the living room, he attacks my yoga mat.'   THE HUMAN TOLL   'Coronavirus adds peril to the already at-risk: 'if I get this stuff, it's going to kill me.'[87]' via Cleve Wootson of The Washington Post   As millions of Americans distance themselves from one another in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the struggle is particularly acute for those whose existing ailments can be fatally exacerbated by the disease   people whose lungs have been compromised by pulmonary disorders, whose immune systems have been suppressed by chemotherapy or whose blood sugar spikes dangerously as their bodies fight even common colds. They have become the most stringent of the social distancers, filling refrigerators and medicine cabinets and hoping that supplies last until the worst is over. Wary of hospital waiting rooms filled with coughing people, when they get sick, they are turning to self-diagnosis and, at times, simply guessing. And they clean. A lot. ''I don't feel safe at all.' As cruise ships sail on, crews fear COVID-19 infection[88]' via Taylor Dolven of the Miami Herald   As the number of people infected on cruise ships continues to climb each day, cruise companies are still downplaying the risk of COVID-19 transmission at sea. 'Cruise ships are not a source for coronavirus,' said Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald in an interview with Axios. 'We have hundreds of cruise ships out there A cruise ship is not a riskier environment.' The CDC has released evidence to the contrary. Approximately 200 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. across 15 states were confirmed to be returned cruise travelers from Feb. 3-March 13. More than 25 cruise ship voyages have had confirmed cases of COVID-19, and at least 10 deaths have been linked to cruise ship travel. 'Handling your kid's disappointment when everything is canceled[89]' via Erinne Magee of The New York Times   Whether they're forced to skip a musical performance, a tryout for a spring sport, a visit to their grandparents or a family vacation, merely telling children that disappointment is a part of life doesn't cut it. In fact, breaking this news may also spark anxiety in parents. So how can parents help kids process their disappointment? I asked a few experts for their advice. First, check your own emotions. When breaking the news of cancellations, parents should focus on validating their children's emotions, whether that is disappointment or fear or something in between, said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, M.D., child and adolescent psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.   ONE GOOD THING   From her Washington, D.C., home, Donna Borak hosts free virtual meditation class daily for anyone who is looking for 'a respite during such a moment of uncertainty.' Borak invites everyone to join in: children, loved ones or pets. 'Even your plants.' As social distancing has become crucial to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, people worldwide are turning to technology to overcome physical barriers. They establish new connections and comforting others overwhelmed by unwelcome news about the virus or burdened by sudden economic hard times.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Borak.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Borak.jpeg</url> In this combination of frame grabs from Donna Borak's online meditation session hosted over Zoom, she leads a group to help ease the stress of isolation from Washington.

So far, participants in her class   held on Zoom video conferencing   have mainly been friends and family. She also shares sessions on Instagram. 'While a meditation class for 15 minutes doesn't solve financial stress or help to explain what will happen next or address serious health care concerns, to me, it's an opportunity not to be alone and to not exist in isolation,' she told The Associated Press. 'I didn't want anyone to feel alone.' 'Going forward, for every time that we opted out at the last minute of attending an event or a happy hour or a dinner, we'll hopefully feel differently about it when we come back together again,' she added.

MATTERS   'Trump agencies steadily push rollbacks as pandemic rages[90]' via Ellen Knickmeyer of The Associated Press   As Americans stockpiled food and medicine and retreated indoors and businesses shuttered in hopes of riding out COVID-19, federal agencies in recent days moved forward on rollbacks that included a widely opposed deregulatory action by the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposed rule would require disclosure of the raw data behind any scientific study used in the rule-making process. That includes confidential medical records that opponents say could be used to identify people. Federal agencies should suspend steps toward enactment for any nonessential rule changes, Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, one of those signing the appeal, said in a separate email. 'Coronavirus is fueling Rick Scott's embrace of government' viaGary Fineoutof POLITICO  Scott came to politics fed up with big government and riding the tea party wave after the financial crisis a decade ago.

'Charlie Crist calls for early release of benefits to support low-income families during coronavirus crisis[92]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   Crist sent a letter to DeSantis asking him to release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits early as low-income and vulnerable Floridians take steps to shelter in place during the coronavirus pandemic. Crist wants SNAP recipients to have access to their April benefits now so they can stock up on enough food to limit necessary trips to the grocery store. 'The Centers for Disease Control has requested that individuals practice social distancing, limiting their contact with others. However, most recipients of SNAP benefits do not have the resources needed to live at home for an extended period, living hand to mouth on monthly payments to purchase the food that they need to feed themselves and their families,' Crist wrote. Awww, that's too bad   'NRA to cut salaries, brace for layoffs as coronavirus disrupts fundraising, internal memo states[93]' via Beth Reinhard of The Washington Post   More than 800 people worked at the NRA in 2018, according to its latest tax filing. However, that number includes part-time workers who would not be affected by the reductions. Schedules for hourly workers will be reduced from five to four days a week, the memo said. Some top NRA officials, including chief executive Wayne LaPierre, are taking salary reductions greater than 20%. In 2018, compensation for top officials, including LaPierre, surged by 41% and legal fees more than tripled even as the organization sharply reduced spending on programs central to its mission. LaPierre received a total of about $2.2 million from the NRA and related entities in 2018, including a base salary of $1.27 million.

Supporters of the group 1000 Friends of Florida are being encouraged to tell DeSantis to nix a bill (SB 410) that would change how most county governments manage growth. A coalition of voting-rights groups called on DeSantis to reject a measure (SB 1794) that would impose a series of new restrictions on ballot initiatives.

Environmentalists want Governor to veto water bill   On Tuesday, dozens of environmental groups banded together to urge DeSantis to veto his priority bill setting new water quality regulations in the state, Bruce Ritchie of POLITICO Florida reports. The groups say the bill, which directs local governments to draft plans for septic tanks and sewage treatment plants, doesn't make meaningful regulatory changes 'Florida's waters are polluted because our regulatory system is broken and those in charge of protecting our waters are unduly influenced by polluters and their lobbyists,' the groups wrote in a letter. Conversely, the Governor has lauded the plan, a strong indication he will sign the legislation into law. 'Ashley Moody issue subpoenas for price gouging[95]' via the News Service of Florida   Moody said she issued more than 40 subpoenas because of alleged price gouging on 'essential commodities' through accounts on Amazon. The subpoenas, which went to third-party sellers who use Amazon, involve allegations of excessive prices on items such as face masks, hand sanitizers and disinfectants during a state of emergency declared because of the coronavirus. 'Floridians are searching for essential products needed to stay safe and healthy during this COVID-19 pandemic,' Moody said in a prepared statement. 'Sadly, when they find these products for sale online, they often discover that the price tag makes them unattainable. This is unacceptable and unlawful.' 'If Florida shuts down, will medical marijuana dispensaries stay open?[96]' via Samantha J. Gross of the Miami Herald   As municipalities like Miami-Dade and Broward counties have started to close nonessential businesses in an attempt to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, they have exempted what are deemed 'essential' businesses like health care providers, gas stations, banks and news outlets. But what about medical marijuana treatment centers? They'll remain open for business. According to statute, the dispensaries are considered an essential service and are to be treated like retail pharmacies. Many of the dispensaries use delivery services to get medication to patients, as well as offer drive-thru windows or online ordering and pick up at the stores. 'Receiver opposed in domestic violence coalition case[97]' via Dara Kam of the News Service of Florida   A nonprofit foundation supporting the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence is asking a circuit judge to reverse a recent decision that put the embattled agency under the control of a receiver. The decision by Leon County Circuit Judge Ronald Flury, at the request of Attorney General Ashley Moody, came amid investigations into allegedly exorbitant executive compensation paid to Tiffany Carr, the former CEO of the coalition and the head of the foundation. Moody early this month filed an emergency motion asking Flury to put the coalition and its fundraising arm, the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence Foundation, in the hands of a receiver and to preserve the assets of both organizations. 'Jury trials to remain suspended through mid-April[98]' via the News Service of Florida   As the novel coronavirus continues to spread throughout the state, Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Canady has extended the suspension of jury trials and other in-person court proceedings through April 17. Canady's order extends deadlines in previous administrative orders aimed at complying with health officials' recommendations to curb COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. In a video message, Canady addressed the impact of COVID-19 on the state's justice system. 'We are all facing an unprecedented challenge. The pandemic is now affecting everyone. We are living our lives in a way that none of us would have contemplated a few short weeks ago,' the chief justice said. 'New UCF president could get $600K annual pay[99]' via Annie Martin of the Orlando Sentinel   Incoming UCF President Alexander Cartwright could be entitled to an annual salary of $600,000   20% higher than his predecessor's pay   according to a proposed five-year contract up for university trustees' approval on Tuesday morning. The University of Central Florida trustees tapped Cartwright to serve as the school's next president last Friday, selecting him unanimously over one other finalist. They're slated to vote on a contract for Cartwright with a proposed salary of nearly 20% more than what he earns in his current role as chancellor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Cartwright's contract with UCF would start on April 13. His appointment is subject to approval from the Board of Governors. 'Another area code eyed for Tampa area[100]' via Jim Turner of the News Service of Florida   The North American Numbering Plan Administrator, which oversees telephone numbering across the U.S. and other countries, has proposed creating what is known as an 'all-services overlay' as numbers in the 813 area code   all of Hillsborough County, Oldsmar in Pinellas County and parts of Pasco County   are forecast to be exhausted during the third quarter of 2022. Under the plan, which the Florida Public Service Commission will consider, a new area code would be added   or overlaid   in the same area. Current customers would keep the 813 area code and their numbers, but new customers and additional lines would receive the new area code. Also, all local calls in the area would require 10-digit dialing.

Few are willing to predict with any certainty how the events of the last few weeks will affect what is still expected to be a close election in November.

'Two political handicappers say the Electoral College map now leans toward Democrats[104]' via Chris Cillizza of CNN   In the past five days, two of the most prominent nonpartisan political analysts in the country have released new projections that show presumptive Democratic nominee Biden with a clear edge over Trump in the Electoral College map. 'The President is an underdog now in his bid for a second term,' wrote Stu Rothenberg, founder of the Rothenberg Political Report, in a column published late last week. 'That doesn't mean he can't win. It simply means that he is in a more difficult place than he was before, in part because Democrats have united behind a consensus candidate who has potentially broad appeal.'   MORE FROM THE TRAIL   'Running for office during a pandemic is difficult   especially for local politicians[105]' via Leigh Giangreco of The Washington Post   Fending off sickness is nothing new for candidates, some of whom develop their own idiosyncratic strategies for avoiding run-of-the-mill colds and flu. But recently, as schools closed down, employers mandated telework and sporting events were canceled, candidates pursuing every level of elected office have been grappling with the repercussions of losing physical contact with voters. The loss of personal contact may be taking an especially severe toll on local politicians. Presidential campaigns can move their efforts online in a sophisticated way, but those running for local office generally don't have the digital resources that a major party presidential campaign does.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/campaigning-Large.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/campaigning-Large.jpeg</url> Coronavirus is changing retail politics.

Bad news: Florida's unemployment system was set up to hose you[108]' via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel   Floridians everywhere are losing their jobs right now. Yet when they file for benefits that might help keep a roof over their heads, they run headfirst into a rough reality: Florida's unemployment system was set up to stiff them. Benefits are among the cheapest and shortest-lasting in America, capping out at $275 a week and currently lasting only 12 weeks. They're hard to obtain (the state's application hotline sometimes simply won't accept calls) and tough to keep (thanks to cumbersome requirements). In fact, the benefits are so hard to get and run out so quickly that very few unemployed Floridians   only one out of every nine   receive them at any given time.   OPINIONS   'Is our fight against coronavirus worse than the disease?[109]' via David L. Katz for The New York Times   We routinely differentiate between two kinds of military action: the inevitable carnage and collateral damage of diffuse hostilities, and the precision of a 'surgical strike,' methodically targeted to the sources of our particular peril. The latter, when executed well, minimizes resources and unintended consequences alike. As we battle the coronavirus pandemic, and heads of state declare that we are 'at war' with this contagion, the same dichotomy applies. This can be open war, with all the fallout that portends, or it could be something more surgical. The United States and much of the world so far have gone in for the former. I write now with a sense of urgency to make sure we consider the surgical approach. 'Donald Trump barrels toward calamity[110]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post   If Trump succeeds in getting Americans to mix again in public at the height of the pandemic (many governors are unlikely to be so foolhardy with their constituents' health), he will be risking the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions. Just a week into his tepid embrace of social distancing, he's ready to abandon the fight against the virus and instead force Americans to accept a new strategy for dealing with a pandemic: survival of the fittest. For what? It won't work: The economy won't bounce back if people don't feel safe. 'A plea to Floridians: Follow coronavirus guidelines so we can get our lives back[111]' via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board   We're pleading with our fellow Floridians during this public health crisis: Just follow the rules. That means going out as little as possible and getting no closer than 6 feet to someone else when you're at the store or even outside getting exercise. Don't hug. Don't shake hands. Keep your hands off surfaces as much as possible. None of this is easy. We aren't wired to avoid contact with others. We are, for the most part, social by nature. In normal times, it's one of our better characteristics. Now, in these abnormal times, we have to change our habits until this crisis passes. 'Shut down Florida, Gov. DeSantis, for at least a few weeks[112]' via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board   Conceding just a little, the Governor finally directed Floridians over 65 to stay at home. But while they're the most vulnerable, everybody is vulnerable. The blunt truth is that the longer DeSantis postpones stay-at-home for everyone, the worse it will be for everyone. The longer he stalls, the longer young people who believe themselves invincible will pick up and spread the disease. Isolating only their grandparents now, will not protect them later. Every responsible public health physician and epidemiologist is pleading with the public to stay at home and save lives. But it takes a Governor to make such an order effective and enforceable. Sixteen Governors have done what DeSantis refuses to do. 'Gov. DeSantis needs to start acting like an Italian Mayor[113]' via Frank Cerabino of the Palm Beach Post   DeSantis needs to reconnect with his inner Italian. I know it's in there. All eight of DeSantis' great-grandparents emigrated from Italy. So, buried in his DNA is an Italian's intrinsic talent for telling people off in the most colorful and creative ways   often involving some appendage choreography. DeSantis needs to let that out. It's time to start loosening his hands and sharpening his tongue. Because we need a governor now who can be a forceful advocate for locking down all of Florida. None of this 14-day, self-quarantine nonsense if you decide to leave New York for Florida. None of this ignorant, dystopian, 'we can't let the cure be worse than the problem' moral bankruptcy. 'Tampa Mayor shows how not to respond to coronavirus[114]' via the Tampa Bay Times editorial board   Tampa Mayor Jane Castor did exactly the wrong thing by going it alone, unilaterally announcing a stay-at-home order without Hillsborough County and without immediate specifics. Regardless of her good intentions, this erodes the necessary spirit of cooperation with county officials   not to mention the prospect of regional cooperation in a crisis. Practically speaking, it creates an almost impossible situation for residents, law enforcement and workers as they try to navigate the new normal in Florida's third-largest city. The last thing anyone needs to see now is the Mayor and County Administrator trooping off with their lawyers to the closed courthouse to litigate a turf dispute. 'Greg Newburn: Legislators must call a Special Session to address COVID-19 in Florida's prisons[115]' via Florida Politics   If you think COVID-19 is daunting now, imagine what it will be like inside Florida's enormous prison system, where social distancing is impossible, quality health care doesn't exist, and hand sanitizer is banned as contraband. Nothing that happens in prison stays in prison for long when it comes to disease   thousands of corrections staff enter and leave daily, exposing themselves to illness and putting all of us on the outside at greater risk. To save lives, preserve hospital beds, and slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Florida Legislature must call a Special Session and pass measures that allow for the immediate release of the most vulnerable from our prisons. 'Coronavirus pandemic makes politics more relevant, not less[116]' via Randy Schultz for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   We would be in much better shape if the country had a different president and different policies. After Joe Biden won the Florida primary and ran the table on Bernie Sanders, the usual buzz didn't follow. Some commentators wondered whether, in this time of coronavirus upheaval, politics still matter. Actually, politics matter more than ever. Voters make political choices that give people the chance to govern. Only then do we learn whether those political choices were right. The pandemic has shown that Trump was the wrong choice. 'Terrible, horrible thoughts while on a social distance walk[117]' via Stephanie Hayes of the Tampa Bay Times   This is the best weather we've had all year. We will stay 6 feet apart, and all will be well. The Pinellas Trail is, like, 15 feet wide, but the walking side is small, and nobody stays in their lane. Someone is going to shame us. If a woke celebrity tweets my photo, I will die. That woman sneezed into her elbow. Sneezing is not really a symptom. I have seen the meme that explains it. I was sneezing all morning, too, because the houses in this neighborhood are made of pollen and Spanish tile. This is such a sad time. When did we become so wary of each other? When there was a pandemic. 'Because of coronavirus, I'm an FSU senior stuck at home, worried about my future[118]' via Maria Hiers for the Tampa Bay Times   Many students support themselves by working at bars, coffee shops and local businesses. With their bosses increasingly having to make layoffs, our present lives are threatened by financial instability. I was let go from my post-grad job as a photography assistant for performances and productions. My boss said she'd love to be able to work with me, but right now, there's no work. Provide opportunities for graduates and find yourself surprised that Generation Z's lazy reputation is often undeserved. Thousands of us would fetch a bone for a dollar or forfeit our last roll of toilet paper to make rent.  TODAY'S SUNRISE   Gov. DeSantis is pondering the President's latest pronouncement   he wants America back to work by Easter. Also, on today's Sunrise:   DeSantis is also doubling down on his refusal to order any sort of statewide lockdown. He says people in New York and California have already demonstrated that it doesn't work that well. In fact, the National Guard is now greeting people who arrive in Florida after taking flights from the New York City-area to inform them they have to self-isolate for at least 14 days after arrival.   State officials are also worried about a cruise ship called Zaandam. The Holland-America liner has at least 42 infected people on board, and they are hoping to dock next week in Broward County, which happens to be the epicenter of Florida's coronavirus epidemic.   Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried talks about getting calls on coronavirus scams. Fried offers a few hints on how to protect yourself from fraudsters. She was also the first official in Florida to call for a statewide lockdown, so she gives her reaction to the Governor's rejection of that advice. And two Florida women prove that the title 'Florida Man' knows no gender.

'For drive-in theaters, an unexpected revival[122]' via Alyson Krueger of The New York Times   Drive-in movie theaters may seem like a blast from the past, something out of the 1950s or '60s. Numerous baby boomers haven't gone for decades; Gen Xers and millennials, perhaps never. While most drive-in theaters open for the summer, some of their owners have decided to get an early start this year to provide families an escape insulated by their cars during the pandemic. Spencer Folmar, a filmmaker, believes so strongly that drive-in theaters are not just the past, but the future that he is building what he claims will be the world's largest one in Eustis, with 500 spots, about a 45-minute drive from Orlando.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/driveintheater.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/driveintheater.jpg</url> Are drive-in theaters making a comeback? 'In times of stress and self-distancing, take solace in 'binge baking'[123]' via J. Miller of the Palm Beach Post   Binge baking isn't a new idea for me. I actually started using the term when we've gone on vacation for the past couple of years. In the weeks before going away, I sit down and figure out what I'm going to cook for family meals. I like to have my grocery list sorted out, bringing what I can from home to avoid waste and to save time at the store when I get to where I'm going. Once that's sorted, I realized that there were things that I wanted to make   for myself. Somehow that 'me' list kept growing. Until I realized I was binge baking. There was no other way to describe it. But, hey, that's my vacation. 'Wild Florida keeps its drive-thru safari open amid coronavirus shutdowns[124]' via Patrick Connolly of the Orlando Sentinel   Normally, Wild Florida also offers airboat tours, a gator park and up-close animal encounters. Those have been temporarily shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic, but the drive-thru safari persists, as it keeps visitors distant from one another in their own cars. Throughout the whole experience, I never left my hatchback. I may have thought about getting out and running when a too-curious emu poked its head inside my open passenger window, perhaps looking for food. But otherwise, I was content to traverse 85 acres of environments from South and North America and the plains of Africa from the comfort of my own air-conditioned vehicle. I happily enjoyed my own tunes while taking in the sights. 'Six-time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady looking forward, not behind[125]' via Fred Goodall of The Associated Press   'I don't want to talk about the past because that's not relevant to what's important in my future and what's going on this offseason for me,' Brady said during a 32-minute conference call in which he declined to discuss specifics about his decision to leave his old team. The three-time NFL MVP reiterated that while he cherished 'two decades of incredible experience and learning from some of the best players and the best coaches, and the ownership' of the Patriots, he's excited about moving forward with the Bucs, who have a 12-season playoff drought. What Rob Bradley is reading   'Review: Pearl Jam come roaring back with superb new album[126]' via Mark Kennedy of The Associated Press   Trust Pearl Jam to still surprise us in 2020. The Seattle rock gods have made an album we didn't know we needed. 'Gigaton' is a fascinating and ambitious 12-track collection with a cleaner, crisper sound that is studded with interesting textures, topped by Eddie Vedder's still-indignant voice. 'Gigaton' marks the band's first coproduction with Josh Evans, who previously worked with Soundgarden and Chris Cornell. He's helped pull out more experimentation, certainly from the messy last studio offering, 'Lightning Bolt.'

In addition to it being Seersucker Day, there's all this and then some: Taking a stand against pre-emption \u2014 A diverse group of Florida organizations will stand together in front of the House of Representatives Chamber doors Wednesday morning to 'urge legislators to oppose policies that would remove local ability to pass laws stronger than the state's own laws.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/seersuckersuit.jpg;While\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/seersuckersuit.jpg;While</url> it may be Seersucker Day at The Capitol, many serious issues still need addressing this Session.The group includes the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Lung Association, Equality Florida, Florida Association of Counties, Florida Council of Churches, Florida Immigrant Coalition, Organize Florida and Surfrider Foundation Speakers include Democratic state Rep. Nick Duran of Miami, Leon County Commissioner and President-Elect for the Florida Association of Counties Nick Maddox, Florida Government Relations Director for the American Heart Association Mark Landreth, Organize Florida and Florida Immigrant Coalition spokeswoman Ida Eskamani, and Matt Jordan, Florida Government Relations Director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. They will stand against the 'state overreach' found in more than 35 bills this session \u2014 pre-emption policies that 'block local governments from doing more to protect the well-being of their communities.' 'Pre-emption is when a higher form of government, such as a state legislature, limits a lower form of government, such as a county or city council, from acting on an issue,' the release said. 'It is becoming an increasingly common state legislative tactic and extending to a greater number of issue areas. During the 2019 Legislative Session, according to the Florida League of Cities, more than 35 pre-emption bills are being considered that block local communities from responding to the needs of their citizens.' That's at 10 a.m., in Room 333 of The Capitol. \u2014 Michael's Angels will rally in Tally \u2014 We wanted to share this 'very personal' letter we received from Kristen McDonald of Hill+Knowlton Strategies in Tallahassee. Please read: 'For those of you who don't know, I was born and raised in Panama City. My family still lives there, and my childhood home was destroyed when Hurricane Michael hit six months ago (amazingly the only room left intact was the one my dad was hunkered down in with our two dogs and cat!). 'Recovery efforts in the area have been slow thus far, and many of you have covered the numerous pleas for federal and state funding to assist with those efforts. 'On Wednesday, April 17, affected residents from my hometown and the surrounding areas are traveling to Tallahassee for a 'Rally in Tally' event in the Capitol Courtyard at 10 a.m. where they will urge lawmakers to support disaster relief for the Panhandle. 'The event has been organized by the group Michael's Angels I've been told several buses have been chartered and that hundreds of people are expected to attend. Local radio personality Dr. Shane Collins of 92.5 WPAP-FM will also be broadcasting live from the bus and throughout the day. 'I know you are all so busy with Session, but this is an important issue that needs continued attention. I hope you can join this group in the Capitol Courtyard at 10 a.m. to hear their compelling stories firsthand.' \u2014 Coalition for Silver Solutions continues fight for funding \u2014 Advocates for Florida's senior population will be at the Capitol as the Coalition works to retain funding for nursing home and community care. AARP, the Florida Health Care Association, and LeadingAge Florida recently formed the coalition to help develop strategies to meet the short- and long-term health care needs of Florida's aging population. Their immediate concerns are retaining a $138 million boost in nursing home Medicaid funding provided by the Legislature in 2018 that is in jeopardy this year, along with the need to fund home and community-based services to reduce the current waitlist. 'Members of the three organizations will work the halls of the Capitol to remind lawmakers that quality care for elders is directly connected to adequate funding,' a news release said. \u2014 Also on the Capitol events calendar \u2014 Project Citizen, a program of The Florida Law Related Education Association that addresses public policy concerns, will display student projects in the Rotunda. Also: \u2014 Anglers for Lake O will be in Waller Park (next to the dolphins' fountain) starting at 10 a.m. to promote 'public awareness of water projects that will #SlowTheFlow of water coming into Lake Okeechobee.' \u2014 It's Rural Counties Day. Starting at 10 a.m., Baker, Bradford, Putnam, Union counties and the City of Keystone Heights will 'create a forum for citizens, elected officials, and business professionals to work together to highlight our business-friendly environment, and represent rural counties' specific legislative needs.' \u2014 The Oviedo-Winter Springs Chamber of Commerce meets at 1:30 p.m. on the 22nd floor 'to meet with Legislators and discuss the Legislative Session.' \u2014 The Florida Technology Council, the statewide tech association, hosts its annual event on the 22nd floor at 2 p.m. \u2014 Please consider stopping by \u2014 I have been invited to be the featured speaker at the next meeting of Capital Tiger Bay Club. That's next Tuesday, 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m., at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center in Tallahassee. The main topic of this special program will be 'A Florida nightmare: Voters without a voice[1],' a recent op-ed where I focused on HJR 57, a proposal that would dramatically change the way Floridians can amend our state Constitution. While HJR 57 may not get much play with the general populace, HRJ 57 has solicited some strong feelings among those in The Process.

'Let's hope we get a little bit of a break this hurricane season.'

The Keys received federal funds to remove debris from 172 of the county's 500 canals but sediment removal is still needed from additional canals, county officials say.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UF-2.jpeg;;Ron\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UF-2.jpeg;;Ron</url> DeSantis visits the University of Florida to participate in a roundtable discussion in Gainesville outlining his environmental priorities regarding $625 million for Everglades restoration, the appointment of a Chief Science Officer, and a strategic plan to combat blue-green algae and red tide.'DeSantis: Restore accountability to Florida Virtual School[8]' via Beth Kassab and Lesley Postal of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014DeSantissupports a call from Education CommissionerRichard Corcoranfor the Legislature to commission a new audit of the public online school that received more than $180 million in taxpayer money last year, said his spokeswomanHelen Ferre. DeSantis also plans to appoint new members to the school's seven-member board, which has three empty seats and two others filled by people who said they would leave once replacements are named. 'He is reviewing all options to address the situation at Florida Virtual School with the intent to restore transparency and accountability to the organization,' Ferre said.

'Report: 8 nurseries shortlisted for new medical marijuana licenses[11]' \u2014 A total of eight new nurseries may be permitted to grow and sell medical marijuana under a new agreement being worked out by state officials. That's according to a report from POLITICO Florida's Arek Sarkissian. Sarkissian cites 'a person close to the talks,' detailing the eight companies now on a short list drafted by Gov. DeSantis. Those companies are Bill's Nursery, DeLeon's Bromeliads, Dewar Nurseries, Hart's Plant Nursery, Perkins Nursery, Redland Nursery, Spring Oaks Greenhouse and Tree King Tree Farm. Since the inception of the state's medical marijuana program in 2014, growers have complained about the limited number of licenses available. Some of those concerns have developed into lawsuits. 'Nikki Fried: Symbolic solutions to fictional problems[12]' via Florida Politics \u2014 I've also learned that over 54 percent of Florida's immigrants work in farming, fishing or forestry. They make up more than 45 percent of the workforce in those industries. And targeting immigrants would create lasting damage to businesses and industries throughout our state's economy.

Meanwhile, a business-backed taxoverhaulhad an easier time advancing in the Senate, with the proposal including a move to collect sales taxes on purchases Floridians make from many out-of-state online retailers. In a party-line, 18-9 vote, the House Appropriations Committee approved the House package (HB 7123), which includes sales-tax 'holidays' for storm preparation and back-to-school shopping and a reduction in a commercial lease tax. The bill has cleared its committees and can be taken up on the House floor. 'Senate bill to make internet marketplaces all pay sales taxes passes panel[15]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 A Senate bill that would require all significant internet dealers and marketplaces to collect and remit sales taxes to Florida regardless of whether they have physical presences in the Sunshine State won approval Tuesday from the Senate Finance and Tax Committee. Senate Bill 1112 from Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters of Sarasota would put the responsibility for sales taxes on any internet dealers and marketplaces that have at least 200 annual product sales or $100,000 in annual business in Florida. 'Lawmakers moving aid bills for Hurricane Michael[16]' via Curt Anderson ofThe Associated Press\u2014 A Senate Appropriations panel approved a pair of bills to assist with housing, debris removal, infrastructure repairs, and other needs. One measure would create a $300 million loan program out of the 'rainy day' reserve fund if lawmakers ultimately decide to approve the money in final budget negotiations. Democratic Sen.Bill Montford, who represents many of the most affected counties, said northwest Florida is still suffering months after Category 4 Hurricane Michael swept ashore in October. Congress has been unable to agree on a roughly $13 billion aid package for multiple U.S. disasters including Michael \u2014 meaning state legislators must step in, Montford said. 'Plan could help hurricane-hampered colleges[17]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida \u2014 School officials say Gulf Coast State College in Panama City lost 841 students during the spring 2019 semester. That's a 15 percent drop in enrollment, compared to the same time last year. That led Sen.George Gainerto propose a bill that would allow hurricane-impacted state colleges to waive out-of-state tuition fees when they see enrollment drop by more than 10 percent as a result of storms. The proposal (SB 1164) passed unanimously and needs to clear the Senate Appropriations Committee before it can go to the Senate floor. The House version (HB 593), sponsored by Rep.Jay Trumbull, has been approved by committees and is ready to be heard by the full House. 'School referendum funding bill heads to House floor with some changes[18]' via Emily Mahoney of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Under this bill, House Bill 7123, districts whose voters approved a higher property tax rate for school funding would need to share that money with charter schools starting in the next budget year. Charter schools are paid for with public funds and run by private entities. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Bryan Avila, added an amendment in the House Appropriations Committee which would require charter schools that receive a slice of these funds to use them for the intended purpose of the referendums. The amendment also removed the financial penalty for school districts should they fail to share the funds with districts properly.

That change blocks USF from instead creating regional campuses some faculty and administration worried would diminish the smaller schools' autonomy. The USF consolidation task force recommended protecting campuses as branches. The amendment would also protect the entire USF system's funding by blocking the Florida Board of Governors from using consolidated data at the three campuses 'for purposes of determining eligibility for funding.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sprowls.jpgSafeguards:\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sprowls.jpgSafeguards:</url> Chris Sprowls filed an amendment that would ensure the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee campuses were designated 'branch campuses,' that would offer some independence in consolidation.''Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act' clears final House panel[20]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 A bill to ensure women inmates receive necessary hygiene products cleared its final House panel Tuesday, as the House Judiciary Committee signed off on the bill. The legislation (HB 49), also known as the 'Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act,' was sponsored by Democratic Reps. Shevrin Jones of West Park and Amy Mercado of Orlando. The measure would mandate those feminine hygiene products, toothbrushes, and toilet paper are at no cost.

'Contraceptives pilot program gets Senate OK[21]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 A Senatehealth carepanel approved a bill that would lead to establishing a pilot program that would allow women in three Florida counties to access long-acting reversible contraceptives such as intrauterine devices. Before approving the bill (SB 410), the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee removed $100,000 that would have gone to the state Department of Health for the program. It made the program subject to a legislative appropriation. The bill, sponsored by Sen.Lori Berman, would require the health department to contract with family planning providers in Duval, Hillsborough and Palm Beach counties to make long-acting contraceptives available to women seeking family planning services. 'Lawmakers carry out death benefits measure[22]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 A Senate panel approved a proposal that would set death benefits that would be paid if law-enforcement officers, firefighters, other first responders and military members are killed while on duty. The proposal (SB 7098), sponsored by Sen.Ed Hooperwould carry out a constitutional amendment, known as Amendment 7, passed in November. The bill, in part, addresses law-enforcement officers, correctional officers, correctional probation officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, paramedics and Florida National Guard members. They would be entitled to $75,000 in death benefits if they accidentally die in the course of their duties and $225,000 if they are intentionally or illegally killed, such as if a law-enforcement officer is ambushed, Hooper said. 'Bill cracking down on cosmetic surgery clinics ready for House floor[23]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 A bill aimed at cutting down on the danger of rogue plastic surgery centers cleared its final House committee Tuesday after it was OK'd by the Health and Human Services Committee. Rep. Anthony Rodriguez filed the legislation (HB 933). The measure requires clinics to register with the Department of Health (DOH). The legislation then allows for DOH to bar doctors from opening a new clinic for up to five years if their previous clinic is shut down for violations. A strike-all amendment detailed by Rodriguez Tuesday 'requires offices where physicians perform certain surgeries to designate a physician who is responsible for ensuring the office complies with safety requirements.' 'More civil lawsuits could be headed to county courts[24]' via Florida Politics \u2014 On Tuesday, the Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Subcommittee moved a bill that would shunt more civil lawsuits to county courts. The bill (SB 328) will move to the full Appropriations Committee on Thursday. At present, there is a $15,000 limit on damages in civil suits, also called 'small claims,' filed on the county level. This bill, as amended in committee, would raise that to $30,000 on Jan. 1, 2020, and to $50,000 by Jan. 1, 2022. The current cap hasn't been changed since 1992.\u2014 MORE SESSION \u2014 'Senator wants Attorney General Moody's opinion on Amendment 4[25]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 In a letter sent last week, Democratic Sen.Jason PizzoaskedMoodyto answer the question at the heart of the debate: Do felons have to pay off all fines, fees and restitution before being allowed to vote? 'This matter is objectively of great public importance, and your opinion would go a long way to lend definition and certainty to critical questions driving conversations statewide,' Pizzo wrote. 'There are vast emotional, liberty and financial risks at stake in this matter, and should you accept this request, you would do so with the appreciation of most Floridians, including myself.'

But what else does it do?[26]' via Skyler Swisher of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The heated debate over arming teachers is overshadowing other parts of the bill. The proposal (SB 7030) includes changes that are getting broader support. Each school board and charter school governing board would be required to adopt an active assailant plan by Oct. 1 and conduct annual training. A standardized threat assessment process, used to evaluate the risk posed by a student, must be developed by Aug. 1 for use by public schools. Student records would be required to be transferred within one school day for students transferring to another school in the district. The Department of Education could withhold salaries for school board members and superintendents if they don't comply with state reporting requirements. 'Florida closer to ban on 'sanctuary cities' as Trump talks of sending migrants to them[27]' via Samantha Gross of the Miami Herald \u2014Trump's stance on sanctuary cities has also become a key issue for Republicans in Florida, as twin proposals to ban the jurisdictions in Florida make their way to the chamber floors. The bills \u2014 SB 168 and HB 527 \u2014 are being heard in committee for the last time this week, and have garnered support from Republican members, leadership andDeSantis.

First on #FlaPol \u2014'Hedge your bets: Legal opinion threatens to sink gambling bill[28]' via Jim Rosica of Florida Politics \u2014 The lead backer of last year's successful 'voter control of gambling' constitutional amendment has told top lawmakers they can't put forth a gambling bill with new games this year \u2014 because they first must get voter approval. In a letter, John Sowinski \u2014 president of Voters in Charge, the political committee behind the amendment \u2014 shared a legal opinion from lawyer Paul Hawkes, a former lawmaker and appellate judge and now a lobbyist for the greyhound industry. Hawkes said that under Amendment 3, lawmakers could not authorize sports betting or designated player games or allow slot machines permit-holders to move their slots to another location. Instead, a majority of voters has to say 'yes.' Democrats chide Ralph Massullo for racial comments \u2014 When the House voted on a bill to block insurers from using DNA info for actuarial decisions, GOP Rep. Ralph Massullo said it would prevent discrimination against African Americans and Jews, who 'have a long list of predisposed genetic diseases.' Senate Democrats interpreted those comments as racist, reports Alexandra Glorioso of POLITICO Florida. 'Your assertion that the use of DNA evidence, when it is part of an insurance applicant's medical record, would lead to an increase in racial and religious discrimination is not only already against the law, it is incorrect,' Sens. Kevin Rader and Darryl Rouson wrote in a Tuesday letter to Massullo. Rader has not yet had an opportunity to vote on the bill's Senate companion, though Rouson twice voted in favor of the bill during committee hearings. 'Amendment could align House, Senate AOB bills[29]' via Florida Politics \u2014 Sen. Doug Broxson filed an amendment to his assignment of benefits reform bill that could bring it in line with the package passed by the House last week. In its current form, SB 122 focuses on one-way attorney fees. Broxson's strike-all amendment, however, would make the bill nearly identical to HB 7065, which passed the House with a 96-20 vote Thursday. The House bill would make changes to attorney fees based on the difference between the judgment sought by AOB contractors and what the court awards. It would also give homeowners would the ability to back out of AOB agreements and require Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-backed insurer of last resort, to pass on any savings from the reform to homeowners.

'That's the worst thing anyone can say to me,' Halpern, a resident of Palm Bay and one of Fine's constituents, said in an interview. 'I'm someone who's been a victim of anti-Semitism much of my life, and there's no worse name you can call a Jewish person that 'Judenrat.'

One bill caught in the crossfire is SB 1078, which would allow chiropractors to give vitamin and enzyme shots to their customers so long as they complete some coursework and get certified. SB 1078 is heavily supported by the Florida Chiropractic Physician Association, which says the change would give Floridians access to cost-efficient health care and better alternatives to medical palliative care.

It was part of a nationwide 'Youth Lobby Day' organized by the environmental group Our Climate, a youth-led organization created to energize younger people about climate change.

'When potential visitors see images and negative headlines about Florida, whether it's about green slime covered waterways, fish kills from red algae or damage from hurricanes, it drives traffic away from Florida's world-class destinations and toward other states that are actively funding their tourism advertising and marketing programs,' Skrob said. \u2014Powerful inscription: Each container is filled with 'really just a gooey, green/glow in the dark putty.' The top reads, 'This is what potential visitors thought Florida's waters were covered in. VISIT FLORIDA changed that.' \u2014Background: The slime is a reference to the blue-green algae that plagued Florida's Treasure Coast. As one might imagine, it only took a few New York Times articles before concerns began growing over whether visitors would write the Sunshine State off as a destination. \u2014Maybe skip the Senate?: We're hearing all legislators will receive the slime. But the Senate's shaping up to keep the agency alive. In fact, the chamber will on Wednesday consider a bill that would repeal VISIT FLORIDA's October sunset date. \u2014 WALK-IN WEDNESDAY \u2014 The Florida Education Association has organized[33] a statewide 'walk-in' Wednesday morning. Teachers, staff, parents and more will partake in walk-ins before the school day. About 400 schools are expected to participate. Fedrick Ingram, FEA president, encouraged stakeholders to 'speak now, before time runs out this Session to do the right thing for Florida's kids.' Cause: Traditional K-12 interests want more. Funding for students ranks among the bottom 10 states, FEA said. Teacher salaries, meanwhile, rank 46th. Remedy: FEA is asking[34] for a $743 bump in per-pupil funding. More details: 'Groups will gather 30 to 45 minutes before the start of the workday at schools,' FEA said.

Still, the state forecast for money coming in from sales taxes is down a little bit from forecasting just a few months ago. While still growing, the incoming tax dollars are expected to grow slower in the years ahead. General revenues, which grew by five and a half percent per year over the past two years, are slowing to less than two percent this year and averaging three and a half percent a year over the following four years, according to state estimates. The slowdown in tax revenue is leading lawmakers to slow the growth of the overall budget. 'Hoping to spur post-Michael investment, a push to expand 'opportunity zones'[36]' via Katie Landeck of the Panama City News-Herald \u2014 Opportunity zones allow investors to take their capital gainsand put it into an 'opportunity fund.' The money in that fund can then be invested into designated opportunity zones, they can defer the capital gains taxes on the money for up to 10 years and reduce the payment of those taxes by continuing to stay invested in the community. The tax savings can be huge. The idea has a lot of people thinking, including city leaders, that with the amount of damage Hurricane Michael brought to the area and the need for private investment to recover, it would be beneficial to have the whole county east of the Hathaway Bridge turned into an opportunity zone.

That won't be documented in federal records until he files personal disclosures, which are due in May. Still, Spano's initial quarter campaign disclosures include enough peculiarities to leave election observers scratching their heads and critics sharpening their knives.

But we still like to follow the in-depth interviews he's giving on his way out the door. The latest of which[55] is with Pete Saunders of Forbes Magazine. 'Being mayor is the best job in America.

'But Tampa is a young and vibrant city, less reliant on tourism than it used to be. We've been focused on changing our economic DNA, and we had to coming out of the recession.' \u2014Highs?: The Democratic Mayor pointed to hosting the RNC in 2012, along with Super Bowls and College Football championships. 'I'm just a small part in the success of this,' he added. \u2014Coming up: Expect a change in focus with the next administration.

MATTERS \u2014 'Trump to increase pressure on Cuba by lifting lawsuit limits[56]' via Peter Baker of The New York Times \u2014 The decision could open the floodgates to thousands of lawsuits against foreign companies and individuals accused of 'trafficking' in seized property. By doing so,Trumphopes to raise the pressure on Cuba, but risks another rupture with American allies in Europe and Canada that scrambled to head off the change in recent days. In his decision to lift the limits, Trump brushed aside protests by European leaders who brought their objections to Washington in past weeks. The European Union threatened last week tosuethe United States at the World Trade Organization if it proceeded, and suggested that counterclaims could be filed in European courts against American firms that took advantage of the new policy.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Donald-Trump-Florida-5.19.jpgDonald\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Donald-Trump-Florida-5.19.jpgDonald</url> Trump is putting the pressure on Cuba by upping the limits expats can sue for lost property.'Feud erupts between Scott and Chuck Schumer over Puerto Rico[57]' via Marianne Levine of POLITICO \u2014Scottcampaigned on standing up for Puerto Rico. But withTrumpwarning Senators not to provide more aid to the island, the Florida Republican is caught between his party and his promises. And Democrats are eager to exploit that tension \u2014 blasting Scott for sticking with the president on a critical disaster relief bill and throwing the freshman senator into the middle of a broader fight over stalled assistance for millions of Americans devastated by wildfires, flooding and hurricanes. 'Scott leads call to pay Coast Guard in future shutdown[58]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 Scott is leading a bipartisan effort to get a rider into the next appropriations bill that would require that U.S. Coast Guard personnel continue to receive paychecks in the event of a future government shutdown.Scott led a letter signed by eight other Senators, four Republicans and four Democrats, urging Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security to include such a provision in the 2020 Appropriations Bill now heading for their committee. What Matt Gaetz is reading \u2014 'Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quits Facebook, calls social media a 'public health risk'[59]' via Hamza Shaban of The Washington Post \u2014 In an interview with the Yahoo News podcast 'Skullduggery,' the New York Democrat said she stopped using her Facebook account and was scaling back on all social media, which she described as a 'public health risk' because it can lead to 'increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.'Ocasio-Cortezsaid her departure from Facebook was a 'big deal' because the platform had been crucial to her campaign. She still has accounts on the site, she said, and according to the company's ad library, her official Facebook account has dozens of active advertisements sponsored by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress. What everyone at Ballard Partners is reading \u2014 'Lobbying in Trump's Washington[60]' via The Economist \u2014 Last year, businesses spent more than $3.4Badvancing their interests, 8.5 percent more than before the self-styled 'CEO president' took office. Yet these sums may reflect not how easy life is for corporate America in Trump's Washington, but how difficult. The Chamber of Commerce has successfully championed massive corporate-tax cuts but failed to dissuade the President from imposing tariffs and curbing immigration. Big Pharma, which had managed to raise drug prices regardless of which party controlled the White House, is being pressed by Trump to lower them. Big Tech is among the ten most significant spenders on lobbying\u2014Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon\u2014but few friends in Washington, not least because Silicon Valley has been critical of the president, often vocally so. 'Campaign finance lawsuit against David Rivera moves on[61]' via the Miami Herald \u2014 A lawsuit dismissed against Rivera back in September is moving forward after a ruling by District Court Judge Marcia Cooke. The Federal Election Commission accused Rivera of shifting $55,000 to back a challenge to Joe Garcia, who would go on to oust Rivera from his congressional seat in 2012. Cooke had originally dismissed the suit, causing Rivera to claim vindication. But Cooke reopened the case in January and sided with the FEC Tuesday to allow the suit to continue. Rivera has denied wrongdoing. The FEC says it can prove Rivera was behind the arrangement.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://yourpacan.org\">https://yourpacan.org</url> \u2014 2020 \u2014 'Trump's 2020 plan: Target seniors on Facebook[62]' via Sara Fischer of Axios \u2014 TheTrumpcampaign is spending 44 percent of its Facebook ad budget to target users who are over 65 years old, as opposed to Democratic candidates who are only spending 27 percent of their budget on that demographic, according to data from Billy Pulpit Interactive. In the wake of huge 2018 Democratic gains among young voters, older voters will be even more critical to Trump's strategy in 2020. The Facebook algorithm will usually optimize adstowardyounger voters who are easier to reach, which reinforces the Trump campaign's commitment to consolidate its base with older voters.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-flag.jpgAhead\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-flag.jpgAhead</url> of his re-election campaign, Donald Trump is making a major play for seniors on Facebook.

In all, more than 700 donors gave to Harris's campaign and at least one other. Approximately 170 donors gave more than $200 to both Harris's andPete Buttigieg's campaigns, and roughly 166 gave to bothCory Booker's and Harris's campaigns.

'To help win the south, Congressional Democrats turn to Crist[69]' via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 While 2020 presidential candidates navigate the progressive base and the moderate middle, it's clear House SpeakerNancy Pelosibelieves her caucus needs to run as they did last November. Here's one example:Cristwas named regional vice chair for the south of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign apparatus.

We want Canada to do it for us. Our new spirit is surrender \u2014 and it's finding amazing levels of bipartisan support. Some of America's mostliberalpoliticians, including Sanders and Warren, have touted Canadian drugs for years. And nowDeSantis' own 'O Canada' proposal has broad backing as well.

'To fix Florida Virtual School, DeSantis needs to learn from Scott's mistakes[71]' via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board \u2014 AmonthslongOrlando Sentinel investigation exposed the cronyism that oozed through the school's leadership duringScott's tenure, jeopardizing the reputation and success of a public institution that became a model for other online schools around the nation. Too often, Scott appointed people to the board of trustees who already were, or later became, too cozy with the school's former general counsel and chief administrative officer,FrankKruppenbacher, one of Scott's early and eager political supporters. It seems hard to imagine that Scott couldn't have found smart, competent people who understand the nature of a boss/employee relationship, who could superviseKruppenbacherand evaluate his performance more objectively. 'Meet Florida's Mean Gang[72]' via Julie Hauserman of the FloridaPhoenix \u2014If there's one notable hallmark of this legislative session (and this political era of national Republican leadership), it is a combination of elite toxic entitlement and sheer meanness. Every day as the legislative session winds on, lawmakers take their seats for afternoon committee meetings (post-lunch with their campaign cash rainmakers at the Governor's Club, where the prying press and public are forbidden), and they often strike a cynical and weary tone at how the public they are elected to serve just doesn't seem to 'get it.' 'Jeff Johnson, Emmett Reed and SteveBahmer: Lawmakers need smart solutions for Florida's growing elder population[73]' via Florida Politics \u2014 Florida needs innovative, short- and long-term solutions to the needs of older Floridians. The Coalition for Silver Solutions, newly formed by AARP, the Florida Health Care Association, andLeadingAgeFlorida, is focused on offering policymakers a blueprint for the future of long-term in Florida. We believe a broad spectrum of innovative, high-quality care for older Floridians at every life stage makes the most efficient use of public resources. This begins by advocating for sufficient funding for home- and community-based care and for those who require it, care in long-term residential facilities. Getting older is inevitable but getting older without proper support is preventable. 'Hospital bills are bad medicine[74]' via the Ocala Star-Banner editorial board \u2014 The Legislature is entertaining measures that could have a profound and adverse impact on health care in much of Florida. At issue are bills that would end the state's certificate-of-need, or CON, process for hospitals. The process requires providers to make the case that a community is underserved and needs additional facilities. Admittedly,reformappears appealing because of the free-market argument that competition makes providers more agile and customer-centered and improves costs and services for consumers. Yet, the health care industry sometimes doesn't function under the market rules that govern the rest of commerce, which is why we urge lawmakers to reconsider deregulation. 'Protecting the quality of health care services in Florida[75]' via Dr. Michael Wiles for News-Press.com \u2014 Why would Florida want to decrease the standards for chiropractic education, something that could lead to endangering the health of Floridians? That is a question chiropractic physicians and, particularly chiropractic educators are asking themselves after the introduction of HB873 that would eliminate the requirement of chiropractic educational programs to meet the national standards achieved by all other chiropractic programs in the country. Ostensibly, the new proposal is to eliminate what the bill's sponsor (Rep.David Santiago) considers a monopoly on the accreditation process. To chiropractic educators, this sounds irresponsible.Only the CCE has prescriptive standards for chiropractic education and other accrediting bodies, such as regional accreditors, which prescribe general requirements related to operations and governance. 'Brad Swanson: Want gigabit service in your neighborhood?[76]' via Florida Politics \u2014 Our businesses use technology every day to keep Florida's economy competitive with other states and the world. Without the deployment of the best technology offered, Florida will fall behind.The cable industry has always been at the forefront of deployment. Local governments have created additional burdensome permitting processes often lasting over 6 months compared to weeks. These permitting delays have created barriers and made it difficult for companies to deliver connectivity to nearly every legislator's constituents across Florida. Florida's internet and television customers are the ones suffering and they are being left behind. This lag in deployment not only hurts the consumer, but the municipality, and our state. 'Lawmakers must agree that a rental is a rental is a rental[77]' via Brewster Bevis for the Palm Beach Post \u2014 At Associated Industries of Florida (AIF), we're proud to help spark innovative business practices that grow jobs and our economy. But we must ensure basic business principles are applied evenly. This session, AIF joins 'Driving Florida Forward' to advocate for fairness among industries facilitating car rental transactions\u2014by rental car and P2P car-sharing companies. Legislative changes are needed to bring uniformity to operators in this space regardless of the business model. First, what is P2Pcar-sharing? P2P companies create a platform where an individual can place a vehicle to rent. P2P companies aren't collecting a rental car surcharge from the renter of the vehicle. By updating Florida law, we can ensure regulatory and tax fairness within all these industries. \u2014 MOVEMENTS \u2014 'After winning award for Broward surtax ad, PR firm plans to expand Florida presence[78]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 After scooping up a 2019 Pollie Award for its work on Broward County-based ad campaign, Metropolitan Public Strategies has plans to expand its presence here in Florida.

Project supervisorGuyYachdavsaid Friday survival rates are predicted using longevity analysis similar to scientific studies used to examine the effects of medical treatments. He says although the analysis 'relies on data taken from the world of fantasy, the exact same artificial intelligence techniques are used in the real world.' The results?

In addition to it being Seersucker Day, there's all this and then some: Taking a stand against pre-emption   A diverse group of Florida organizations will stand together in front of the House of Representatives Chamber doors Wednesday morning to 'urge legislators to oppose policies that would remove local ability to pass laws stronger than the state's own laws.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/seersuckersuit.jpg;While\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/seersuckersuit.jpg;While</url> it may be Seersucker Day at The Capitol, many serious issues still need addressing this Session.The group includes the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Lung Association, Equality Florida, Florida Association of Counties, Florida Council of Churches, Florida Immigrant Coalition, Organize Florida and Surfrider Foundation Speakers include Democratic state Rep. Nick Duran of Miami, Leon County Commissioner and President-Elect for the Florida Association of Counties Nick Maddox, Florida Government Relations Director for the American Heart Association Mark Landreth, Organize Florida and Florida Immigrant Coalition spokeswoman Ida Eskamani, and Matt Jordan, Florida Government Relations Director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. They will stand against the 'state overreach' found in more than 35 bills this session   pre-emption policies that 'block local governments from doing more to protect the well-being of their communities.' 'Pre-emption is when a higher form of government, such as a state legislature, limits a lower form of government, such as a county or city council, from acting on an issue,' the release said. 'It is becoming an increasingly common state legislative tactic and extending to a greater number of issue areas. During the 2019 Legislative Session, according to the Florida League of Cities, more than 35 pre-emption bills are being considered that block local communities from responding to the needs of their citizens.' That's at 10 a.m., in Room 333 of The Capitol.   Michael's Angels will rally in Tally   We wanted to share this 'very personal' letter we received from Kristen McDonald of Hill+Knowlton Strategies in Tallahassee. Please read: 'For those of you who don't know, I was born and raised in Panama City. My family still lives there, and my childhood home was destroyed when Hurricane Michael hit six months ago (amazingly the only room left intact was the one my dad was hunkered down in with our two dogs and cat!). 'Recovery efforts in the area have been slow thus far, and many of you have covered the numerous pleas for federal and state funding to assist with those efforts. 'On Wednesday, April 17, affected residents from my hometown and the surrounding areas are traveling to Tallahassee for a 'Rally in Tally' event in the Capitol Courtyard at 10 a.m. where they will urge lawmakers to support disaster relief for the Panhandle. 'The event has been organized by the group Michael's Angels I've been told several buses have been chartered and that hundreds of people are expected to attend. Local radio personality Dr. Shane Collins of 92.5 WPAP-FM will also be broadcasting live from the bus and throughout the day. 'I know you are all so busy with Session, but this is an important issue that needs continued attention. I hope you can join this group in the Capitol Courtyard at 10 a.m. to hear their compelling stories firsthand.'   Coalition for Silver Solutions continues fight for funding   Advocates for Florida's senior population will be at the Capitol as the Coalition works to retain funding for nursing home and community care. AARP, the Florida Health Care Association, and LeadingAge Florida recently formed the coalition to help develop strategies to meet the short- and long-term health care needs of Florida's aging population. Their immediate concerns are retaining a $138 million boost in nursing home Medicaid funding provided by the Legislature in 2018 that is in jeopardy this year, along with the need to fund home and community-based services to reduce the current waitlist. 'Members of the three organizations will work the halls of the Capitol to remind lawmakers that quality care for elders is directly connected to adequate funding,' a news release said.   Also on the Capitol events calendar   Project Citizen, a program of The Florida Law Related Education Association that addresses public policy concerns, will display student projects in the Rotunda. Also:   Anglers for Lake O will be in Waller Park (next to the dolphins' fountain) starting at 10 a.m. to promote 'public awareness of water projects that will #SlowTheFlow of water coming into Lake Okeechobee.'   It's Rural Counties Day. Starting at 10 a.m., Baker, Bradford, Putnam, Union counties and the City of Keystone Heights will 'create a forum for citizens, elected officials, and business professionals to work together to highlight our business-friendly environment, and represent rural counties' specific legislative needs.'   The Oviedo-Winter Springs Chamber of Commerce meets at 1:30 p.m. on the 22nd floor 'to meet with Legislators and discuss the Legislative Session.'   The Florida Technology Council, the statewide tech association, hosts its annual event on the 22nd floor at 2 p.m.   Please consider stopping by   I have been invited to be the featured speaker at the next meeting of Capital Tiger Bay Club. That's next Tuesday, 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m., at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center in Tallahassee. The main topic of this special program will be 'A Florida nightmare: Voters without a voice[1],' a recent op-ed where I focused on HJR 57, a proposal that would dramatically change the way Floridians can amend our state Constitution. While HJR 57 may not get much play with the general populace, HRJ 57 has solicited some strong feelings among those in The Process. I will give my take, and discuss some of the leading players   both politicians and media   on the issue. An RSVP is required no later than this Friday, April 19.

Meanwhile, a business-backed taxoverhaulhad an easier time advancing in the Senate, with the proposal including a move to collect sales taxes on purchases Floridians make from many out-of-state online retailers. In a party-line, 18-9 vote, the House Appropriations Committee approved the House package (HB 7123), which includes sales-tax 'holidays' for storm preparation and back-to-school shopping and a reduction in a commercial lease tax. The bill has cleared its committees and can be taken up on the House floor.

'Lawmakers moving aid bills for Hurricane Michael[16]' via Curt Anderson ofThe Associated Press  A Senate Appropriations panel approved a pair of bills to assist with housing, debris removal, infrastructure repairs, and other needs. One measure would create a $300 million loan program out of the 'rainy day' reserve fund if lawmakers ultimately decide to approve the money in final budget negotiations. Democratic Sen.Bill Montford, who represents many of the most affected counties, said northwest Florida is still suffering months after Category 4 Hurricane Michael swept ashore in October. Congress has been unable to agree on a roughly $13 billion aid package for multiple U.S. disasters including Michael   meaning state legislators must step in, Montford said. 'Plan could help hurricane-hampered colleges[17]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida   School officials say Gulf Coast State College in Panama City lost 841 students during the spring 2019 semester.

That led Sen.George Gainerto propose a bill that would allow hurricane-impacted state colleges to waive out-of-state tuition fees when they see enrollment drop by more than 10 percent as a result of storms. The proposal (SB 1164) passed unanimously and needs to clear the Senate Appropriations Committee before it can go to the Senate floor.

Charter schools are paid for with public funds and run by private entities. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Bryan Avila, added an amendment in the House Appropriations Committee which would require charter schools that receive a slice of these funds to use them for the intended purpose of the referendums. The amendment also removed the financial penalty for school districts should they fail to share the funds with districts properly.

'Contraceptives pilot program gets Senate OK[21]' via the News Service of Florida   A Senatehealth carepanel approved a bill that would lead to establishing a pilot program that would allow women in three Florida counties to access long-acting reversible contraceptives such as intrauterine devices. Before approving the bill (SB 410), the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee removed $100,000 that would have gone to the state Department of Health for the program. It made the program subject to a legislative appropriation. The bill, sponsored by Sen.Lori Berman, would require the health department to contract with family planning providers in Duval, Hillsborough and Palm Beach counties to make long-acting contraceptives available to women seeking family planning services. 'Lawmakers carry out death benefits measure[22]' via the News Service of Florida   A Senate panel approved a proposal that would set death benefits that would be paid if law-enforcement officers, firefighters, other first responders and military members are killed while on duty. The proposal (SB 7098), sponsored by Sen.Ed Hooperwould carry out a constitutional amendment, known as Amendment 7, passed in November. The bill, in part, addresses law-enforcement officers, correctional officers, correctional probation officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, paramedics and Florida National Guard members. They would be entitled to $75,000 in death benefits if they accidentally die in the course of their duties and $225,000 if they are intentionally or illegally killed, such as if a law-enforcement officer is ambushed, Hooper said.

Rep. Anthony Rodriguez filed the legislation (HB 933). The measure requires clinics to register with the Department of Health (DOH). The legislation then allows for DOH to bar doctors from opening a new clinic for up to five years if their previous clinic is shut down for violations. A strike-all amendment detailed by Rodriguez Tuesday 'requires offices where physicians perform certain surgeries to designate a physician who is responsible for ensuring the office complies with safety requirements.' 'More civil lawsuits could be headed to county courts[24]' via Florida Politics   On Tuesday, the Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Subcommittee moved a bill that would shunt more civil lawsuits to county courts. The bill (SB 328) will move to the full Appropriations Committee on Thursday. At present, there is a $15,000 limit on damages in civil suits, also called 'small claims,' filed on the county level. This bill, as amended in committee, would raise that to $30,000 on Jan. 1, 2020, and to $50,000 by Jan. 1, 2022. The current cap hasn't been changed since 1992.

The proposal (SB 7030) includes changes that are getting broader support. Each school board and charter school governing board would be required to adopt an active assailant plan by Oct. 1 and conduct annual training. A standardized threat assessment process, used to evaluate the risk posed by a student, must be developed by Aug. 1 for use by public schools. Student records would be required to be transferred within one school day for students transferring to another school in the district.

In a letter, John Sowinski   president of Voters in Charge, the political committee behind the amendment   shared a legal opinion from lawyer Paul Hawkes, a former lawmaker and appellate judge and now a lobbyist for the greyhound industry. Hawkes said that under Amendment 3, lawmakers could not authorize sports betting or designated player games or allow slot machines permit-holders to move their slots to another location.

Democrats chide Ralph Massullo for racial comments   When the House voted on a bill to block insurers from using DNA info for actuarial decisions, GOP Rep. Ralph Massullo said it would prevent discrimination against African Americans and Jews, who 'have a long list of predisposed genetic diseases.' Senate Democrats interpreted those comments as racist, reports Alexandra Glorioso of POLITICO Florida. 'Your assertion that the use of DNA evidence, when it is part of an insurance applicant's medical record, would lead to an increase in racial and religious discrimination is not only already against the law, it is incorrect,' Sens. Kevin Rader and Darryl Rouson wrote in a Tuesday letter to Massullo.

In its current form, SB 122 focuses on one-way attorney fees. Broxson's strike-all amendment, however, would make the bill nearly identical to HB 7065, which passed the House with a 96-20 vote Thursday. The House bill would make changes to attorney fees based on the difference between the judgment sought by AOB contractors and what the court awards. It would also give homeowners would the ability to back out of AOB agreements and require Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-backed insurer of last resort, to pass on any savings from the reform to homeowners.

'When potential visitors see images and negative headlines about Florida, whether it's about green slime covered waterways, fish kills from red algae or damage from hurricanes, it drives traffic away from Florida's world-class destinations and toward other states that are actively funding their tourism advertising and marketing programs,' Skrob said.  Powerful inscription: Each container is filled with 'really just a gooey, green/glow in the dark putty.' The top reads, 'This is what potential visitors thought Florida's waters were covered in. VISIT FLORIDA changed that.'  Background: The slime is a reference to the blue-green algae that plagued Florida's Treasure Coast. As one might imagine, it only took a few New York Times articles before concerns began growing over whether visitors would write the Sunshine State off as a destination.  Maybe skip the Senate?: We're hearing all legislators will receive the slime. But the Senate's shaping up to keep the agency alive. In fact, the chamber will on Wednesday consider a bill that would repeal VISIT FLORIDA's October sunset date.

Cause: Traditional K-12 interests want more. Funding for students ranks among the bottom 10 states, FEA said. Teacher salaries, meanwhile, rank 46th. Remedy: FEA is asking[34] for a $743 bump in per-pupil funding. More details: 'Groups will gather 30 to 45 minutes before the start of the workday at schools,' FEA said.

Still, the state forecast for money coming in from sales taxes is down a little bit from forecasting just a few months ago. While still growing, the incoming tax dollars are expected to grow slower in the years ahead. General revenues, which grew by five and a half percent per year over the past two years, are slowing to less than two percent this year and averaging three and a half percent a year over the following four years, according to state estimates. The slowdown in tax revenue is leading lawmakers to slow the growth of the overall budget. 'Hoping to spur post-Michael investment, a push to expand 'opportunity zones'[36]' via Katie Landeck of the Panama City News-Herald   Opportunity zones allow investors to take their capital gainsand put it into an 'opportunity fund.' The money in that fund can then be invested into designated opportunity zones, they can defer the capital gains taxes on the money for up to 10 years and reduce the payment of those taxes by continuing to stay invested in the community. The tax savings can be huge. The idea has a lot of people thinking, including city leaders, that with the amount of damage Hurricane Michael brought to the area and the need for private investment to recover, it would be beneficial to have the whole county east of the Hathaway Bridge turned into an opportunity zone.

'Spano is still reporting nearly $180,000 in loans from 'personal funds,'' reads a DCCC news release, 'despitehis own admissionhe borrowed the funds from campaign donors in violation of campaign finance law.' Of course, the reports do not conflict with Spano's own story, that he repaid personal loans before the end of 2018. That won't be documented in federal records until he files personal disclosures, which are due in May. Still, Spano's initial quarter campaign disclosures include enough peculiarities to leave election observers scratching their heads and critics sharpening their knives.

'Meet Florida's Mean Gang[72]' via Julie Hauserman of the FloridaPhoenix  If there's one notable hallmark of this legislative session (and this political era of national Republican leadership), it is a combination of elite toxic entitlement and sheer meanness.

'Hospital bills are bad medicine[74]' via the Ocala Star-Banner editorial board   The Legislature is entertaining measures that could have a profound and adverse impact on health care in much of Florida. At issue are bills that would end the state's certificate-of-need, or CON, process for hospitals. The process requires providers to make the case that a community is underserved and needs additional facilities. Admittedly,reformappears appealing because of the free-market argument that competition makes providers more agile and customer-centered and improves costs and services for consumers. Yet, the health care industry sometimes doesn't function under the market rules that govern the rest of commerce, which is why we urge lawmakers to reconsider deregulation. 'Protecting the quality of health care services in Florida[75]' via Dr. Michael Wiles for News-Press.com   Why would Florida want to decrease the standards for chiropractic education, something that could lead to endangering the health of Floridians? That is a question chiropractic physicians and, particularly chiropractic educators are asking themselves after the introduction of HB873 that would eliminate the requirement of chiropractic educational programs to meet the national standards achieved by all other chiropractic programs in the country. Ostensibly, the new proposal is to eliminate what the bill's sponsor (Rep.David Santiago) considers a monopoly on the accreditation process.

Legislative changes are needed to bring uniformity to operators in this space regardless of the business model. First, what is P2Pcar-sharing? P2P companies create a platform where an individual can place a vehicle to rent. P2P companies aren't collecting a rental car surcharge from the renter of the vehicle. By updating Florida law, we can ensure regulatory and tax fairness within all these industries.   MOVEMENTS   'After winning award for Broward surtax ad, PR firm plans to expand Florida presence[78]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   After scooping up a 2019 Pollie Award for its work on Broward County-based ad campaign, Metropolitan Public Strategies has plans to expand its presence here in Florida. The firm, which was founded in New York in 2013 by Neal Kwatra, won the Pollie for its work on an ad supporting a penny tax in Broward County to help upgrade the county's transportation infrastructure. 'We see Florida as a crucial next step for our business, which is why we opened an office in Broward County in 2017,' Kwatra said. 'We only expect to be more of a presence in coming years.'

'201 E. Park Avenue is the premier 'class A' building in downtown,' said Ed Murray, Principal and Managing Broker of NAI TALCOR. 'We are excited that Akerman has decided to join the tenants (there). We can't wait to see their name on the side of the building.' Akerman now has offices at downtown Tallahassee's Highpoint Center on College Avenue. The Ballard Building is on the corner of Monroe Street and Park Avenue.   SUNSHINE SPORTS   America's pastime is financially robust.According to Forbes[79], all 30 franchises are worth at least $1 billion. A decade ago, only the Mets and Yankees had met that threshold. But Florida's two MLB teams rank the lowest among franchise values. Both the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays are worth about $1 billion.  Looking back: Tailing off the 2008 season   the Rays' best yet   the team value sat at about $379 million. The Rays have fielded postseason teams three times since.  Meanwhile: An ownership shakeup at the Miami Marlins was followed by one of the program's worst seasons ever. But it's easy to dismiss that as a learning-curve issue[80] for Derek Jeter, the new CEO of the team.  Keep in mind: The Marlins and Rays also are among two of the newest teams in the League. The programs don't have legacy privilege.   Enjoy the ride Orlando   The last time the Orlando Magic made the NBA playoffs was the 2011-12 season. Since then, Obama completed his second term as President. Scott was in his first term as Florida's Governor. Nelson was still in the U.S. Senate. Trump was host of a TV show[81].   Blake Snell, ace of the Tampa Bay Rays pitching staff and reigning American League Cy Young winner, broke a toe and was placed on the 10-day injured list.   He had just gotten out of the shower when, Tampa Bay Times baseball writer Marc Topkin tweeted[82], 'He decided then to move a decorative stand in the bathroom that he didn't realize was in 2 parts, and as he lifted it the bottom piece, made of granite, fell on his right foot.'  ALOE   'German students have algorithm for Game of Thrones deaths[83]' via The Associated Press   Computer science students at the Technical University of Munich have developed an application that scours the internet for data on the popular Game of Thrones series, and uses an algorithm to predict which characters are most likely to survive to the end of its final season. Project supervisorGuyYachdavsaid Friday survival rates are predicted using longevity analysis similar to scientific studies used to examine the effects of medical treatments. He says although the analysis 'relies on data taken from the world of fantasy, the exact same artificial intelligence techniques are used in the real world.' The results? Daenerys Targaryen has the highest chance of survival, at 99 percent, andBronnis the most likely to die next. 'Disney gondolas, moving 11 mph, will give bird's eye views nearly 60 feet over Walt Disney World Resort[84]' via GabrielleRussonof the Orlando Sentinel   Soon the DisneySkylinersystem of 300 gondolas, opening to the public later this fall, will carry enoughDisney-goersto roughly match the capacity of its monorail trains, company officials said. 'Our vision is, this is the most magical flight on Earth,' saidDeanHuspen, a principal architect with Walt Disney Imagineering. Disney leaders gave a construction update on the gondolas, which are in testing. All but one was covered in plastic, protecting them like a new car. They will gradually be unveiled starting around May to show off the eight bright colors and 22 Disney characters themes. Tweet, tweet:What John Lux is reading   'Here's how much money Hallmark movies are bringing to Tampa Bay[85]' via Paul Guzzo of the Tampa Bay Times   Love in the Sun, the second Hallmark movie to be made in the Tampa Bay area in recent months, expects to spend as much as $1 million in Hillsborough County during eight days of filming. On wages, it will spend an estimated $732,008 on employing 253 county residents   $677,508 on 46 crew members, $25,000 on 200 extras, $4,500 on two stand-ins, $20,000 on two members of the supporting cast and $5,000 on three 'day players,' actors who work less than three total day and have speaking lines. Those numbers are according to the production's application for Hillsborough's film incentive that provides 10 percent back on what it spends in the county.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY   We hope it's a great birthday for Majority Leader Ray Rodrigues, as well as Shannon Shepp, the executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus, Bill Dolan, and our friend, Pinellas' Tyler Payne.

I didn't get an invite, and I assume it's because the date got pushed back (hint: that's not why). Matt and I discuss a recent analysis he penned, which speculates about a possible three-way Republican presidential primary among Florida politicians Ron DeSantis, Matt Gaetz,and Rick Scott. We also talk about the prospects of Marco Rubio in 2024 and bed the question: Did that ship sail in 2016? We also weigh in on the 2022 election when DeSantis faces reelection and speculates on how the 2020 presidential election outcome could play out in that race.But Dixon calls predictions at this point, 'kind of stupid.' Dixon also laments eroding transparency in the DeSantis administration and the frequency with which he's getting crickets when he requests information. If you're feeling a little shy about your coronavirus belly, don't worry, we share plenty of lamentations about our own belly flab.

TOP STORIES   'On weekend dedicated to war dead, Donald Trump tweets insults, promotes baseless claims and plays golf[4]' via Anne Gearan of The Washington Post   As the death toll in the coronavirus pandemic neared 100,000 Americans this Memorial Day weekend, Trump derided and insulted perceived enemies and promoted a baseless conspiracy theory, in between rounds of golf. In a flurry of tweets, Trump mocked former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams's weight, ridiculed the looks of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and called former Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton a 'skank.' He revived long-debunked speculation that a television host with whom Trump has feuded may have killed a woman and asserted without evidence that mail-in voting routinely produces ballot stuffing. He made little mention of the sacrifice Americans honor on Memorial Day or the grim toll of the virus.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Trump-golfing-Memorial-day-Reuters.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Trump-golfing-Memorial-day-Reuters.jpg</url> In between bouts of rage tweeting, Donald Trump got in a little golf for Memorial Day.

McCaskill and Dan Goldberg of POLITICO   Public health officials have been vocal about the risks of a second wave of COVID-19 as states reopen businesses and more people leave their homes. But unlike overseas, where several countries have moved quickly to reinstate lockdowns at the first sign of a case spike, few state or local governments have even established guidelines for when and how they would restrict activities to contain additional outbreaks. It's not immediately clear how many states are prepared to respond to a surge in cases brought on by reopening. Some state's reopening plans acknowledge the possibility of reversing course to protect people, while others don't mention the threat of additional outbreaks at all. 'Public remarks prompted Florida virus data curator's firing[6]' via Brendan Farrington and Bobby Caina Calvan of The Associated Press   The woman who raised questions about Florida's COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data's curator had been reprimanded several times and ultimately fired for violating Health Department policy by making public remarks about the information, state records show. State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information's accuracy as Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state's battered economy following safer-at-home orders.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theojt100.com\">https://theojt100.com</url>   SITUATIONAL AWARENESS    @RealDonaldTrump: I have zero interest in moving the Republican National Convention to Doral in Miami, as falsely reported by the Fake News @nytimes[7] in order to stir up trouble.

Sampson of the Tampa Bay Times   The counties around Tampa Bay have not reported new deaths from the novel coronavirus for two straight days. A holiday weekend, coupled with a steady thaw on pandemic closures, has offered a gasp of relief for Floridians   as epidemiologists warn residents to be vigilant, staying clear of big groups, sanitizing and wearing masks in public to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19. Florida's numbers will be closely watched over the coming days, both by people here and disease specialists nationwide. Monday marks three weeks since DeSantis' phased reopening began. Over the previous day, only Pinellas and Manatee added more than a dozen cases, at 14 and 13, respectively. Those two counties, which have each had serious outbreaks of the coronavirus in nursing homes.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pensacola-Beach-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pensacola-Beach-scaled.jpg</url> Pensacola Beach was packed for Memorial Day weekend. Image via AP.;; 'Fired scientist defends her COVID-19 data role, portrays Florida Dept. of Health as corrupt[9]' via Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon of Florida Today   While she specifically makes no implication that DeSantis was involved in efforts to massage or hide information on the state's COVID-19 dashboard, Rebekah Jones paints a picture of senior FDOH officials overly eager to appease the governor and his plans to reopen the state. In an email last week, Jones said she was removed from the helm of the state's COVID-19 dashboard as of May 5, because of her commitment to 'accessibility and transparency.' Jones further alleged that she was fired for refusing to 'manually change data' to favor the reopening plan. She also defended herself against what she called DeSantis' 'shocking and salacious attempt at character assassination' which she said felt like 'a cheap political move to avoid discussing the real story here, which is how the COVID-19 data is now being manipulated.' 'DeSantis' 'whack-a-mole' approach fails the frail in nursing homes[10]' via John Pacenti and Holly Baltz of The Palm Beach Post   DeSantis' 'whack-a-mole' approach to long-term care facilities in the pandemic   as the AARP calls it   has failed. Despite the proclamations, DeSantis didn't promptly identify outbreaks in elder care facilities and is now scrambling to stem the tide of cases and deaths, a Palm Beach Post investigation has found. Florida National Guard strike teams dispatched by DeSantis last month to test at nursing homes proved to be nothing more than a flyswatter against a viral swarm. COVID-19 fatalities linked to eldercare centers comprise nearly half the deaths in Florida and the percentage rises every day. Yet nursing homes and ALF residents and staff comprise only 2 percent of the state's population. 'Democrat state Senator says DeSantis wants working-class 'exposed to the virus''[11] via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics   DeSantis, said Sen. Vic Torres, 'doesn't want' the unemployed 'to get benefits.' 'He wants you to get exposed to the virus. He wants you out there. He doesn't care what happens to you or your family,' argued the Orlando Democrat. Torres' comments about what the Governor calls a 'smart, safe, and step-by-step' reopening of the state were made on a Saturday afternoon call in support of the Joe Biden Presidential campaign. 'FDA investigates lab as tens of thousands of COVID-19 test results in Florida are questioned[12]' via Bailey Gallion and Jayne O'Donnell of USA Today   Federal regulators are investigating a Texas laboratory that a Florida hospital chain dropped last week because of delayed and unreliable COVID-19 test results. AdventHealth, which has 45 hospitals in nine states, terminated its Florida contract with MicroGen DX due to concerns about the validity of some of the 60,000 tests MicroGen had processed for the system because the lab left them at room temperature for days. AdventHealth said it is notifying about 25,000 patients who got unreliable or delayed results. It is advising them to seek medical care and retesting if they tested negative but have COVID symptoms. 'How COVID-19 is clouding government transparency[13]' via Jenna Bourne of WTSP   'A public record is any material made or received by a government agency that facilitates its official business Documents, texts, emails,' Florida First Amendment Foundation President Pamela Marsh said. 'We've found that government agencies are taking advantage of this crisis to take an exemption and sort of mold it the way they want it,' Marsh said. The pandemic has had a chilling effect on access to public information. 'It's slowed it down tremendously. Slowed it down to almost a standstill,' Marsh said. '[I'm] incredibly disappointed and scared, frankly. In a crisis like this, we should have access to as much information   accurate information, as we can get, so that we know how to protect ourselves and our families.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thesoutherngroup.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f257c19c6a0d18da576bffc85id=709ea82228 \">https://thesoutherngroup.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f257c19c6a0d18da576bffc85id=709ea82228 </url>FLORIDA REOPENING  ; ICYMI   'Ron DeSantis: Florida' lifting all restrictions on youth activities'[14]' via Kirby Wilson, C.T.

The declaration was the governor's latest move to wake Florida from its coronavirus-induced economic slumber.

The plan includes the reopening of Universal Studios Florida, Universal's Islands of Adventure and Universal's Volcano Bay. Universal will soon schedule team members for training on its new procedures, with limited previews in the days leading up to the public opening, when Universal will continue to manage daily attendance. 'Daniel Uhlfelders' Grim Reaper Tour gains notoriety and appearance on The Daily Show[16]' via Tom McLaughlin of the NWF Daily News   AttorneyUhlfelder has been prowling the Northwest Florida coastline dressed as the grim reaper to bring attention to the hazards of opening beaches with coronavirus still lingering. His Grim Reaper Tour has garnered national notoriety. Uhlfelder was recently interviewed by Michael Kosta and appeared with Kosta for a segment of The Daily Show. Sequestered somewhere in New York, Kosta seemed bent on making fun of Floridians flaunting the coronavirus by flocking to the state's beaches. He even asked Uhlfelder, who agreed to unmask for the interview, if maybe state residents shouldn't be doing something better than sunbathing at this time, like learning to read.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ulhfelder.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ulhfelder.jpg</url> Daniel Uhlfelders' Grim Reaper Tour gets some national exposure on The Daily Show.

Judge orders ICE to disclose data[17]' via Monique O. Madan of the Miami Herald   A Miami federal judge has ordered U.S. immigration officials to disclose whether the government's practice of transferring detainees from one facility to another has contributed to a worrying spike in coronavirus cases inside three South Florida detention centers. The order comes after COVID-19 cases at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broward County skyrocketed last week after dozens of detainees were transferred there from Miami-Dade. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the increase in cases came after 33 detainees were transferred from Krome to BTC on May 14. 'Hialeah ALF shuttered by state after dozens of staff, residents, sickened with COVID-19[18]' via Ben Conarck, Bianca Padr\u00f3 Ocasio and Aaron Liebowitz of the Miami Herald   By the time Florida health officials arrived to survey the Salmos 23 V LLC assisted living facility in Hialeah, 47 residents had already been hospitalized with COVID-19. Inspectors found a facility they deemed woefully unprepared to deal with the highly contagious respiratory virus. An employee that the facility knew tested positive for the virus was taking the temperatures of other staff members entering the facility while wearing no personal protective equipment. The inspectors' initial observation was cited in an emergency order by the state Friday night suspending the facility's license.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home1-salmos23.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home1-salmos23.jpg</url> The Salmos 23 ALF in Hialeah was closed by the state after dozens of staff and residents tested positive for COVID-19. 'Keys nursing home didn't report 13 deaths, including 7 possibly from COVID-19, report says[19]' via David Goodhue of the Miami Herald   A Florida Keys nursing home that has become a cluster for novel coronavirus cases did not report the deaths of 13 people at the facility to the state Department of Health. The medical director of the facility told inspectors she did order COVID-19 tests for the seven people. It's not clear from the report if the tests were ever conducted. The report not only highlights the opaque nature of the communications between the facility's management and state health officials, as well as relatives of those living inside, it adds confusion over the official number of people who have contracted COVID-19, and died from it, in the Florida Keys. The official death count from the disease in the Keys is three people since early April. 'Masks mandatory: Miami-Dade beaches to reopen amid COVID-19, but with new rules[20]' via Martin Vassolo and Aaron Liebowitz of the Miami Herald   Face masks will be required to enter Miami-Dade County beaches when they reopen June 1 but not when visitors are in the water or maintaining social distance, according to a draft guide to reopen beaches circulated by the county. Sunbathing, walking and jogging will be allowed, as will the renting of beach concessions like lounge chairs and umbrellas. But no groups bigger than 10 people will be allowed to gather, and common areas like picnic tables and playgrounds will stay off-limits. Facial coverings will be required at beach restrooms and at concession stands, and access to restrooms will be limited to observe social distancing. 'Back to the beach: Lifeguards prepare for reopening after coronavirus closures[21]' via Linda Robertson of the Miami Herald   Lifeguards' essential duties won't change but they will expand to include enforcement of social distancing rules. In their interaction with the public, they'll be wearing N95 masks. While handling medical emergencies on the beach or adjacent roadways, they'll don extra personal protection equipment. Water rescue protocol will stay the same   they can't wear masks while swimming   but they'll be more cautious about contact with a victim. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, lifeguards tried to manage rescues without physical contact. 'Not just beaches: Pools in multifamily buildings can reopen June 1 in Miami-Dade[22]' via Aaron Liebowitz of the Miami Herald   Swimming pools in private multifamily buildings can reopen Monday, June 1, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced as he continues to pull back on social distancing measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The reopening date aligns with the county's reopening of beaches. Gimenez has yet to release the rules that people will have to follow, saying only that the pool reopenings will be 'subject to certain restrictions.' 'Getting ripped, politically: City-county battle over gyms reopens old wounds[23]' via Steve Bousquet of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The politics of the pandemic have driven a new wedge between two old adversaries: Ft. Lauderdale and Broward County. The latest trouble erupted when the city gave the go-ahead for commercial gyms to reopen Monday subject to a series of 10 safeguards and in accordance with Ron DeSantis' full Phase I executive order. Then the county balked and said those gyms should remain closed, that the governor's executive order gave the county the power to override the city. The fight isn't so much about gyms as it is about intergovernmental animosity that has festered for decades between two crotchety old neighbors who just can't get along, to the detriment of civic progress.

The Walt Disney World location would be a one-stop-shop for games, practices, and housing for players, the league added. Should the plan come to pass, it would fulfill a policy goal of DeSantis, who has maintained during the period of economic and movement restrictions he put in place this spring that people are 'starved for content' in the sports realm.

Some have outgrown church parking lots, shifting to venues like the Lee Civic Center and Hendry-LaBelle rodeo arena to avoid traffic jams. Organizations report feeding two to 20 times more people than usual. Community Cooperative in Fort Myers served more than 800 households from mobile food pantries in April 2019. This April, it served more than 4,000. Midwest Food Bank went from handing out about 700,000 pounds of food a month to Southwest Florida agencies before the pandemic to nearly 2 million pounds in April. 'Socially distant Wings of Gold: How the Navy is honoring naval aviators during COVID-19[27]' via Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal   Seven people from the U.S. Navy's HT-18 squadron at NAS Whiting Field got their wings of gold last week in a socially distant ceremony with few attendees, a far cry from the pomp and circumstance that usually accompanies one of naval aviation's most time-honored traditions. The new aviators were 'winged' by either a spouse or a close friend in a short outdoor ceremony.

'Midtown favorites Finnegan's Wake, Fifth and Thomas close for good[29]' via Marina Brown of the Tallahassee Democrat   The prime movers behind Midtown Tallahassee's Finnegan's Wake Irish bar and Fifth and Thomas music venue right next door, announced this weekend that they will not be reopening. 'Our leases are expiring and the uncertainty of times going forward have contributed to this decision.' That, coupled with the governor's call for restrictions on restaurants and bars and the general uncertainty of keeping the venues viable long-term, led to the decision that, though hard, seemed right. Even now, bars must remain closed and eateries can operate at only 50% dine-in capacity.

The pandemic that first struck in major metropolises is now increasingly finding its front line in the country's rural areas; counties with acres of farmland, cramped meatpacking plants, out-of-the-way prisons, and few hospital beds. Rural counties now have some of the highest rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, topping even the hardest-hit New York City boroughs and signaling a new phase of the pandemic that could devastate still more of America's most vulnerable towns as states lift stay-at-home orders.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-testing-Kansas.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-testing-Kansas.jpg</url>Kansas National Guard members wait for cars during a lull in people seeking tests at a coronavirus testing site in Dodge City, Kansas.

'Spike in D.C. numbers, crowds at Maryland, Virginia beaches and boardwalks renew coronavirus concerns[31]' via Joe Heim, Rebecca Tan, Laura Vozzella and Julie Zauzmer of The Washington Post   As the total number of coronavirus infections in the Washington region topped 90,000 and fatalities hit 3,880, a one-day spike in the District's numbers raised questions about whether it can begin reopening as expected on Friday. The District on Sunday recorded five deaths and 144 new infections, just above the seven-day average of 141. The city had eyed May 29 as the date to gradually begin reopening following the mayor's lengthy stay-at-home order. The stay-at-home and business closure orders were scheduled to run through June 8. 'Doctors are tweeting about coronavirus to make facts go viral[32]' via Georgia Wells of The Wall Street Journal   Scientists are driven to participate on social media due to 'sheer frustration with seeing the misinformation that is going out there,' said Karen James, an independent researcher and an expert in how scientists use social media. Twitter Inc., which this week said it would start labeling misleading tweets about COVID-19, also says it aims to amplify medical voices on the platform. Twitter said it has verified hundreds of COVID-19 experts globally, including scientists and academics. Verifying users adds a blue checkmark to their profiles that confer status and indicates that the company has confirmed the user's credentials. 'Administration leaves testing responsibility to states in report to Congress[33]' via Amy Goldstein of The Washington Post   The Trump administration is pledging to buy 100 million swabs by the year's end and distribute them to states to help expand the nation's capacity to test for the novel coronavirus. The administration's report doubles down on the administration's stance that individual states, not the federal government, should bear primary responsibility for carrying out diagnostic tests to help curb the pandemic. The plan arrived as the nation's COVID-19 cases exceeded 1.6 million and deaths closed in on 100,000   both the highest in the world.  'Study estimates 24 states still have uncontrolled coronavirus spread[34]' via Joel Achenbach, Rachel Weiner and Isaac Stanley-Becker of The Washington Post   The coronavirus may still be spreading at epidemic rates in 24 states, particularly in the South and Midwest. It is a snapshot of a transitional moment in the pandemic and captures the patchwork nature across the country of COVID-19. The model shows that in the majority of states, a second wave looms if people abandon efforts to mitigate the viral spread. The model shows potentially ominous scenarios if people move around as they did previously and do so without taking precautions. 'COVID-19 patients not infectious after 11 days[35]' via Yoolim Lee of Bloomberg   COVID-19 patients are no longer infectious after 11 days of getting sick even though some may still test positive, according to a new study. A positive test 'does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus,' a joint research paper said. The virus 'could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness.' The paper was based on a study of 73 patents in Singapore. The latest findings may have implications on the country's patient discharge policy. The discharge criteria is currently based on negative test results rather than infectiousness. 'White House goal on testing nursing homes unmet[36]' via Alan Suderman of The Associated Press   Nearly two weeks ago the White House urged governors to ensure that every nursing home resident and staff member be tested for the coronavirus within 14 days. It's not going to happen. Only a handful of states, including West Virginia and Rhode Island, have said they've already tested every nursing home resident. Some states aren't even bothering to try to meet the White House's request. Many states said the logistics, costs and workforce needs are too great to test all residents and staff in a two-week window. Some say they need another week or so, while others say they need much more time.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Birx.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Birx.jpeg</url> Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks with reporters about the coronavirus.

'U.S. to restrict travel From Brazil to stem coronavirus spread[37]' via Catherine Lucy of The Wall Street Journal   The White House imposed restrictions on travel from Brazil, a hot spot of the pandemic in the developing world. Under the new measures set for this week, foreign nationals who have been in Brazil within 14 days before trying to enter the U.S. would be banned, with some exceptions. The South American nation has the second-most confirmed COVID-19 cases after the U.S. Exemptions to the ban include lawful permanent residents of the U.S., foreign nationals who are married to a U.S. citizen and foreign nationals who are the parent or legal guardian of an underage U.S. citizen. 'One final viral infusion: Trump's move to block travel from Europe triggered chaos and a surge of passengers from the outbreak's center[38]' via Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey and Aaron C. Davis of The Washington Post   The Trump administration's response to the threat from Europe proved consequential to the majority of the more than 94,000 people who have died and the 1.6 million now infected in the United States. Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. However, the travel mayhem was triggered by many of the same problems that plagued the U.S. response to the pandemic from the outset: Early warnings were missed or ignored. Coordination was chaotic or nonexistent. Key agencies fumbled their assignments. Many travelers were left in limbo. 'The coronavirus is deadliest where Democrats live[39]' via Jennifer Medina and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times  The devastation, in other words, has been disproportionately felt in blue America, which helps explain why people on opposing sides of a partisan divide that has intensified in the past two decades are thinking about the virus differently. Democrats are far more likely to live in counties where the virus has ravaged the community, while Republicans are more likely to live in counties that have been relatively unscathed by the illness, though they are paying an economic price. Counties won by Trump in 2016 have reported just 27 percent of the virus infections and 21 percent of the deaths. In some parts of red America, cities have been virtually unscathed and the sparsely populated outlying areas have been hardest hit. 'How a small Michigan company reopened, averting a coronavirus outbreak[40]' via Steven Mufson of The Washington Post   United Precision Products was deemed an essential business and so it stayed open in March when the rest of the state shut down. Then an employee contracted the coronavirus and ended up in a hospital's intensive care unit. When a second worker came down with virus symptoms, the company temporarily shut its doors for a week and hired a firm whose technicians came in hazmat suits and sanitized the entire place. Even papers on the desk of the vice president were sprayed and left with the edges curling upward. When the company reopened, testing commenced and positive workers were immediately sent home and told to contact their doctors immediately. 'As Trump pushes for reopenings, congregations choose safety over haste[41]' via Rick Rojas and Elizabeth Dias of The New York Times   For the most part, churches across the country have not yet thrown open their doors. Instead, as in so many sectors of American life that have been disrupted, religious communities are stepping gingerly toward the post-shutdown world. The coming days bring a significant test. Many houses of worship have laid the groundwork for returning, and expect to resume some form of in-person worshipping next week. The discourse has grown increasingly political. Conservative churches in states under stay-at-home orders have pushed back against restrictions on worship, and Trump weighed in on behalf of one of his key constituencies, threatening on Friday to try to overrule governors who refuse to allow houses of worship to open.   CORONA ECONOMICS   'For economy, worst of coronavirus shutdowns may be over[42]' via Harriet Torry and Josh Mitchell of The Wall Street Journal   Truckloads are growing again. Air travel and hotel bookings are up slightly. Mortgage applications are rising. And more people are applying to open new businesses. These are among some early signs the U.S. economy is, ever so slowly, creeping back to life. Current projections have the economy contracting by 6% to 7% this year and unemployment lingering in double-digit percentages for a while. But, for the first time since the pandemic forced widespread U.S. business closures in March, it appears conditions in some corners of the economy aren't getting worse, and might even be improving.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-reopening.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-reopening.jpg</url> The latest hopeful economic signs coincide with the slow reopening of several states, including Pennsylvania.

So who's rushing back to the office?[43]' via Andres Viglucci and Rebecca San Juan of the Miami Herald   Having discovered the joys, savings and surprising efficacy of having employees work remotely during the pandemic, executives and workers at a broad range of law, accounting and architecture firms, banks, public relations and marketing agencies and trade and business groups say they're perfectly content to keep doing so   at least in the near future, and quite possibly beyond. No, it probably won't spell the end of the office, as some pundits have posited. But none of the executives who spoke to the Miami Herald are demanding that employees return to their office desks right away, with some exceptions for essential personnel who need to be in-house, like tech teams maintaining servers.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://BeckerCovid19.com\">http://BeckerCovid19.com</url>   MORE CORONA   'A new study says the malaria drug touted (and taken) by Trump looks deadly for coronavirus patients[44]' via Dan Vergano of BuzzFeed News   The malaria drug that Trump has said he is taking as a coronavirus preventive, hydroxychloroquine, was linked to a higher rate of deaths and serious heart problems. The drug, also used to treat arthritis and lupus, has emerged as a medical flashpoint in the coronavirus pandemic. Patients given a combination of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, taken with or without an antibiotic as some regimens suggested, died at a higher rate compared to the patients who didn't get the drug. 'How Russia's coronavirus crisis got so bad[45]' via Michele A. Berdy of POLITICO   Many Russians ignored the increasingly stringent lockdown measures instituted in Moscow beginning March 25. They didn't practice social distancing, traveled all over the city, used services that were supposed to be closed, got together with friends, sniffed, sneezed, coughed and even spat in public. Vladimir Putin has been giving addresses to the nation almost every week promising a safe deliverance from COVID-19 and aid for those who need it, but he is leaving the day-to-day decisions to local leaders and has barely left his residence outside Moscow. Russia has pledged only about 2.8 percent of GDP to aid primarily small- and medium-sized businesses. The American bailout, by contrast, is close to 10 percent of GDP so far.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Russia-coronavirus.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Russia-coronavirus.jpg</url> No social distancing and a mistrust of authority led to Russians to ignore the stringent lockdown measures in Moscow.

What Ron DeSantis is reading   'Coronavirus shutdowns are making golf courses an oasis for stir-crazy Americans eager to get out and tee it up[46]' via Jena McGregor of The Washington Post   Across the country, Americans remain deeply divided about leaving the house for work and leisure activities, except, apparently, when it comes to golf, giving an unexpected jolt to a sport that has seen declining popularity. It's too early to say whether the heightened demand will continue, especially in the middle of an economic recession, or how much the cost of safety protocols will affect course revenue. Some in the golf industry are hoping that the interest in a relatively safe outdoor activity   and the expected return of the PGA Tour to television on June 11, at a time when there are few alternatives for watching live sports   could boost enthusiasm for the game. 'College football's game of chicken with state officials[47]' via Laine Higgins and Louise Radnofsky of The Wall Street Journal   The most intense event in college athletics right now is a game of chicken among conferences, universities and state officials over whether they will reopen campus in the fall   and therefore unlock the ability to begin a football season. It's a game that is playing out in wildly different ways across the country, suggesting that a chaotic run-up to the 2020 season is ahead. Decisions rest not with athletic directors, but university presidents and their bosses   the governor of each state. None of the game's organizing bodies   the NCAA and big conferences   has the power to dictate a consistent outcome. No one wants to be responsible for stopping the season. 'Our romantic relationships are actually doing well during the pandemic, study finds[48]' via Lisa Bonos of The Washington Post   A recent poll found that most people in relationships are satisfied with them, despite the expected stresses that might come from, say, working from home together, losing a job, managing kids at home or preventing your family from getting the virus. About three-quarters of Americans with a romantic partner say their relationship has not fundamentally changed since the coronavirus outbreak. Argument frequency and sex lives have changed for the better, but only slightly. About half expect their relationship will emerge stronger   and hardly any think it'll be worse. Married partners are more likely than unmarried ones to say their relationship has not changed. Most say their relationship isn't adding to pandemic stress   but women are a little more affected than men.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-relationships.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-relationships.jpeg</url> Couples were confused about whether they could still meet up under Boris Johnson's new lockdown rules.

'Reopening[49] too soon: Lessons from the deadly second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic[50]' via Adriana Usero of The Washington Post   As coronavirus lockdowns loosen and some Americans flock to restaurants, beaches, and other outdoor spaces for Memorial Day weekend, the question of reopening too quickly is striking an eerily familiar tone. The global flu epidemic of 1918 remains the deadliest on record. The research sought an answer to a key question: Was social distancing effective in 1918 as a way of slowing the spread of the disease and saving lives? In fact, statewide orders making masks mandatory and shuttering nonessential businesses were widespread in 1918. But varying levels of enforcement combined with World War I created a variety of outcomes in 1918. That fall marked the disease's second and deadliest wave in the United States.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medicineassistancetool.org/en\">https://medicineassistancetool.org/en</url>D.C.

The plans are still under discussion but could include the establishment of a White House-created commission that would examine allegations of online bias and censorship. Facebook Inc., which also owns Instagram, defended its practices when asked for a response to the nascent proposal. Jon Berroya, interim president of the Internet Association, a trade group, disputed the contention that tech companies tilt left. Conservative groups in particular contend that big tech platforms engage in viewpoint bias in search rankings, news feeds, content moderation and other practices.

'What happens if a hurricane hits during the pandemic[61]?' via Patricia Mazzei of The New York Times   A mild storm might not require many evacuations. People with newer homes built to withstand strong winds could be safer sheltering in place than leaving their homes. After a storm leaves, new concerns could emerge. Amid the economic crisis, more people could need meals, perhaps for a week or more. And electricity would likely take longer to restore because utility crews would be working under unusual conditions. If a big storm comes this summer, people in harm's way may hear somewhat contradictory and perhaps confusing orders: Stay at home and remain socially distant from others to avoid contracting the coronavirus. But leave home, even if that means coming into closer contact with other people, to be safe during a dangerous hurricane.

Mandy Cohen, the state's health and human services secretary, said last week that the GOP should 'plan for the worst' as mass gatherings will be a 'very big challenge' if the number of coronavirus cases in the state continues to increase. The Democratic Party has already postponed its convention, scheduled to be held in Milwaukee, from July to August.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Roy-Cooper.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Roy-Cooper.jpeg</url>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper was at the business end of a Donald Trump tweetstorm. Image via AP. 'Florida Republicans would welcome convention after Trump threatens to leave Charlotte[72]' via David Smiley and Steve Contorno of the Miami Herald   Florida Republicans said they would 'welcome' the Republican National Convention if Trump makes good on a Twitter threat to pull the party's seminal political event from North Carolina. A change in venue so late in the process would be difficult. One Republican fundraiser questioned whether donors who contributed to the Charlotte host committee would allow their money to be used to sponsor an event in a different state. Local officials spent $48 million in 2012 when Tampa hosted the Republican National Convention, with those costs covered by a federal security grant. 'Trump sees a 'rigged election' ahead. Democrats see a constitutional crisis in the making.[73]' via David Siders of POLITICO   Trump threatened to withhold federal funding because of his assertion that both states were preparing to commit voter fraud through mail-in ballot applications. Then, Trump followed up Sunday with two more broadly-worded warnings that November would be 'the greatest Rigged Election in history.' Trump's increasingly amped-up rhetoric surrounding the integrity of the November election is beginning to bring to center stage a previously muted conversation. His opponents are becoming increasingly anxious that Trump may attempt to undermine the results of the election if he loses   or worse, might attempt to cling to power regardless of the outcome. The idea itself isn't new. Dating back even before his entry into electoral politics, the president has had a long preoccupation with voter fraud and 'rigged' elections. 'Trump sows doubt on voting. It keeps some people up at night.[74]' via Reid J. Epstein of The New York Times   Anxiety has intensified in recent weeks as the president continues to attack the integrity of mail voting and insinuate that the election system is rigged, while his Republican allies ramp up efforts to control who can vote and how. Joe Biden, for his part, has suggested more than once that Trump might try to disrupt or delay the election. A recent comment by the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner about whether the election would be held as scheduled renewed fears that Trump would try to move the election, or discredit the balloting process, if he thought he was going to lose. 'The pandemic has already altered how tens of millions of Americans can cast their ballots this year[75]' via Elise Viebeck of The Washington Post   In a watershed moment for American voting, nearly 30 states have changed rules or practices for this year's primaries or the general election in response to the public health threat posed by COVID-19. The new policies affect roughly 86.6 million registered voters. With November less than six months away, the largely bipartisan wave of change has been hit by political turbulence as Trump raises unfounded doubts about the security of voting by mail and threatens to punish states where Democratic leaders are facilitating it. ''Always an afterthought.' Strategists question Joe Biden strategy to win Florida Latinos[76]' via Bianca Padr\u00f3 Ocasio and David Smiley of the Miami Herald   Biden's campaign this week hired a national senior Latino adviser, began to sharply attack Trump over the state's Latino unemployment rate and moved to host regular Spanish-language virtual chats with Florida allies. Activists still worry that Biden has done too little with Hispanic voters to take back Florida from Trump. Democrats widely blamed narrow losses in races for Governor and U.S. Senate on poor Hispanic outreach. Even though polls have found Biden slightly ahead of Trump in Florida, the Hispanic vote could be critical.  'Val Demings is on Biden's VP list. She says she has the 'real-life' experience for the job.[77]' via Henry Gomez of BuzzFeed News   Demings said she believes her experience as a social worker and police chief distinguishes her from other women Biden is considering for the vice-presidential nomination. Biden, a former vice president, has promised to pick a woman as his running mate and has confirmed Demings is among the 'close to a dozen' his campaign is considering. Demings framed her case around what she would bring to an administration that Biden has pitched as a bridge to a new generation of leaders.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/val-demings.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/val-demings.jpg</url> Val Demings says her 'real-life experience' would make her a good pick as Joe Biden's Vice President. 'Black activists warn Biden: Don't pick Amy Klobuchar as VP[78]' via Elena Schneider of POLITICO   More than a dozen black and Latino strategists and activists warned in interviews that selecting Klobuchar would not help Biden excite black voters   and might have the opposite effect. Klobuchar would 'risk losing the very base the Democrats need to win,' said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, which promotes women of color in politics. It's not yet clear how much the opposition of activists matters to Biden. He's made clear that the electoral politics of his pick matters less than choosing someone who can be a governing partner and step into the top job without worry.

'Casey Askar ties coronavirus to border wall in latest ad.[79]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   Askar's newest advertisement ties an immigration suspension over the pandemic to the need for a border wall. The newest spot from the Congressional candidate contrasts a computer dashboard showing coronavirus spread worldwide against cars lined up at U.S. checkpoints. The ad, entitled 'Once and For All,' moves from imagery around the COVID-19 pandemic to footage of Trump standing by portions of the border wall under construction between Mexico and the U.S. Askar states in the ad that more immigrants come to America than any other country on earth. Askar himself immigrated to the United States as a child, a part of his story stressed in prior ads. His family moved to the U.S. from Iraq, fleeing the Saddam Hussein regime on the candidate's seventh birthday.

'I've got so many emotions, so many feelings right now,' Donalds said in a clip posted to Twitter. 'I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,' Biden said. For Donalds, who kicked off his campaign for Congress by declaring himself a 'Trump-supporting' 'black man,' the comment hit home. Most of all, Donalds said he could not tolerate anyone's blackness being put into question over their politics. Ted Deutch Endorses Tina Polsky for SD 29   Deutch Is endorsing Polsky to succeed Sen.

Skidmore is running to succeed Rep. Tina Polsky who is vacating her seat to run in Senate District 29. Skidmore previously served two terms in the House from 2006 until 2010. Rader caused a series of shuffles after he withdrew his election bid earlier this week. Skidmore announced her candidacy Thursday morning. Skidmore will be competing against Delray Beach lawyer Michael D. Weinstein for the Democratic nomination. The district leans heavily Democratic. 'As COVID-19 forces campaigns to go digital, Florida Democrats lag behind GOP[83]' via Samantha J. Gross of the Tampa Bay Times   When the COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down in-person campaign operations for the 2020 election in March, staff and volunteers to the left and the right had to quickly become strategic, nimble and most of all, 100% digital. Democrats are in the process of beefing up their digital staff by hiring 12 organizers for managing social media platforms. Democrats have a long way to go to catch up with Republicans, who have logged over 6.2 million calls to Florida voters since they switched to a virtual campaign March 12, compared to Democrats' 1.6 million. 'Broward Sheriff's election is all about issues   not race, bigotry. There's no argument.[84]' via Al Pollock with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The election for Sheriff of Broward County has nothing to do with bigotry or politics and everything to do with righteous facts. Gregory Tony diminishes the integrity and honor of the law enforcement profession in which employees are held to the highest standard. Tony, who uses his childhood in Philadelphia's drug-infested neighborhood like a shield of honor to blind people to the reality of his dishonorable behavior, was not properly vetted and provided fabricated information to obtain a government position. If something is not done to remove Tony from office, it sets an unethical standard.

It's something new in history. We will look back on it, however, it turns out, with a certain wonder. In those two months we learned a lot. How intertwined and interconnected our economy is, how provisional, how this thing depended on that. But the biggest things I suspect we learned were internal. No matter what you do for a living, when you weren't busy introspection knocked on the door and settled in.   OPINIONS   'America's[88] seniors, sacrificed on the altar of reopening[89]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post   For frail seniors in the United States, there simply is no haven. The unspoken, if inherent, trade-off in reopening the economy without safeguards is the lives of our elders. With flawed tests yielding false negatives of 12 percent to 40 percent, even facilities trying hardest can't reliably fight the virus. The lack of protective equipment is also glaring. Virtually all facilities are reusing single-use equipment. Seniors are well aware that the current administration has essentially offered them up as sacrifices on the altar of economic recovery. By opening up commerce without a haven for our seniors, the Trump administration and its gubernatorial mimics have failed America's moral test utterly. 'There is one ingredient essential to reopening the economy, and still no federal plan to get it[90]' via The Washington Post editorial board   Diagnostic testing will be critical to our ability to manage lives, jobs, schools and health if there are delays in a vaccine's development and distribution. Yet we still lack a federal strategy to get there. Diagnostic testing is important, absent a vaccine or therapy, as part of a concerted effort to identify the sick, isolate and treat them, and allow everyone else to get back to business. Right now, testing is the foundation of state decisions about reopening, yet the testing landscape is disorderly and inadequate. Another worrisome question mark is testing accuracy. Quick tests are still producing too many false-negative results. 'How to safely reopen 'closed communities' such as Florida's universities[91]' via Dr. William Greenough of the Tampa Bay Times   As Florida begins to reopen and the state universities plan to welcome students back to campus in the fall, we can use a less disruptive and more effective measure that has two prongs: quick tests to identify who has the coronavirus and   this is key   then rely on members of a community to locate those who might have had contact with the ones who test positive. This process can work in relatively closed communities such as universities that are less at risk. The first basic step is to promptly identify the earliest cases in any community. Then comes the hard part: Anyone who tests positive must be strictly quarantined for two to three weeks. 'Believing that firing of COVID-19 data manager is a 'nonissue' just got a lot harder[92]' via the Florida Today editorial board   DeSantis' explanation that the firing of Jones from the Florida Department of Health is a 'nonissue,' and that she is an underqualified disgruntled employee of questionable character, just got a lot harder to believe. Jones said she deserves an investigation into what she described as efforts by DOH leadership to manipulate data to help the governor's reopening plans. Jones gave enough cover for the governor to do the right thing: She wrote in a statement on her website, that she 'never stated nor implied that the Governor was involved with asking me to manipulate, delete and hide data.' 'Is Wall Street Journal right? Is Florida' well-managed?' It depends[93]' via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page assailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this week for seeking more federal aid to cope with the coronavirus. If the sole criterion for good management is low taxes, as the Journal's seems to be, then Florida qualifies. But not if the standard is defined as serving and protecting the public. The multitudes of laid-off workers who couldn't get through to Florida's CONNECT unemployment compensation system would hardly rate Florida as favorably as the Journal does. Neither would the motorists driven to despair by the SunPass toll-collection debacle. 'Florida's[94] state education officials have made civic literacy a joke[95]' via Bob Holladay of Florida Phoenix   Members of Florida's State Board of Education, appointed positions that do not really require any expertise in education, amply demonstrated on the morning of May 13 when, with nary a question or a comment, they approved a controversial new rule about civic literacy requirements. Generally students are now required to 'demonstrate competency in civic literacy,' under legislation passed by the Florida Legislature in 2017. Civic literacy means an understanding of history and how government works, and people my age are worried that people their age, who are going to run the country sooner instead of later, will be even worse at it than we are.        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flchamber.com\">https://www.flchamber.com</url>   TODAY'S SUNRISE   Florida has entered uncharted territory, according to the latest stats from the U.S. Department of Labor. The Sunshine State now has an unemployment rate of 12.9%   the highest since they started the current counting system back in the 1970s. There are at least 1,218,000 jobless Floridians; more than any time in state history. DeSantis reacts to those numbers, as Sunrise does another deep dive on Florida's unemployment mess. Also, on today's Sunrise:   DeSantis isn't letting those jobless numbers dampen his enthusiasm for reopening the state. He's saying it's OK to send kids off to summer camp (as well as other outdoor activities) to get them out of the house and back into social circles.   The Tallahassee woman who was fired by the health department after going public with her concerns about manipulating COVID-19 data does her first interview since DeSantis threw her under the bus. Although the Governor said she was fired for insubordination, Jones told CNN she was canned for refusing to change the stats to match his desire to reopen smaller counties that didn't meet the guidelines for reopening   The DeSantis administration loses another legal battle over the voting rights of former felons. A federal judge says the state cannot demand payment from ex-cons to get their voting rights restored if they don't have the money. And he's not just talking about restitution. The judge says court fines and fees are a tax and as such cannot be a precondition to the restoration of voting rights.   Checking in with a Florida Man arrested for trying to go home.

Only one venue, however, actually required patrons to arrive in an automobile: the drive-in movie theater, whose enormous screens and overflowing parking lots used to be as ubiquitous as the golden arches of McDonald's. During the pandemic, however, Americans are giving drive-ins a fresh look. The doors of multiplexes and art houses are shut, but drive-ins in all but a handful of states have been given the all-clear to start running movies again.

I didn't get an invite, and I assume it's because the date got pushed back (hint: that's not why). Matt and I discuss a recent analysis he penned, which speculates about a possible three-way Republican presidential primary among Florida politicians Ron DeSantis, Matt Gaetz,and Rick Scott. We also talk about the prospects of Marco Rubio in 2024 and bed the question: Did that ship sail in 2016? We also weigh in on the 2022 election when DeSantis faces reelection and speculates on how the 2020 presidential election outcome could play out in that race.But Dixon calls predictions at this point, 'kind of stupid.' Dixon also laments eroding transparency in the DeSantis administration and the frequency with which he's getting crickets when he requests information. If you're feeling a little shy about your coronavirus belly, don't worry, we share plenty of lamentations about our own belly flab. Listen here[2]. ___ Save the date\u2014 The education committee of the Florida Association of Professional Lobbyists is hosting an online seminar on 'COVID-19: Employer Responsibilities,' which will be geared toward best practices for FAPL members.

In a flurry of tweets, Trump mocked former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams's weight, ridiculed the looks of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and called former Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton a 'skank.' He revived long-debunked speculation that a television host with whom Trump has feuded may have killed a woman and asserted without evidence that mail-in voting routinely produces ballot stuffing. He made little mention of the sacrifice Americans honor on Memorial Day or the grim toll of the virus.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Trump-golfing-Memorial-day-Reuters.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Trump-golfing-Memorial-day-Reuters.jpg</url> In between bouts of rage tweeting, Donald Trump got in a little golf for Memorial Day. Image via Reuters. 'Could a second wave of coronavirus trigger new stay-at-home orders? States can't agree.[5]' via Nolan D. McCaskill and Dan Goldberg of POLITICO \u2014 Public health officials have been vocal about the risks of a second wave of COVID-19 as states reopen businesses and more people leave their homes. But unlike overseas, where several countries have moved quickly to reinstate lockdowns at the first sign of a case spike, few state or local governments have even established guidelines for when and how they would restrict activities to contain additional outbreaks. It's not immediately clear how many states are prepared to respond to a surge in cases brought on by reopening. Some state's reopening plans acknowledge the possibility of reversing course to protect people, while others don't mention the threat of additional outbreaks at all. 'Public remarks prompted Florida virus data curator's firing[6]' via Brendan Farrington and Bobby Caina Calvan of The Associated Press \u2014 The woman who raised questions about Florida's COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data's curator had been reprimanded several times and ultimately fired for violating Health Department policy by making public remarks about the information, state records show. State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information's accuracy as Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state's battered economy following safer-at-home orders.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theojt100.com\">https://theojt100.com</url> \u2014 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u2014 \u2014@RealDonaldTrump: I have zero interest in moving the Republican National Convention to Doral in Miami, as falsely reported by the Fake News @nytimes[7] in order to stir up trouble.

We focus too much on bad actors in Washington and around the country, but Americans have been tough and respectful of others during this crisis. #USA \u2014@AnnCoulter: COVID gave Trump a chance to be a decent, compassionate human being (or pretending to be). But he couldn't even do that. \u2014@Corybe: Imagine if the media had covered the mask story as fact (masks reduce R = fact) rather than a political story (Trump's not wearing one!) which introduces doubt and division. \u2014@NikkiFried: Voting is a right, not a privilege, @GovRonDeSantis. The voters, the courts, and the Constitution all agree. \u2014@NewsByAngel: Another day of frustrated Floridians surging my inboxes with pleas for help. Many say they've applied for @FLDEO benefits in March and still have not seen a dime. I'm continuing to send names/info to DEO and Governor's Office. \u2014@ChrisSprowls: Universities should not be allowed to hide their ties to the Chinese government or any foreign nation. Doing so risks our national security and our intellectual property. In Florida, we are demanding transparency. Every State government should follow suit. \u2014@CraigTimes: Every #MemorialDay my kids' Boy Scout troop goes out early in the morning to put flags on the graves of veterans.

Sampson of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 The counties around Tampa Bay have not reported new deaths from the novel coronavirus for two straight days. A holiday weekend, coupled with a steady thaw on pandemic closures, has offered a gasp of relief for Floridians \u2014 as epidemiologists warn residents to be vigilant, staying clear of big groups, sanitizing and wearing masks in public to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19. Florida's numbers will be closely watched over the coming days, both by people here and disease specialists nationwide. Monday marks three weeks since DeSantis' phased reopening began. Over the previous day, only Pinellas and Manatee added more than a dozen cases, at 14 and 13, respectively. Those two counties, which have each had serious outbreaks of the coronavirus in nursing homes.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pensacola-Beach-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pensacola-Beach-scaled.jpg</url> Pensacola Beach was packed for Memorial Day weekend. Image via AP.;; 'Fired scientist defends her COVID-19 data role, portrays Florida Dept. of Health as corrupt[9]' via Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon of Florida Today \u2014 While she specifically makes no implication that DeSantis was involved in efforts to massage or hide information on the state's COVID-19 dashboard, Rebekah Jones paints a picture of senior FDOH officials overly eager to appease the governor and his plans to reopen the state. In an email last week, Jones said she was removed from the helm of the state's COVID-19 dashboard as of May 5, because of her commitment to 'accessibility and transparency.' Jones further alleged that she was fired for refusing to 'manually change data' to favor the reopening plan. She also defended herself against what she called DeSantis' 'shocking and salacious attempt at character assassination' which she said felt like 'a cheap political move to avoid discussing the real story here, which is how the COVID-19 data is now being manipulated.' 'DeSantis' 'whack-a-mole' approach fails the frail in nursing homes[10]' via John Pacenti and Holly Baltz of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 DeSantis' 'whack-a-mole' approach to long-term care facilities in the pandemic \u2014 as the AARP calls it \u2014 has failed. Despite the proclamations, DeSantis didn't promptly identify outbreaks in elder care facilities and is now scrambling to stem the tide of cases and deaths, a Palm Beach Post investigation has found. Florida National Guard strike teams dispatched by DeSantis last month to test at nursing homes proved to be nothing more than a flyswatter against a viral swarm. COVID-19 fatalities linked to eldercare centers comprise nearly half the deaths in Florida and the percentage rises every day. Yet nursing homes and ALF residents and staff comprise only 2 percent of the state's population. 'Democrat state Senator says DeSantis wants working-class 'exposed to the virus''[11] via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis, said Sen. Vic Torres, 'doesn't want' the unemployed 'to get benefits.' 'He wants you to get exposed to the virus. He wants you out there. He doesn't care what happens to you or your family,' argued the Orlando Democrat. Torres' comments about what the Governor calls a 'smart, safe, and step-by-step' reopening of the state were made on a Saturday afternoon call in support of the Joe Biden Presidential campaign. 'FDA investigates lab as tens of thousands of COVID-19 test results in Florida are questioned[12]' via Bailey Gallion and Jayne O'Donnell of USA Today \u2014 Federal regulators are investigating a Texas laboratory that a Florida hospital chain dropped last week because of delayed and unreliable COVID-19 test results. AdventHealth, which has 45 hospitals in nine states, terminated its Florida contract with MicroGen DX due to concerns about the validity of some of the 60,000 tests MicroGen had processed for the system because the lab left them at room temperature for days. AdventHealth said it is notifying about 25,000 patients who got unreliable or delayed results. It is advising them to seek medical care and retesting if they tested negative but have COVID symptoms. 'How COVID-19 is clouding government transparency[13]' via Jenna Bourne of WTSP \u2014 'A public record is any material made or received by a government agency that facilitates its official business Documents, texts, emails,' Florida First Amendment Foundation President Pamela Marsh said. 'We've found that government agencies are taking advantage of this crisis to take an exemption and sort of mold it the way they want it,' Marsh said. The pandemic has had a chilling effect on access to public information. 'It's slowed it down tremendously. Slowed it down to almost a standstill,' Marsh said. '[I'm] incredibly disappointed and scared, frankly.

His Grim Reaper Tour has garnered national notoriety. Uhlfelder was recently interviewed by Michael Kosta and appeared with Kosta for a segment of The Daily Show. Sequestered somewhere in New York, Kosta seemed bent on making fun of Floridians flaunting the coronavirus by flocking to the state's beaches.

Judge orders ICE to disclose data[17]' via Monique O. Madan of the Miami Herald \u2014 A Miami federal judge has ordered U.S. immigration officials to disclose whether the government's practice of transferring detainees from one facility to another has contributed to a worrying spike in coronavirus cases inside three South Florida detention centers. The order comes after COVID-19 cases at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broward County skyrocketed last week after dozens of detainees were transferred there from Miami-Dade. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the increase in cases came after 33 detainees were transferred from Krome to BTC on May 14.

Inspectors found a facility they deemed woefully unprepared to deal with the highly contagious respiratory virus. An employee that the facility knew tested positive for the virus was taking the temperatures of other staff members entering the facility while wearing no personal protective equipment. The inspectors' initial observation was cited in an emergency order by the state Friday night suspending the facility's license.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home1-salmos23.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/home1-salmos23.jpg</url> The Salmos 23 ALF in Hialeah was closed by the state after dozens of staff and residents tested positive for COVID-19. 'Keys nursing home didn't report 13 deaths, including 7 possibly from COVID-19, report says[19]' via David Goodhue of the Miami Herald \u2014 A Florida Keys nursing home that has become a cluster for novel coronavirus cases did not report the deaths of 13 people at the facility to the state Department of Health. The medical director of the facility told inspectors she did order COVID-19 tests for the seven people. It's not clear from the report if the tests were ever conducted. The report not only highlights the opaque nature of the communications between the facility's management and state health officials, as well as relatives of those living inside, it adds confusion over the official number of people who have contracted COVID-19, and died from it, in the Florida Keys. The official death count from the disease in the Keys is three people since early April. 'Masks mandatory: Miami-Dade beaches to reopen amid COVID-19, but with new rules[20]' via Martin Vassolo and Aaron Liebowitz of the Miami Herald \u2014 Face masks will be required to enter Miami-Dade County beaches when they reopen June 1 but not when visitors are in the water or maintaining social distance, according to a draft guide to reopen beaches circulated by the county. Sunbathing, walking and jogging will be allowed, as will the renting of beach concessions like lounge chairs and umbrellas. But no groups bigger than 10 people will be allowed to gather, and common areas like picnic tables and playgrounds will stay off-limits. Facial coverings will be required at beach restrooms and at concession stands, and access to restrooms will be limited to observe social distancing. 'Back to the beach: Lifeguards prepare for reopening after coronavirus closures[21]' via Linda Robertson of the Miami Herald \u2014 Lifeguards' essential duties won't change but they will expand to include enforcement of social distancing rules.

Water rescue protocol will stay the same \u2014 they can't wear masks while swimming \u2014 but they'll be more cautious about contact with a victim.

'Getting ripped, politically: City-county battle over gyms reopens old wounds[23]' via Steve Bousquet of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The politics of the pandemic have driven a new wedge between two old adversaries: Ft. Lauderdale and Broward County. The latest trouble erupted when the city gave the go-ahead for commercial gyms to reopen Monday subject to a series of 10 safeguards and in accordance with Ron DeSantis' full Phase I executive order. Then the county balked and said those gyms should remain closed, that the governor's executive order gave the county the power to override the city. The fight isn't so much about gyms as it is about intergovernmental animosity that has festered for decades between two crotchety old neighbors who just can't get along, to the detriment of civic progress.

The Walt Disney World location would be a one-stop-shop for games, practices, and housing for players, the league added. Should the plan come to pass, it would fulfill a policy goal of DeSantis, who has maintained during the period of economic and movement restrictions he put in place this spring that people are 'starved for content' in the sports realm.

Some have outgrown church parking lots, shifting to venues like the Lee Civic Center and Hendry-LaBelle rodeo arena to avoid traffic jams. Organizations report feeding two to 20 times more people than usual. Community Cooperative in Fort Myers served more than 800 households from mobile food pantries in April 2019. This April, it served more than 4,000. Midwest Food Bank went from handing out about 700,000 pounds of food a month to Southwest Florida agencies before the pandemic to nearly 2 million pounds in April. 'Socially distant Wings of Gold: How the Navy is honoring naval aviators during COVID-19[27]' via Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal \u2014 Seven people from the U.S. Navy's HT-18 squadron at NAS Whiting Field got their wings of gold last week in a socially distant ceremony with few attendees, a far cry from the pomp and circumstance that usually accompanies one of naval aviation's most time-honored traditions. The new aviators were 'winged' by either a spouse or a close friend in a short outdoor ceremony. The Wings of Gold ceremony at Whiting signals a naval aviator's official completion of basic helicopter training and their entrance into the 'unrestricted naval aviator' territory. 'Coronavirus in Leon County: 6-year-old tests positive[28]' via CD Davidson-Hiers of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 The county total now stands at 372 confirmed local cases. The child encountered someone else who is positive for COVID-19, which suggests others in her family could also have the virus. A 10-year-old girl and 12-year-old girl also have tested positive for the virus in Leon County, the state reports. Of the 40 cases Monday, more than half belonged to people younger than 25 years old. The state health department reported that more than 1,200 new tests had been administered locally, presumably within 24 hours.

'Our leases are expiring and the uncertainty of times going forward have contributed to this decision.' That, coupled with the governor's call for restrictions on restaurants and bars and the general uncertainty of keeping the venues viable long-term, led to the decision that, though hard, seemed right. Even now, bars must remain closed and eateries can operate at only 50% dine-in capacity.

The pandemic that first struck in major metropolises is now increasingly finding its front line in the country's rural areas; counties with acres of farmland, cramped meatpacking plants, out-of-the-way prisons, and few hospital beds. Rural counties now have some of the highest rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, topping even the hardest-hit New York City boroughs and signaling a new phase of the pandemic that could devastate still more of America's most vulnerable towns as states lift stay-at-home orders.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-testing-Kansas.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-testing-Kansas.jpg</url>Kansas National Guard members wait for cars during a lull in people seeking tests at a coronavirus testing site in Dodge City, Kansas.

The District on Sunday recorded five deaths and 144 new infections, just above the seven-day average of 141. The city had eyed May 29 as the date to gradually begin reopening following the mayor's lengthy stay-at-home order. The stay-at-home and business closure orders were scheduled to run through June 8. 'Doctors are tweeting about coronavirus to make facts go viral[32]' via Georgia Wells of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 Scientists are driven to participate on social media due to 'sheer frustration with seeing the misinformation that is going out there,' said Karen James, an independent researcher and an expert in how scientists use social media. Twitter Inc., which this week said it would start labeling misleading tweets about COVID-19, also says it aims to amplify medical voices on the platform. Twitter said it has verified hundreds of COVID-19 experts globally, including scientists and academics. Verifying users adds a blue checkmark to their profiles that confer status and indicates that the company has confirmed the user's credentials. 'Administration leaves testing responsibility to states in report to Congress[33]' via Amy Goldstein of The Washington Post \u2014 The Trump administration is pledging to buy 100 million swabs by the year's end and distribute them to states to help expand the nation's capacity to test for the novel coronavirus. The administration's report doubles down on the administration's stance that individual states, not the federal government, should bear primary responsibility for carrying out diagnostic tests to help curb the pandemic. The plan arrived as the nation's COVID-19 cases exceeded 1.6 million and deaths closed in on 100,000 \u2014 both the highest in the world.  'Study estimates 24 states still have uncontrolled coronavirus spread[34]' via Joel Achenbach, Rachel Weiner and Isaac Stanley-Becker of The Washington Post \u2014 The coronavirus may still be spreading at epidemic rates in 24 states, particularly in the South and Midwest. It is a snapshot of a transitional moment in the pandemic and captures the patchwork nature across the country of COVID-19. The model shows that in the majority of states, a second wave looms if people abandon efforts to mitigate the viral spread. The model shows potentially ominous scenarios if people move around as they did previously and do so without taking precautions. 'COVID-19 patients not infectious after 11 days[35]' via Yoolim Lee of Bloomberg \u2014 COVID-19 patients are no longer infectious after 11 days of getting sick even though some may still test positive, according to a new study. A positive test 'does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus,' a joint research paper said. The virus 'could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness.' The paper was based on a study of 73 patents in Singapore. The latest findings may have implications on the country's patient discharge policy. The discharge criteria is currently based on negative test results rather than infectiousness. 'White House goal on testing nursing homes unmet[36]' via Alan Suderman of The Associated Press \u2014 Nearly two weeks ago the White House urged governors to ensure that every nursing home resident and staff member be tested for the coronavirus within 14 days. It's not going to happen. Only a handful of states, including West Virginia and Rhode Island, have said they've already tested every nursing home resident. Some states aren't even bothering to try to meet the White House's request. Many states said the logistics, costs and workforce needs are too great to test all residents and staff in a two-week window. Some say they need another week or so, while others say they need much more time.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Birx.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Birx.jpeg</url> Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks with reporters about the coronavirus.

'U.S. to restrict travel From Brazil to stem coronavirus spread[37]' via Catherine Lucy of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 The White House imposed restrictions on travel from Brazil, a hot spot of the pandemic in the developing world. Under the new measures set for this week, foreign nationals who have been in Brazil within 14 days before trying to enter the U.S. would be banned, with some exceptions. The South American nation has the second-most confirmed COVID-19 cases after the U.S. Exemptions to the ban include lawful permanent residents of the U.S., foreign nationals who are married to a U.S. citizen and foreign nationals who are the parent or legal guardian of an underage U.S. citizen. 'One final viral infusion: Trump's move to block travel from Europe triggered chaos and a surge of passengers from the outbreak's center[38]' via Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey and Aaron C. Davis of The Washington Post \u2014 The Trump administration's response to the threat from Europe proved consequential to the majority of the more than 94,000 people who have died and the 1.6 million now infected in the United States. Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. However, the travel mayhem was triggered by many of the same problems that plagued the U.S. response to the pandemic from the outset: Early warnings were missed or ignored. Coordination was chaotic or nonexistent. Key agencies fumbled their assignments. Many travelers were left in limbo. 'The coronavirus is deadliest where Democrats live[39]' via Jennifer Medina and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times \u2014The devastation, in other words, has been disproportionately felt in blue America, which helps explain why people on opposing sides of a partisan divide that has intensified in the past two decades are thinking about the virus differently. Democrats are far more likely to live in counties where the virus has ravaged the community, while Republicans are more likely to live in counties that have been relatively unscathed by the illness, though they are paying an economic price. Counties won by Trump in 2016 have reported just 27 percent of the virus infections and 21 percent of the deaths. In some parts of red America, cities have been virtually unscathed and the sparsely populated outlying areas have been hardest hit. 'How a small Michigan company reopened, averting a coronavirus outbreak[40]' via Steven Mufson of The Washington Post \u2014 United Precision Products was deemed an essential business and so it stayed open in March when the rest of the state shut down. Then an employee contracted the coronavirus and ended up in a hospital's intensive care unit. When a second worker came down with virus symptoms, the company temporarily shut its doors for a week and hired a firm whose technicians came in hazmat suits and sanitized the entire place. Even papers on the desk of the vice president were sprayed and left with the edges curling upward. When the company reopened, testing commenced and positive workers were immediately sent home and told to contact their doctors immediately. 'As Trump pushes for reopenings, congregations choose safety over haste[41]' via Rick Rojas and Elizabeth Dias of The New York Times \u2014 For the most part, churches across the country have not yet thrown open their doors. Instead, as in so many sectors of American life that have been disrupted, religious communities are stepping gingerly toward the post-shutdown world. The coming days bring a significant test. Many houses of worship have laid the groundwork for returning, and expect to resume some form of in-person worshipping next week. The discourse has grown increasingly political. Conservative churches in states under stay-at-home orders have pushed back against restrictions on worship, and Trump weighed in on behalf of one of his key constituencies, threatening on Friday to try to overrule governors who refuse to allow houses of worship to open. \u2014 CORONA ECONOMICS \u2014 'For economy, worst of coronavirus shutdowns may be over[42]' via Harriet Torry and Josh Mitchell of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 Truckloads are growing again. Air travel and hotel bookings are up slightly. Mortgage applications are rising. And more people are applying to open new businesses. These are among some early signs the U.S. economy is, ever so slowly, creeping back to life. Current projections have the economy contracting by 6% to 7% this year and unemployment lingering in double-digit percentages for a while.

No, it probably won't spell the end of the office, as some pundits have posited.

'How Russia's coronavirus crisis got so bad[45]' via Michele A. Berdy of POLITICO \u2014 Many Russians ignored the increasingly stringent lockdown measures instituted in Moscow beginning March 25. They didn't practice social distancing, traveled all over the city, used services that were supposed to be closed, got together with friends, sniffed, sneezed, coughed and even spat in public. Vladimir Putin has been giving addresses to the nation almost every week promising a safe deliverance from COVID-19 and aid for those who need it, but he is leaving the day-to-day decisions to local leaders and has barely left his residence outside Moscow. Russia has pledged only about 2.8 percent of GDP to aid primarily small- and medium-sized businesses.

It's too early to say whether the heightened demand will continue, especially in the middle of an economic recession, or how much the cost of safety protocols will affect course revenue.

It's a game that is playing out in wildly different ways across the country, suggesting that a chaotic run-up to the 2020 season is ahead. Decisions rest not with athletic directors, but university presidents and their bosses \u2014 the governor of each state. None of the game's organizing bodies \u2014 the NCAA and big conferences \u2014 has the power to dictate a consistent outcome. No one wants to be responsible for stopping the season. 'Our romantic relationships are actually doing well during the pandemic, study finds[48]' via Lisa Bonos of The Washington Post \u2014 A recent poll found that most people in relationships are satisfied with them, despite the expected stresses that might come from, say, working from home together, losing a job, managing kids at home or preventing your family from getting the virus. About three-quarters of Americans with a romantic partner say their relationship has not fundamentally changed since the coronavirus outbreak. Argument frequency and sex lives have changed for the better, but only slightly. About half expect their relationship will emerge stronger \u2014 and hardly any think it'll be worse. Married partners are more likely than unmarried ones to say their relationship has not changed. Most say their relationship isn't adding to pandemic stress \u2014 but women are a little more affected than men.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-relationships.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/coronavirus-relationships.jpeg</url> Couples were confused about whether they could still meet up under Boris Johnson's new lockdown rules.

'Reopening[49] too soon: Lessons from the deadly second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic[50]' via Adriana Usero of The Washington Post \u2014 As coronavirus lockdowns loosen and some Americans flock to restaurants, beaches, and other outdoor spaces for Memorial Day weekend, the question of reopening too quickly is striking an eerily familiar tone. The global flu epidemic of 1918 remains the deadliest on record. The research sought an answer to a key question: Was social distancing effective in 1918 as a way of slowing the spread of the disease and saving lives? In fact, statewide orders making masks mandatory and shuttering nonessential businesses were widespread in 1918. But varying levels of enforcement combined with World War I created a variety of outcomes in 1918. That fall marked the disease's second and deadliest wave in the United States.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medicineassistancetool.org/en\">https://medicineassistancetool.org/en</url> \u2014 D.C.

The president has promoted hydroxychloroquine as treatment of COVID-19 while there is little evidence that the drug has been effective to treat or prevent the coronavirus. The study found a 34% increase in the risk of mortality and a 137% increase in the risk of serious heart arrhythmia for patients who were given hydroxychloroquine.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Donald-Trump.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Donald-Trump.jpeg</url> Donald Trump has finished his regimen of hydroxychloroquine to ward off COVID-19. 'Trump considers forming panel to review complaints of online bias[52]' via John D. McKinnon and Alex Leary of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 Trump is considering establishing a panel to review complaints of anticonservative bias on social media in a move that would likely draw pushback from technology companies and others. The plans are still under discussion but could include the establishment of a White House-created commission that would examine allegations of online bias and censorship. Facebook Inc., which also owns Instagram, defended its practices when asked for a response to the nascent proposal. Jon Berroya, interim president of the Internet Association, a trade group, disputed the contention that tech companies tilt left. Conservative groups in particular contend that big tech platforms engage in viewpoint bias in search rankings, news feeds, content moderation and other practices.  'Trump to attend Elon Musk's SpaceX launch in Florida[53]' via Gary Fineout and Anita Kumar of POLITICO Florida \u2014 Trump plans to travel to Kennedy Space Center in Florida Wednesday to witness the launch of the first Americans into space in nearly a decade. Two NASA astronauts will travel aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, owned by Musk, who leads SpaceX and co-founded the electric car company Tesla. The launch will mark the first time NASA will send astronauts into orbit aboard a spacecraft built by a private company.

'Debbie Mucarsel-Powell tests negative for COVID-19[55]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 Mucarsel-Powell says she has tested negative for the novel coronavirus after possible exposure at a nursing home in the Keys. Mucarsel-Powell traveled to the Crystal Health and Rehab Center. That trip came after family members of residents expressed concern to Mucarsel-Powell that they were not notified of positive tests at that facility. Mucarsel-Powell says she went inside the facility during the visit, with permission of the facility director. Mucarsel-Powell says she was wearing a mask at the time. She announced she would enter self-quarantine as a precautionary measure. The Congresswoman argues the incident shows the need to make safety at these facilities a higher priority.

Republican lawmakers and DeSantispushed the measure after Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to expand voting rights to felons who have completed 'all terms of their sentence including probation and parole.' The law's backers said it was necessary to clarify the amendment, while critics said Republicans were trying to limit the effects of a large expansion of the state's electorate.

When voters in 2018 approved Amendment 4, which restored the right to vote to nonviolent felons who had completed their sentences. And the legal battle over the Legislature's actions have become arguably the premier voting rights case in the nation. 1. It was big. But we don't know yet how big. 2. Large groups of felons should now be eligible to vote. 3. It could affect how other states handle felon voting. 4.

'What happens if a hurricane hits during the pandemic[61]?' via Patricia Mazzei of The New York Times \u2014 A mild storm might not require many evacuations. People with newer homes built to withstand strong winds could be safer sheltering in place than leaving their homes. After a storm leaves, new concerns could emerge. Amid the economic crisis, more people could need meals, perhaps for a week or more. And electricity would likely take longer to restore because utility crews would be working under unusual conditions. If a big storm comes this summer, people in harm's way may hear somewhat contradictory and perhaps confusing orders: Stay at home and remain socially distant from others to avoid contracting the coronavirus. But leave home, even if that means coming into closer contact with other people, to be safe during a dangerous hurricane. 'Hurricane sales tax holiday could boost coronavirus-stricken businesses[62]' via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics \u2014 Florida's hurricane sales tax holiday begins Friday and it couldn't come soon enough for businesses desperate to boost their revenue. This year's tax holiday runs through June 4 and exempts sales tax on qualifying hurricane supplies. The holiday comes as many businesses are just reopening their doors after weeks of closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic that has crippled the economy. 'These are unprecedented times,' said Edie Ousley, vice president of public affairs for the Florida Chamber of Commerce. 'Florida has for several years had this sales tax holiday, but I'm certain when lawmakers were finalizing the sales tax holiday for this year, they didn't have a pandemic on their mind. Nonetheless, it's really important for Floridians to prepare.' 'Stifled by online learning during COVID-19, some Manatee parents want their kids held back[63]' via Giuseppe Sabella of the Bradenton Herald \u2014 Testing requirements and school grades were canceled for the 2019-2020 school year, and while students would be advanced to the next grade, it was ultimately the parents' decision, DeSantis said on March 17. 'Parents may, at their discretion, decide to keep their child in the same grade for the 20-21 school year,' he said at the time. Many parents have started this process of having their children held back and repeat the school year that was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.  'Bay District Schools announces preliminary plans for returning to school[64]' via Faith Graham of MyPanhandle.com \u2014 Bay District Schools has announced their preliminary plans for returning to school for the 2020-2021 academic year.

A change in venue so late in the process would be difficult.

Democrats see a constitutional crisis in the making.[73]' via David Siders of POLITICO \u2014 Trump threatened to withhold federal funding because of his assertion that both states were preparing to commit voter fraud through mail-in ballot applications. Then, Trump followed up Sunday with two more broadly-worded warnings that November would be 'the greatest Rigged Election in history.' Trump's increasingly amped-up rhetoric surrounding the integrity of the November election is beginning to bring to center stage a previously muted conversation. His opponents are becoming increasingly anxious that Trump may attempt to undermine the results of the election if he loses \u2014 or worse, might attempt to cling to power regardless of the outcome. The idea itself isn't new. Dating back even before his entry into electoral politics, the president has had a long preoccupation with voter fraud and 'rigged' elections. 'Trump sows doubt on voting. It keeps some people up at night.[74]' via Reid J. Epstein of The New York Times \u2014 Anxiety has intensified in recent weeks as the president continues to attack the integrity of mail voting and insinuate that the election system is rigged, while his Republican allies ramp up efforts to control who can vote and how. Joe Biden, for his part, has suggested more than once that Trump might try to disrupt or delay the election. A recent comment by the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner about whether the election would be held as scheduled renewed fears that Trump would try to move the election, or discredit the balloting process, if he thought he was going to lose. 'The pandemic has already altered how tens of millions of Americans can cast their ballots this year[75]' via Elise Viebeck of The Washington Post \u2014 In a watershed moment for American voting, nearly 30 states have changed rules or practices for this year's primaries or the general election in response to the public health threat posed by COVID-19. The new policies affect roughly 86.6 million registered voters.

'#8216;Always an afterthought.' Strategists question Joe Biden strategy to win Florida Latinos[76]' via Bianca Padr\u00f3 Ocasio and David Smiley of the Miami Herald \u2014 Biden's campaign this week hired a national senior Latino adviser, began to sharply attack Trump over the state's Latino unemployment rate and moved to host regular Spanish-language virtual chats with Florida allies. Activists still worry that Biden has done too little with Hispanic voters to take back Florida from Trump. Democrats widely blamed narrow losses in races for Governor and U.S. Senate on poor Hispanic outreach.

How intertwined and interconnected our economy is, how provisional, how this thing depended on that. But the biggest things I suspect we learned were internal. No matter what you do for a living, when you weren't busy introspection knocked on the door and settled in. \u2014 OPINIONS \u2014 'America's[88] seniors, sacrificed on the altar of reopening[89]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post \u2014 For frail seniors in the United States, there simply is no haven. The unspoken, if inherent, trade-off in reopening the economy without safeguards is the lives of our elders. With flawed tests yielding false negatives of 12 percent to 40 percent, even facilities trying hardest can't reliably fight the virus. The lack of protective equipment is also glaring. Virtually all facilities are reusing single-use equipment. Seniors are well aware that the current administration has essentially offered them up as sacrifices on the altar of economic recovery. By opening up commerce without a haven for our seniors, the Trump administration and its gubernatorial mimics have failed America's moral test utterly. 'There is one ingredient essential to reopening the economy, and still no federal plan to get it[90]' via The Washington Post editorial board \u2014 Diagnostic testing will be critical to our ability to manage lives, jobs, schools and health if there are delays in a vaccine's development and distribution. Yet we still lack a federal strategy to get there. Diagnostic testing is important, absent a vaccine or therapy, as part of a concerted effort to identify the sick, isolate and treat them, and allow everyone else to get back to business. Right now, testing is the foundation of state decisions about reopening, yet the testing landscape is disorderly and inadequate. Another worrisome question mark is testing accuracy. Quick tests are still producing too many false-negative results. 'How to safely reopen 'closed communities' such as Florida's universities[91]' via Dr. William Greenough of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 As Florida begins to reopen and the state universities plan to welcome students back to campus in the fall, we can use a less disruptive and more effective measure that has two prongs: quick tests to identify who has the coronavirus and \u2014 this is key \u2014 then rely on members of a community to locate those who might have had contact with the ones who test positive. This process can work in relatively closed communities such as universities that are less at risk. The first basic step is to promptly identify the earliest cases in any community. Then comes the hard part: Anyone who tests positive must be strictly quarantined for two to three weeks. 'Believing that firing of COVID-19 data manager is a 'nonissue' just got a lot harder[92]' via the Florida Today editorial board \u2014 DeSantis' explanation that the firing of Jones from the Florida Department of Health is a 'nonissue,' and that she is an underqualified disgruntled employee of questionable character, just got a lot harder to believe. Jones said she deserves an investigation into what she described as efforts by DOH leadership to manipulate data to help the governor's reopening plans. Jones gave enough cover for the governor to do the right thing: She wrote in a statement on her website, that she 'never stated nor implied that the Governor was involved with asking me to manipulate, delete and hide data.' 'Is Wall Street Journal right? Is Florida' well-managed?' It depends[93]' via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board \u2014 The Wall Street Journal's editorial page assailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this week for seeking more federal aid to cope with the coronavirus. If the sole criterion for good management is low taxes, as the Journal's seems to be, then Florida qualifies. But not if the standard is defined as serving and protecting the public. The multitudes of laid-off workers who couldn't get through to Florida's CONNECT unemployment compensation system would hardly rate Florida as favorably as the Journal does. Neither would the motorists driven to despair by the SunPass toll-collection debacle. 'Florida's[94] state education officials have made civic literacy a joke[95]' via Bob Holladay of Florida Phoenix \u2014 Members of Florida's State Board of Education, appointed positions that do not really require any expertise in education, amply demonstrated on the morning of May 13 when, with nary a question or a comment, they approved a controversial new rule about civic literacy requirements. Generally students are now required to 'demonstrate competency in civic literacy,' under legislation passed by the Florida Legislature in 2017. Civic literacy means an understanding of history and how government works, and people my age are worried that people their age, who are going to run the country sooner instead of later, will be even worse at it than we are.        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flchamber.com\">https://www.flchamber.com</url> \u2014 TODAY'S SUNRISE \u2014 Florida has entered uncharted territory, according to the latest stats from the U.S. Department of Labor. The Sunshine State now has an unemployment rate of 12.9% \u2014 the highest since they started the current counting system back in the 1970s. There are at least 1,218,000 jobless Floridians; more than any time in state history. DeSantis reacts to those numbers, as Sunrise does another deep dive on Florida's unemployment mess. Also, on today's Sunrise: \u2014 DeSantis isn't letting those jobless numbers dampen his enthusiasm for reopening the state. He's saying it's OK to send kids off to summer camp (as well as other outdoor activities) to get them out of the house and back into social circles. \u2014 The Tallahassee woman who was fired by the health department after going public with her concerns about manipulating COVID-19 data does her first interview since DeSantis threw her under the bus. Although the Governor said she was fired for insubordination, Jones told CNN she was canned for refusing to change the stats to match his desire to reopen smaller counties that didn't meet the guidelines for reopening \u2014 The DeSantis administration loses another legal battle over the voting rights of former felons. A federal judge says the state cannot demand payment from ex-cons to get their voting rights restored if they don't have the money. And he's not just talking about restitution. The judge says court fines and fees are a tax and as such cannot be a precondition to the restoration of voting rights. \u2014 Checking in with a Florida Man arrested for trying to go home.

Only one venue, however, actually required patrons to arrive in an automobile: the drive-in movie theater, whose enormous screens and overflowing parking lots used to be as ubiquitous as the golden arches of McDonald's. During the pandemic, however, Americans are giving drive-ins a fresh look. The doors of multiplexes and art houses are shut, but drive-ins in all but a handful of states have been given the all-clear to start running movies again. '#8216;Tenet'[98] trailer gives glimpse of Christopher Nolan's mysterious new film[99]' via Lisa Respers France of CNN Entertainment \u2014 A new trailer for 'Tenet' has debuted in Fortnite. It's the latest Hollywood collaboration for the game and has helped further stoke excitement for the film, directed by Nolan. Starring John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the movie remains largely a mystery since there are scant details in the trailer beyond a hint of a plot that involves espionage and time warping. One other thing not featured in the trailer? The release date.

The team, the Class AA affiliate of the Minnesota Twins that plays in the Southern League, listed Blue Wahoos Stadium on Airbnb, starting at $1,500 a night (plus fees). Up to 10 guests can stay at the stadium, with four bunk beds and a pair of queen-sized beds available in rooms adjacent to the clubhouse. Visitors will have full access to the stadium, including the batting cages. Per the listing, 'guests are welcome to hit from home plate, play catch in the outfield, run the bases, enjoy a picnic in the outfield, or find other creative uses for the field!' \u2014 HAPPY BIRTHDAY \u2014 Celebrating today are the great Marian Johnson of The Florida Chamber of Commerce, as well as Florida Politics contributor Mark Bergin, Jason Harrell, Mike Fischer (it's his real birthday), Dan Krassner, and Dr. Jason Wilson. Happy birthday belatedly to Rob Johnson of The Mayernick Group and Ashley Ross of Rubin Turnbull &amp;#38; Associates. ___ Sunburn is authored and assembled by Peter Schorsch, Phil Ammann, A.G.

Today, he officially filed for Senate District 20. 'For nearly two years I've had the honor to serve our state's veterans and work on behalf of those who answered the call to serve in the United States Armed Forces,' Burgess said. 'Their bravery, commitment to others, and selflessness inspires me each and every day and I will always champion their cause should I be honored to serve in the state Senate.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/burgess-2-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/burgess-2-scaled.jpg</url> Danny Burgess is stepping down from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to mount a run for the Senate. 'I'm excited to start communicating our results-oriented and community-centered message to every corner of Senate District 20 and I look forward to the campaign ahead.' The cornerstone of that message: 'renewing Florida's economic promise and taking care of the most vulnerable among us.' For a candidate that just days ago wasn't expected to be on the ballot, it couldn't be going better. The Pasco native was already a formidable contender, considering his former District 38 seat in the Florida House overlaps with SD 20. Add in legislative and executive experience and Shortly after Thonotosassa Republican Sen. Tom Lee announced he would exit the Legislature midway through his term, Burgess landed endorsements from Senate President-designate Wilton Simpson and Majority Leader Kathleen Passidomo. His pathway was made clearer when Rep. Jamie Grant said he would defer to Burgess if he wanted the seat. As yet, there are no other contenders for the seat \u2014 the Governor only called for a special election hours before Burgess made it official \u2014 but that could change quickly. Others rumored to be up for the job include former Sen. Dana Young, Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White Pasco County Commissioner Mike Moore and Plant City Mayor Rick Lott. ___ First on #FlaPol \u2014Gov. Ron DeSantis has extended the eviction moratorium until July 1. That ban on evictions and foreclosures was set to expire midnight Monday. But DeSantis has granted an additional 30 days, according to spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferr. Last week, the Governor said he had not decided whether to extend the protections for homeowners and renters but expected to make a decision 'pretty soon.' Democrats have repeatedly asked for the extension throughout the pandemic as the economic reality of a lockdown hit Floridians. Technical problems plaguing the state's unemployment system portal have compounded those hardships. And for those who still haven't been fully paid what they're owed, getting on the phone with a customer service representative has been a continuing problem[1]. That's left many Floridians unable to pay the bills. But as landlords lose income, they too must figure out how to pay the bills. Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson's office on Wednesday sent the Governor a letter calling for the moratorium to be extended until July 1[2], 30 days from the June 2 end date. ___ First in #FlaPol \u2014 'Charlie Crist taps former Pete Buttigieg state director as campaign manager[3]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics \u2014 St. Petersburg Democratic Rep. Crist is hiring Sydney Throop as his 2020 campaign manager. Throop previously served as the state director for presidential candidate Mayor Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. She also worked as the field director for a Massachusetts Secretary of State campaign and served with the Reason to Believe PAC in Iowa. Throop said she is excited to 'keep the House blue' and 'elect Democrats up and down the ballot.' Crist and Throop will work to maintain the Democratic stronghold of the congressional district 13 in November.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Throop-flag-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Throop-flag-1.jpg</url> Congratulations to Sydney Throop, the former Pete Buttigieg state director who has joined the Charlie Crist reelection campaign.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/flhospitalassociation/;\">https://www.instagram.com/flhospitalassociation/;</url> \u2014 AMERICA IN CRISIS \u2014 'Donald Trump declares he's President of law, order amid protests[4]' via The Associated Press \u2014 Trump declared himself 'the President of law and order' and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split-screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers to keep the peace if Governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Donald-Trump-Law-and-order.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Donald-Trump-Law-and-order.jpg</url> With flash bombs in the distance, Donald Trump calls himself the 'law and order' President. Image via AP. 'Family-commissioned autopsy says George Floyd's death was homicide[5]' via Axios \u2014 Preliminary results from an independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family found that his death in the custody of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was 'homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,' according to a statement from the family's attorney. The autopsy contradicts preliminary findings from the Hennepin County medical examiner, who found 'no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation,' according to charging documents against Chauvin. The official examination is still ongoing. 'Trump calls protesters 'terrorists' and urges Governors to seek 'retribution'[6]' via Jonathan Martin, Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times \u2014 Trump lashed out at Governors for their response to the violence roiling the country, calling protesters 'terrorists,' demanding 'retribution' and warning the Governors they would look like 'jerks' if they did not send them to 'jail for long periods of time.' 'You have to dominate,' Trump told the Governors. If they failed to take a strong hand, he said, the protesters were 'going to run over you, you're going to look like a bunch of jerks.' The tirade, delivered on a private conference call, showed the depth of Trump's anger over protests and riots. 'Trump suggests the kind of 'vicious' response to protests he once hailed from China in Tiananmen Square[7]' via Aaron Blake of The Washington Post \u2014 After days of no public remarks about the unrest across the country, Trump offered a glimpse of his vision for dealing with the protesters, rioters and looters: Law enforcement needs to 'dominate.' Trump offered this prescription on a call with Governors that also included urging 10-year prison terms for those apprehended and seemed to suggest that he may have the military take over. It was a bold proposal from Trump. But it's also wholly predictable that Trump would go down this road, given his past comments about such demonstrations. 'Waiting for Trump to speak, and bracing for whether his words will make matters worse[8]' via Eugene Scott of The Washington Post \u2014 To get the best sense of what Trump is really focused on and concerned with regarding the uprisings that are occupying the nation, one should turn to his preferred, unfiltered method of communication: Twitter. The president has mostly used social media platform to attack his Democratic rivals and the media, to defend police and to promise a tough stance against those who break laws in their protests. Conservative media hosts have called on the president to deliver remarks aimed at unifying the nation. 'AG William Barr deploying federal riot teams to D.C., Miami to quell unrest, DOJ official says[9]' via Kevin Johnson, Bart Jansen and Kristine Phillips of the USA Today \u2014 Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Riot teams are being sent from the federal Bureau of Prisons, while the FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C. A weekend of rioting in the nation's capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people were arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers, including Secret Service agents, were injured. 'Facing protests over use of force, police respond with more force[10]' via Shaila Dewan and Mike Baker of The New York Times \u2014 Demonstrations continued across the United States on Sunday as the nation braced for another grueling night of unrest over police shootings. Videos showed police officers in recent nights using batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked. Trump resisted calls to address the tensions roiling the country. Instead, he used Twitter to criticize local Democratic leaders for not doing more to control the protests. Military vehicles in recent nights have moved down city streets as phalanxes of officers in full riot gear fired clouds of noxious gas. 'Matt Gaetz seriously asks: Can we 'hunt' antifa 'terrorists' like we do 'in the Middle East?'[11]' via Pilar Melendez of The Daily Beast \u2014 'Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?' the Republican lawmaker said. Gaetz's violent rhetoric comes hours after Sen. Tom Cotton urged Trump to deploy active-duty military personnel to cities in the wake of nationwide protests over the killing of Floyd. On Sunday, Trump claimed that the U.S. government will designate 'antifa' as a terrorist organization after the President blamed them for riots across the country. 'Anarchy, rioting, and looting needs to end tonight,' Cotton said, adding, 'if local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let's see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they're facing off with the 101st Airborne Division.' \u2014'Twitter adds warning label to Gaetz tweet on antifa for glorifying violence[12]' via Cristiano Lima of POLITICO      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/matt-gaetz.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/matt-gaetz.jpg</url> A Matt Gaetz tweet suggests we hunt down antifa like Middle Eastern terrorists; he gets slapped with a warning label for 'glorifying violence.' 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz ridicules Trump response to George Floyd protests: 'He tucks his tail between his legs, hides in a bunker'[13]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Wasserman Schultz tore into Trump for what she described as his hapless response to the protests sparked by the killing of Floyd. 'Where is the president? Where is the president of the United States using the platform that he has to heal the country and bring us together?' she asked during a video news conference. Trump should have addressed the nation to 'acknowledge the hurt and the hundreds of years of racial injustice and pain that exists. But instead, he tucks his tail between his legs, hides in a bunker and allows Rome to burn around him,' Wasserman Schultz said. 'National Guard troop levels reach historic high amid pandemic and protest[14]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics \u2014 Amid rising civil unrest and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, troop numbers for the National Guard are at historic highs. 'As a uniformed member of America's military, it breaks my heart to see the country I love in such pain,' said Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel. As of Monday, 66,722 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard were mobilized in 23 states and the District of Columbia in response to protests, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Guard Bureau said personnel assigned to deal with the unrest are trained and equipped to support law enforcement and first responders. '#8216;The norms have broken down': Shock as journalists are arrested, injured by police while trying to cover the story[15]' via Paul Farhi and Elahe Izadi of The Washington Post \u2014 At least a dozen journalists injured in cities across America this weekend including a photographer who was blinded in one eye as police fired rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas to quell unrest. In several cases, reporters appear to have been swept up in indiscriminate efforts by authorities to disperse crowds. But in a number of incidents, journalists were injured, harassed or arrested even after identifying themselves as reporters. 'A wave of protests puts a spotlight on U.S. hypocrisy[16]' via Ishaan Tharoor of The Washington Post \u2014 Trump may be uniquely bad at bringing a wounded, divided country together. Throughout six consecutive days of unrest in cities across the country, Trump pledged military retribution on protesters engaged in unlawful acts, dismissed their outrage as the work of leftist troublemakers, and said nothing of reports of heavy-handed police actions during the demonstrations. The United States has already scaled back its defense of human rights and the rule of law in other parts of the world. Now the events of the past week have unfurled like the kind of catalog of abuses you'd see documented by U.S.-based rights groups in countries elsewhere. 'Andrew Cuomo says protests should spark U.S. ban on excessive force[17]' via Bloomberg \u2014 Protests across the U.S. over the death of Floyd should spark a national ban on excessive force by police officers, Cuomo said. The Democratic Governor said he will be talking to Mayor Bill de Blasio about a potential curfew in New York City, where there were reports of looting and some 'disturbing' videos of police encounters with the crowds. Violent activity by protesters 'obscures the righteousness of the message,' Cuomo said at a press briefing. 'It plays into the hands of people and forces who don't want to make changes.' de Blasio said a curfew is an option but is not planned. Over the weekend, the mayor said police who drove into a crowd of demonstrators were wrong, but that the protesters had created conditions for the incident. 'Louisville police chief fired in aftermath of fatal shooting[18]' via Bruce Schreiner and Sophia Tulp of The Associated Press \u2014 Louisville's police chief was fired after the mayor learned that officers involved in a shooting that killed the popular owner of a barbecue spot failed to activate body cameras during the chaotic scene.David McAtee, known for offering meals to police officers, died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. The U.S. attorney said federal authorities will join state police in investigating the fatal shooting. 'Music industry calls for blackout Tuesday amid unrest[19]' via Mesfin Fekadu of The Associated Press \u2014 Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd's death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. On Tuesday, June 2, Columbia Records will observe 'Black Out Tuesday,'' the Sony label home to Beyonc, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. 'This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce.jpeg</url> Musicians including Rihanna, Jay-Z, Beyonc, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following George Floyd's death and the worldwide riots. Image via AP. 'Retailers and restaurants across the U.S. close their doors amid protests[20]' via Rachel Lerman and Todd C. Frankel of The Washington Post \u2014 Retailers and other businesses in cities across the U.S., including the Bay Area, the District of Columbia, New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Minneapolis, experienced broken windows, thefts and other violence over the weekend. The actions prompted a number of businesses to shut their doors and raised questions about how exactly the actions relate to the protesters, many of whom were peaceful. Walmart on Sunday closed several hundred stores due to potential protests. Amazon said it had adjusted routes or scaled back delivery operations in some cities, while Apple closed an unspecified number of stores on Sunday. 'Read the email Tim Cook sent to Apple employees about Floyd[21]' via Annie Palmer of CNBC \u2014 In the memo, Cook condemned the killing and called for the creation of a 'better, more just world for everyone.' 'We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor and life,' Cook said. Cook also acknowledged that racial injustice exists in the U.S., including in 'our criminal justice system' and 'in the disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities,' as well as from economic inequality and disparities in educational opportunities. 'Corporate voices get behind 'black lives matter' cause[22]' via Tiffany Hsu of The New York Times \u2014 Major companies are often wary of conflict, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. After Floyd died in Minneapolis, a wide range of companies began to take much more public stances on racial injustice and police violence. Speaking out on social issues is often a calculated decision, a form of 'values and identity-driven targeted marketing,' said Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Some companies were more cautious in their approach. 'Record ratings and record chaos on cable news[23]' via Ben Smith of The New York Times \u2014 The power, and the stress, are clearest at Fox News, by far the most-watched American news channel but one that has been in a rolling corporate crisis since its founder, Roger Ailes, was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations almost four years ago. MSNBC has been scrambling in a different way. The channel thrived from 2017 until earlier this year, lifted by its nonstop coverage of the Trump-Russia story and the story's denouement in impeachment. CNN once positioned itself between MSNBC and Fox on the political spectrum. The network has since adopted an increasingly political focus, hosting dozens of Democratic primary town halls and debates since Trump seeks to confront the media. 'Pepper spray sales soar on Amazon[24]' via Spencer Soper of Bloomberg \u2014 Amazon.com Inc. shoppers are buying up pepper spray as demonstrations continue around the country and self-defense becomes top-of-mind for some Americans. People are swapping recommendations for self-defense products on social media platforms like Twitter, where users are posting links to Sabre pepper spray on Amazon. Protests have rocked U.S. cities since the killing in police custody of Floyd. Amazon became a pipeline for household essentials such as toilet paper and disinfecting wipes for shoppers hunkered down at home to avoid contracting COVID-19. The spike in pepper spray sales shows how protests around the country are influencing consumer demand. \u2014 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u2014 \u2014@morningmoneyben: Sometimes you think, 'how could this year get any worse?' And then it always, always does. There's just no bottom. \u2014@MarcoRubio: Many in the media fell for the calculated &amp;#38; deliberate tactics of professional agitators. They knew the street needed to be cleared before 7 p.m . curfew. But they deliberately stayed to trigger police action &amp;#38; get the story they wanted, that 'police attacked peaceful protesters.' \u2014@TomCottonAR: Anarchy, rioting, and looting needs to end tonight. If local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let's see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they're facing off with the 101st Airborne Division. We need to have zero tolerance for this destruction. \u2014@MattGaetz: Now that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East? \u2014@ChrisLHayes: I think a lot of Americans really don't know how much the American Revolution was precipitated by the Crown's abuse of the policing power against the colonists. It was *central* and often led to unrest, riots, tarring and feathering and the like. Tweet, tweet:\u2014@AndrewFeinberg: Wow. As @realDonaldTrump prepares to speak, mounted *federal* police are throwing flashbang grenades at peaceful protesters as military police (and perhaps Bill Barr) look on. Clearly timed for the President's remarks. \u2014@SteveHelling: Make no mistake: when President Trump mentioned our Second Amendment rights in his speech, he was signaling that citizens can and should shoot the protesters. \u2014@PeterBakerNYT: Trump leaves the impression that he wanted exactly this split-screen moment where he talked tough at the very moment troops and police moved against peaceful protesters outside the executive mansion. \u2014@MacStipanovich: Betas who wave AR-15s. I have known very few genuinely tough men who talked about how tough they are. In fact, I cannot remember one. I have known men for years without knowing they had Silver Stars. My guess is you would wear a fire watch ribbon on your lapel. \u2014@AGAshleyMoody: The killing of George Floyd was criminal and I stand with the law enforcement community in condemning it. However, I am absolutely heartbroken and appalled by the riots and looting that has ravaged our state. Destroying small businesses and attacking officers isn't the answer. \u2014@Andrew4Duval: You can't be shocked that the Government you wanted to force people to stay inside for months, shut down businesses, and borrow trillions of dollars with ease is big enough to mobilize personnel and quell any violent protesting. \u2014@CFernandezFL: Members of my family fled an oppressive regime in Cuba because their government used military force to silence people who peacefully assembled in dissent. We just saw the exact same thing happen in the United States of America. All so the President can have a photo op. \u2014@NateMonroeTU: TFW you wake up and realize you're furloughed.

'Florida has zero-tolerance for violence, rioting and looting,' DeSantis said in a prepared statement. 'George Floyd's murder was appalling, and the Minnesota perpetrators need to be brought to justice, but this cannot be used as a pretext for violence in our Florida communities.' DeSantis remained quiet even as the sometimes violent protests roiled the country, including parts of Florida. On Sunday, the Governor's spokesperson told Florida Politics that the Governor had activated nearly 700 members of the Florida National Guard on Saturday. \u2014'As violence spreads, DeSantis is silent[26]' via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DeSantis.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DeSantis.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis has not said much about the days of violent protests, even when there was one outside the Governor's Mansion.

In a letter addressed to House Speaker Jos Oliva and Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls, Fried described Sabatini's tweet as reckless and a violation of House rules. 'By encouraging armed violence against protesters, Rep.

'Peaceful protests are appropriate, but 'violent riots must stop,' warns Senate President[28]' via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014 Florida Senate President Bill Galvano weighed in on the death of Minneapolis resident Floyd, killed last week by police. Streets around the country have been rocked by violence and wanton property destruction since. While he backed the peaceful protests, Galvano had a warning for rioters filling streets in Florida and presumably elsewhere. 'Violent riots must stop. I support the efforts of law enforcement and National Guard troops who are working to protect the safety of people and property.' 'Florida Police Chiefs Association condemns officers for role in Floyd's death[29]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics \u2014 The Florida Police Chiefs Association joined the calls denouncing a Minneapolis police officer's role in the death of Floyd. Chief Kenneth Albano, president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association, said the events last week need a 'clear and unified message.' 'The Florida Police Chiefs Association condemns the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, and we call for the speedy and impartial trial of Officer Chauvin on this charge,' he said. He also announced the creation of a subcommittee of chiefs and community leaders to submit solutions to the Florida Legislature.

'With the help of law-abiding citizens and the hard work of law enforcement, Sheriff Williams and I have decided to rescind the curfew tonight,' Curry said in an announcement posted on Twitter. 'We have the capacity should the need arise, but we very much appreciate the cooperation of the people of our city.'

The GoFundMe page was set up Saturday night for the Jacksonville Community Action Committee 'to provide community support for those who've had their civil liberties deprived by local law enforcement.' The committee was involved in organizing people who gathered Saturday to protest abuse of force by members of law enforcement, including the killing of Floyd last month in Minnesota. It originally aimed to raise $40,000 in aid. 'Miami chief, Mayor deride arrested protesters as 'outsiders.' But 30 of 57 are from county[32]' via Monique O. Madan, Joey Flechas and David Smiley of the Miami Herald \u2014 The morning after peaceful protests morphed into violent demonstrations in downtown Miami, local officials told the public that most of the 'agitators' were 'outsiders.' 'Of the 57 people that were arrested, 13 of those 57 live in the City of Miami. OK? So, we have Minnesota, New York. Georgia. People from outside of the county [who] were arrested,' said Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina. Juan Diasgranados, a spokesman for the corrections department, said only seven of the 57 people arrested are known to have addresses from out of state.

The march, organized by the Kissimmee and St. Cloud police departments, began at the Kissimmee Civic Center and wove through downtown to KPD headquarters. It has been peaceful, though some area businesses braced for the worst, boarding up windows.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kissimmee-protesters.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kissimmee-protesters.jpg</url> Peaceful protests have continued throughout Central Florida. Image via WFTV. 'Much of South Florida is under curfew for a week[34]' via Lisa J. Huriash, Karina Elwood and Angie DiMichele of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Much of South Florida will be on lockdown at night this week to stem civil protests that have grown violent, potentially endangering the public. A seven-day curfew began Sunday in Broward County, mandating that residents stay indoors from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and that businesses close up shop. Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry imposed the curfew in response to 'growing civil unrest.' Fort Lauderdale issued a 72-hour curfew on Sunday and threatened to arrest violators. In Miami-Dade, a seven-day curfew was put into effect Saturday night, but it was extended Sunday until further notice. 'Prosecutor fired over Facebook post calling demonstrators 'animals'[35]' via Rafael Olmeda of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 A Broward prosecutor who likened protesters to zoo animals in a Facebook post was fired. Amy Bloom, an eight-year veteran of the Broward State Attorney's Office, referred to protesters as 'animals at the zoo' and called their acts shameful. Bloom quickly deleted the post, but not before someone captured an image of it and began sharing it with other Broward lawyers. 'When will people learn that their criminal acts and obnoxious protesting actually gets you nowhere?' she wrote. 'Act civilized and maybe things will change. I've never seen such animals except at the zoo.' She added that her criticisms apply to everyone regardless of race. 'Some county commissioners support curfew, but PBSO does not[36]' via Hannah Morse of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 A Palm Beach County commissioner proposed a countywide curfew after reports of vandalism followed a peaceful protest that called for justice in Floyd's death. Yet Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw won't support a countywide curfew, said PBSO spokeswoman Teri Barbera, because he does not think it's necessary. Instead, more law-enforcement officers will be out on patrol to dissuade potential vandals, Barbera noted. 'West Palm mayor, police chief details protest response; some fault tactics[37]' via Olivia Hitchcock of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 Of the estimated 3,000 people who protested peacefully Sunday afternoon in West Palm Beach, fewer than 100 'agitators' were to blame for the violence that unfolded that night downtown, city police said during a news conference. Police authorities explained three incidents in which they used force in the form of pepper spray, smoke and rubber bullets on crowds they claim already had turned violent. In one case someone jumped on a car stopped in traffic, and in another, people threw rocks and bottles at officers and bystanders, they said. Authorities arrested five people, one of whom is a juvenile, on charges ranging from resisting arrest to inciting a riot and aggravated assault. All four of the adults remained jailed in lieu of more than $100,000 bail.  'Cop who shoved kneeling protester is relieved of duty and will face investigation[38]' via Mario Ariza of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 A Fort Lauderdale police officer seen on video shoving a kneeling protester during Sunday's demonstrations against police violence has been relieved of duty pending a criminal investigation. And an administrative review will determine if he gets to keep his job. The confrontation between the kneeling demonstrator and Officer Steven Pohorence came at the tail end of what had been a peaceful protest, escalating an already tense situation. In social video, Pohorence can be seen walking into the crowd, ordering protesters to disperse. But Pohorence walks too far and becomes encircled. As he turns to walk away, a kneeling woman wearing a white T-shirt and a face covering blocks his path. Pohorence shoves her out of the way, pushing her to the ground. 'Mayor says West Palm police did not start confrontation with protesters[39]' via Olivia Hitchcock of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 Allegations that West Palm Beach police started a violent confrontation with protesters Sunday night 'are 100 percent, unequivocally false,\u2033 Mayor Keith James said. At about 8:15 p.m. Sunday, James said, Police Chief Frank Adderley called to say officers were 'under attack due to a rock-throwing crowd,' leading James to impose a 9 p.m. curfew. Adderley said protests in the city were 'peaceful' from 11 a.m. until about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The city even went as far as to block traffic to allow protests to happen. 'Tampa extends overnight curfew[40]' via Brendan Ward of the Tampa Bay Business Journal \u2014 The city of Tampa has decided to extend its curfew through Monday night, Mayor Jane Castor announced. The curfew which was initially enacted Sunday following protests Saturday that lead to businesses being looted in the University Mall area. A Champ's Sports and the Saigon Bay restaurant were also destroyed during the protests. St. Petersburg saw two nights of protests as well, though, they stayed mostly peaceful. 'Hundreds demonstrate across Tampa Bay over Floyd killing[41]' via Josh Fiallo, Josh Solomon and Divya Kumar of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 They were following other protests from across the country, some of which have turned violent. But the demonstrations in Tampa Bay so far have been largely peaceful, though punctuated by tense and angry moments. In downtown Tampa, demonstrators chanted obscenities toward the police. In Temple Terrace, they shut down a major roadway and threw water bottles at a police officer's car. Most of the protests wound down after several hours. But this evening, hundreds of people from the Temple Terrace protest were still gathered near the District 2 Tampa Police Station, close to Busch Gardens. Protesters were throwing loud fireworks at the ground and bottles of liquid at officers. Police officers holding riot shields had arrived. 'Protesters worry that Tampa looting, police clashes will overshadow message[42]' via Jack Evans of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Those who had gathered in Tampa's streets and parks Saturday and Sunday, to protest the police killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor and others as well as the general condition of policing and race in America, were also grappling with their complicated feelings about how the weekend had gone. They'd raised voices with messages that black lives matter, that police brutality must end, that American law enforcement systems are poisoned to the bone with racism. And they had also seen explosive moments of conflict that they worried would overshadow those messages or would brutally prove their point. 'They're not about the protest,' Teddy Holloman said of the looters. 'They have nothing to do with this.' 'Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson praises peaceful Floyd protests at Graffiti Bridge[43]' via Jim Little of the Pensacola News Journal \u2014 Demonstrations in Pensacola remained peaceful, drawing hundreds of people over multiple days. Robinson praised the protesters during his weekly virtual press conference, saying he was proud of community members for voicing their anger over the death of Floyd without turning to violence. Demonstrations in Pensacola were centered at the 17th Avenue railroad trestle, better known at the Graffiti Bridge, where Pensacola artist Brandon Vessels painted a portrait of Floyd that became a memorial to those who have been killed by police.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/graffitti-bridge.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/graffitti-bridge.jpg</url> Pensacola's Graffiti Bridge was the scene of another peaceful protest. Image via the Pensacola News Journal. 'Supporters bring water, food to Graffiti Bridge activists[44] via Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal \u2014 Activists baked under the sun as they sat and stood quietly around the Graffiti Bridge, signs and fists raised in the air. Nearly every other car that drove under the bridge honked, with some drivers rolling down their windows and sticking their fists in the air in solidarity. Some drivers stopped, got out and joined the peaceful protest. Some parked and delivered coolers full of water, energy drinks, food and ice cream to the protesters. It marked the fourth straight day of peaceful protests in Pensacola in response to the death of Floyd. 'Tallahassee law enforcement leaders, protesters talk 'concessions' during negotiations[45]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 After protesters took to the streets of Tallahassee over the weekend, several organizers met with the city's top law enforcement officials. Tesia Lisbon, a graduate student at Florida State University, demanded the public release of body camera video of the shooting of Tony McDade last week by Tallahassee Police officers. Police say McDade was armed with a gun following a fatal stabbing. Activists at the meeting also asked that Zackri Jones, the officer who shot Mychael Johnson in March, be arrested.\u2014 CORONAFLORIDA \u2014 'In three months of coronavirus crisis, Florida cases rise to 56,830 with 2,460 deaths[46]' via Michelle Marchante of the Miami Herald \u2014 Florida's Department of Health confirmed 667 additional cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of known cases to 56,830 as the state enters the fourth month of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the newly confirmed cases in the latest report is in the Florida Keys, which has just reopened to tourists. There were also nine new deaths announced across the state, raising the statewide toll to 2,460.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Miami-coronavirus-testing.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Miami-coronavirus-testing.jpg</url> A drive-thru testing facility at Tamiami Park in Miami.

'Florida's antibody tests suggest little disease spread, with 4.4% testing positive[47]' via Marc Freeman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The first statewide results of COVID-19 antibody tests were released Friday and they appear to provide hope that the disease is not more widespread in Florida than previously known. The state Health Department report showed 123,552 people have had these blood draws, also known as a serology testing, and 5,474, or 4.4%, were positive. These are not diagnostic tests or the familiar nasal swabs that show if you are currently infected. This antibody screening, which began more than a month ago, is supposed to tell whether a person has had COVID-19 or was exposed to the virus long enough to develop some measure of an immune response. 'Even as Floridians begin getting out, GPS data reveals we're still staying close to home[48]' via David Fleshler and Alonso Alcocer of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The virus that shut down much of the world has achieved an almost impossible task: Reducing Florida traffic. The evidence comes from GPS data that shows the total number of miles people travel. It reveals that people in South Florida are driving more than they did at the low point in early April but most are still staying close to home. After traffic hit bottom in April, it increased slightly, with a peak a few days before Memorial Day. But the slight increase suggests that even as people ventured out again after the state began reopening on May 4, they aren't going far. 'Florida shows the right way to lock down for coronavirus \u2014 and loosen up[49]' via Michael Hendrix of the New York Post \u2014 For a moment in April, the Internet tried to cancel Florida. The media spun scenes of ignorant spring breakers endangering themselves and others. Here was Florida's Governor, DeSantis, joining neighboring state Georgia's 'experiment in human sacrifice,' as a writer put it, by letting locals lift restrictions on their own. Nearly a month later, Jacksonville's Duval County reports new COVID-19 hospitalizations in the single digits. Rates of hospitalizations, cases and deaths remain steady across Florida. Florida's approach, a decentralized health response with targeted lockdowns and quarantines reinforced by voluntary social distancing, appears to have worked. 'Three more inmates die of COVID-19[50]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 As of Monday, 15 state prisoners had died after contracting the virus. The Florida Department of Health earlier reported that seven inmates died at the Blackwater River Correctional Facility. Three inmates died at Sumter Correctional Institution, while one died at Dade Correctional Institution and one at Union Correctional Institution. The number of prisoners who had tested positive for COVID-19 climbed to 1,529 as of Monday morning. The inmate cases are concentrated in 11 prisons in various parts of the state, including Homestead Correctional Institution, Hamilton Correctional Institution, Liberty Correctional Institution and South Bay Correctional Facility. Everglades Correctional Institution, a Miami prison with 30 inmate cases, was the latest prison to report an outbreak. 'COVID-19 arrival slashes tourism numbers[51]' via Jim Turner of News Service of Florida \u2014 Tourism in Florida fell 10.7% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same period a year earlier, and the estimate may be optimistic. The final month of the quarter, March, was impacted heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially shut down the hospitality industry statewide. A report posted online by VISIT FLORIDA, the state's tourism marketing arm, said 'data previously used to estimate Florida visitation may not paint the full picture during COVID-19.' The report estimates that 31.95 million people visited the state during the first three months of the year. That compares to 35.79 million visitors during the first quarter of 2019.\u2014 FLORIDA REOPENING \u2014 'As Florida reopens, how are we doing? These are the numbers to watch.[52]' via Aric Chokey of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 It's been more than three weeks since Florida began the first phase of reopening, a critical point at which experts say we should begin to see how reopening is affecting the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths. Both have been trending down statewide, but the story is different in some counties where the curves are nudging upward again. Data as of May 31 shows Florida reported 56,163 known cases of the coronavirus, which is an increase of 739 from the day before. The state reported 4 more resident deaths since the previous day, putting the known death toll at 2,534 for residents and nonresidents. 'As Florida reopens, the deaths quietly keep piling up in nursing homes[53]' via Carol Marbin Miller and Ben Wieder of the Miami Herald \u2014 Over the most recent week, elders living in long-term care facilities accounted for seven in 10 Florida deaths resulting from the coronavirus, as the pandemic increasingly became a scourge of the old and frail. Though the cumulative overall number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, the illness caused by exposure to the coronavirus, doubled in May, coronavirus deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities tripled. As of Monday, 1,236 people at long-term care facilities had died from COVID-19.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/assisted-living-facility-coronavirus.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/assisted-living-facility-coronavirus.jpeg</url> Assisted living facilities continue to rack up COVID-19 fatalities.

'These jobs could blossom in South Florida after the coronavirus pandemic[54]' via Susannah Bryan of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 There's no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has battered some South Florida businesses to the core. But there is a reason for optimism. Some occupations could see a surge of hiring once the crisis passes, providing opportunities for the tens of thousands of people thrown out of work. White-collar professionals who can work from home will be in demand. More health care workers, particularly home health aides and telemedicine, will be needed to serve South Florida's large elderly population. Higher demand also is likely for physician assistants, nurse practitioners and doctors. App developers and marketers, some working from home, will be in demand to develop strategies for services. Personal trainers, nail techs, hairstylists, and makeup artists might make home visits. 'Keys reopen to visitors as Miami-area beaches closed[55]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 The Florida Keys reopened for visitors after the tourist-dependent island chain was closed for more than two months to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As the Keys took down barriers, Miami-Dade County decided to keep its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the chain. Yet the carefree, party atmosphere that surrounds the Keys and was popularized by singer Jimmy Buffet in songs like 'Margaritaville' may not return for some time. 'The shutdown hit the Florida Keys hard. What will it take to get back to business?[56]' via Gwen Filosa and David Goodhue of the Miami Herald \u2014 Tourism is the lifeblood of the Florida Keys. It pumps up jobs and tax dollars. Supports fishing, hotels, restaurants. With more than five million people who visit Monroe County in a normal year, the island chain typically has the lowest unemployment rate in the state. But with tourists banned from entering the Keys since late March because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Monroe County's unemployment rate shot up to the second-highest in Florida, a whopping 17.5 percent. This time last year, the Keys' unemployment rate was below 2 percent. 'Hotels in Miami-Dade are reopening. There are rules that come with your stay.[57]' via Michelle Marchante and April Rubin of the Miami Herald \u2014 Monday was the first day Miami-Dade hotels and motels reopen to vacationers and staycationers. After a two-months shutdown, the Miami lodging industry has been preparing for this next stage, but with caution. The county mandates hotels to accommodate for social distancing and increased cleaning. All guests must wear a mask or facial covering over mouth and nose during their stay, except inside their hotel room. Employees are also required to wear a mask at all times. Checking in or checking out of a hotel or motel might take longer than usual. Only service animals are allowed to stay inside a hotel room, even if the hotel is pet-friendly.  '#8216;A lot of confusion.' Sunbathers flock to Broward beaches on first open weekend[58]' via Maya Lora of the Miami Herald \u2014 No chairs, no coolers, no umbrellas: That was the official mantra of lifeguards and police officers at Fort Lauderdale Beach. Although there are other rules in place for residents who wish to venture out to the beach after two months of lockdown, few, if any, seem to be getting enforced. Some of the confusion may stem from new rules. When Broward beaches originally reopened, residents were instructed to keep on the move and were not allowed to sit or sunbathe. 'County libraries reopen, but coronavirus has changed experience'[59] via Hannah Morse of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 Palm Beach County libraries reopened, but the coronavirus pandemic will make a patron's experience different. The hours have temporarily changed from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The library system is asking cardholders to limit their visit to one hour and to practice social distancing. Wearing face coverings will be required for the library staff, but just recommended for patrons. Each library's capacity will be reduced to 50 percent, and seating is limited. Plexiglass barriers at the librarian counters have been installed to promote social distancing. Patrons won't be able to use computers, request study rooms, or read newspapers or magazines. 'The party has started: Tampa Bay bars are open, just not all of them[60]' via Christopher Spata of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many are not comfortable returning to bars or restaurants just yet. But some people are. Enough that, if you squinted a little bit, Tampa Bay's night life looked almost normal in some places on Memorial Day. Regardless of safety, the party vibes create a strange juxtaposition with the more sobering signs the coronavirus is still with us. Meanwhile, the owners of bars that do not serve food are watching their competitors do business, wondering why they can't also reopen with the same precautions and limited capacity. 'Getting back to school: Students will wear masks, but what do you do about buses?[61]' via Scott Travis of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Facing the threat of the coronavirus, South Florida's schools could look dramatically different when they reopen this fall, serving both mask-wearing students on campus and virtual learners in their homes. Students and staff may have their temperatures checked. Desks would be at least 6 feet apart. One option being considered is having some students come only part-time, either half a day or on alternate days, and working at home the other days. Local districts say they plan to upgrade cleaning efforts. School districts are surveying parents to see what options they are looking for in the fall.

Instruction will resume online for the week of Nov. 30, and final exams will be online-only Dec. 5 through Dec. 10, when the semester ends. '7 things we'll see at Hard Rock Hollywood casino reopening[64]' via Ben Crandell of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Mandatory masks, full-body thermal scanners, Plexiglas barriers and unplugged slot machines will be the new reality at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp;#38; Casino Hollywood on reopening night. Guests will also see cards and chips be disinfected using a 'creative' process. Restaurants in the casino will have a gradual reopening with social-distancing requirements. Hard Rock hotels will reopen at 25% capacity. The Tampa Hard Rock's program of social distancing and sanitation guidelines is called Safe and Sound, and includes a team of more than 100 actively disinfecting surfaces, with special emphasis on high-touch areas.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hard-rock-casion.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hard-rock-casion.jpg</url> Closed since March, the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp;#38; Casino is set to reopen \u2014 with some significant changes.

'Festivals could be on chopping block as local governments deal with coronavirus effects[65]' via Kristina Webb of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 Royal Palm Beach Village Manager Ray Liggins expects to present a budget for the coming year that does not include some of the village's signature events, including Rocktoberfest, Winterfest and the seafood festival, he told the Village Council at its May 21 meeting. In Wellington, no event is on the chopping block, but residents would see changes if those events are held, Assistant Village Manager Jim Barnes said. 'Our life is going to be different the next 12 to 18 months,' Liggins said. This year's Fourth of July event in Royal Palm Beach is not part of the budget, he said.

That's 76 more than the previous week. Statewide, there have been 1,189 residents of long-term care facilities whose deaths are counted as COVID-19 fatalities. This is an overall increase of 157 deaths in the past seven days. That means there was a 15.2% increase in deaths for the week. Data shows 257 of Florida's long-term care facilities have reported at least one death so far; 21 more facilities have had deaths since a week ago. 'These cleaners mopped up crime scenes. Now they're killing the coronavirus.[67]' via Andrew Boryga of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Many things stand out about how specialists do extensive cleaning at restaurants, hotels and hospitals across South Florida. Some even resemble Ghostbusters as they lug cleaning backpacks to spray every surface. Fort Lauderdale-based Scene Kleen is one of many who have used their experience cleaning blood, mold or bathrooms to bill themselves as coronavirus fighters who can disinfect hospitals, hotels, schools and restaurants. When it comes to coronavirus disinfection, companies have largely made up their own rules for what amount of personal protective equipment to wear.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/coronavirus-cleaning-companies.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/coronavirus-cleaning-companies.jpg</url> Several cleaning companies have shifted from crime scenes to coronavirus cleanup.

'Palm Beach County coronavirus cases inch up with openings[68]' via Jane Musgrave of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 Two weeks after stores, restaurants, gyms and other businesses throughout Florida were allowed to reopen with restrictions, the deadly coronavirus continues its slow and steady march. There are now 6,135 people diagnosed with the highly contagious disease in Palm Beach County, an increase of 139 since Sunday, according to a daily report from the Florida Department of Health. Statewide, there are 56,830 confirmed cases, an increase of 667 overnight. The trend is similar statewide. Over the last two weeks, an average of 749 new cases were added to the state's tally each day. Since life-paralyzing restrictions were eased, the state was reporting an average of 679 new cases each day. 'Amid food shortages, South Florida restaurants raise prices, cut menu items[69]' via Phillip Valys of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Hoping to rebound from a two-month lockdown, South Florida restaurants at half-capacity and barely surviving on sluggish takeout sales are now grappling with food costs creeping higher. Now restaurants are wrestling with the choice to pass these increases to patrons, stop serving certain dishes altogether, or do nothing. Experts say these price surges at restaurants should be temporary, dovetailing with recent spikes in supermarket prices. Shortages cascaded down the country's food supply-chain to South Florida's wholesalers and supermarkets. But some South Florida restaurants won't gamble on losing potential revenue.  'Broward College moves toward dropping athletics amid pandemic, but coaches plan to fight[70]' via David Wilson of the Miami Herald \u2014 Broward College is moving toward dropping athletics and a final decision could come next month. Baseball coach Gregg Bennis said he and a handful of other coaches plan to fight the college's decision leading up to a scheduled vote by the Board of Trustees in June, but he is operating as if the program will be no more, contacting coaches at other schools to find homes for his players. The Seahawks compete in eight sports and all eight teams will cease to exist at the start of the next school year, assuming the Board of Trustees votes to approve the decision next month.        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://govinntallahassee.com\">https://govinntallahassee.com</url> \u2014 MORE LOCAL \u2014 '5 cops at one Florida department exposed to person with coronavirus, possibly a protester[71]' via Tiffini Theisen of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Five Tampa police officers have been exposed to a person with coronavirus, possibly a protester. Demonstrations demanding justice for the death of Floyd, killed in police custody last week in Minneapolis, have been especially large and destructive in Tampa. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said, 'My concern is that they're in the face of our officers. It's difficult for our officers to wear masks when they're out there in the heat and sweating. It's problematic. It'll be interesting to see how many people get exposed \u2014 especially for our first responders.' The officers' exposure happened Sunday. 'When will Pinellas reopen schools? The virus will decide.[72]' via Megan Reeves of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Countless considerations come with reopening schools in a pandemic. Looking toward August, local school officials say they're developing plans that strike the balance of offering effective in-person schooling while keeping students and staff safe from the coronavirus. An outbreak in schools would send ripples of infection through the community. As doctors walked through schools, they hit different issues. Just one example: foreign language labs where kids share headsets. If campuses reopen, the district will likely ask students to bring their own. Officials also are considering moving as many textbooks as possible online so lockers won't be needed. 'Another corrections department worker in Tallahassee tests positive for coronavirus[73]' via Casey Chapter of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 A Florida Department of Corrections employee who works in Tallahassee has tested positive for the coronavirus. The state prisons agency said it was informed of the employee's status on May 19. This is at least the second employee to test positive who works in the department's headquarters in downtown's Carlton Building on South Calhoun Street.

'Arrests starting to increase as Collier County reopens and tries to get back to normal[74]' via Devan Patel of the Naples Daily News \u2014 After a massive drop in arrests during the pandemic, the number of bookings is increasing as Collier County reopens and inches toward a semblance of normalcy. The drop in bookings, at one point down by more than two-thirds, was attributable to two factors: criminals committing fewer crimes and law enforcement officers issuing more 'notice to appear' citations in lieu of arrests. But since businesses began to reopen, the number of daily arrests has increased by 79% versus the average daily numbers during DeSantis' safer-at-home order. 'Delray Beach Fire Rescue offering at-home coronavirus testing for certain residents[75]' via Brett Shweky of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Delray Beach Fire Rescue and the Delray Beach Medical Center recently partnered to ensure local residents that haven't been able to reach a coronavirus testing site receive the screening they need. Homebound seniors and others who want testing but are unable to get to a testing site are eligible to receive the at-home testing from the Delray Beach firefighters and paramedics. In total, 150 test kits were purchased from the Delray Beach Medical Center with about $9,000 donated by members of the community and the Delray Beach Firefighters Benevolent Fund.

In the starkest split, 57percent of Americans overall and 81percent of Democrats say trying to control the spread of the coronavirus is most important right now, even if it hurts the economy. A far smaller 27percent of Republicans agree, while 66percent of them say restarting the economy is more important, even if it hurts efforts to control the virus.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/social-distancing-a-photo.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/social-distancing-a-photo.jpg</url> Americans are more concerned about controlling coronavirus then restarting the economy, according to a new survey.

'Anthony Fauci on COVID-19 reopenings, vaccines, and moving at 'warp speed'[78]' via Helen Branswell of Stat News \u2014 Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has seen the photos of bars packed with mask-less patrons. He was not impressed. That said, these days, Fauci sees reason for cautious optimism about Moderna's vaccine, and others. The idea of having a vaccine by the end of the year is 'aspirational, but it's certainly doable,' he told STAT in a wide-ranging interview. One of the most visible faces of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Fauci also acknowledged the world will have limited data on the new vaccines when they are deployed and may have to balance the need to save lives with the possibility of some adverse events. 'U.S. and Chinese scientists trace evolution of coronaviruses in bats[79]' via James Gorman of The New York Times \u2014 An international team of scientists, including a prominent researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, has analyzed all known coronaviruses in Chinese bats and used genetic analysis to trace the likely origin of the novel coronavirus to horseshoe bats. In the report, they also point to the great variety of these viruses in southern and southwestern China and urge closer monitoring of bat viruses in the area and greater efforts to change human behavior as ways of decreasing the chances of future pandemics. The genetic evidence that the virus originated in bats was already overwhelming. 'Latino homes report serious COVID-19 symptoms nearly twice as often, survey of 1.6 million shows[80]' via Kenny Jacoby and Marco della Cava of the USA Today \u2014 Nearly two-thirds of Wake Forest's Hispanic homes surveyed reported suffering the combination of symptoms most closely tied to the coronavirus, compared to less than 1% of everyone else. Across the nation, Hispanic households said yes to symptoms of COVID-19 nearly a third more often than others. When the list of symptoms is narrowed to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified as the most serious pairs of ailments the differences were far starker: Hispanics experienced them almost twice as often. 'Gilead says drug helped moderately ill coronavirus patients[81]' via Marilynn Marchione of The Associated Press \u2014 A California biotech company says its experimental drug remdesivir improved symptoms when given for five days to moderately ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Gilead Sciences gave few details but said full results would soon be published in a medical journal. Remdesivir is the only treatment that's been shown in a rigorous experiment to help fight the coronavirus. A large study found it could shorten average recovery time from 15 days to 11 days in hospitalized patients with severe disease. The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GILEAD.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GILEAD.jpg</url> Gilead Sciences is having some success with moderately ill patients of COVID-19.

'Eli Lilly begins testing COVID-19 drug derived from blood of survivor[82]' Peter Loftus of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 Eli Lilly &amp;#38; Co. said it began the first study of an experimental drug derived from a blood sample of an early U.S. survivor of COVID-19, a new effort to take advantage of the molecular defenses developed by recovered patients. The company said the testing aims to assess the drug's potential to treat patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. The drugmaker also plans eventually to test whether the antibody-based drug could prevent disease in people at risk of infection, an approach that could serve as a bridge toward curbing the pandemic until a successful vaccine is developed. 'Michigan's Governor lifts a stay-at-home order as other states take steps to reopen.[83]' via The New York Times \u2014 Michigan's Governor lifted a stay-at-home order for the state's 10 million residents, as several other U.S. states announced steps to reopen businesses and public spaces. Effective immediately, the Governor said, groups of 100 people or less will be allowed to gather outdoors while social distancing. Restaurants will also be able to open starting Monday, though tables will be required to be six feet apart.

Optimism about state and business reopenings and the potential development of a coronavirus vaccine has lifted the S&amp;#38;P 500 36% from its March low, cutting its losses for the year to 5.8%. The index rallied 3% last week to cap its best two-month stretch since 2009.

Poor countries face a debt crisis.[85]' via The New York Times \u2014 The Congressional Budget Office projected that the pandemic would inflict a devastating long-term blow to the United States economy, costing $7.9 trillion over the next decade, or a 3 percent loss in 'real' gross domestic product. Without adjusting for inflation the pandemic would cost $16 trillion over the next 10 years. Much of the diminished output was projected to be a result of weaker inflation, as prices for energy and transportation are expected to increase more slowly than they otherwise would have as Americans pull back on travel. 'Policymakers aim to ensure underserved communities have access to PPP loans[86]' via Amara Omeokwe of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 When the Small Business Administration released the application form for the forgivable loan program, there was no instruction for lenders to collect optional demographic information. The agency's inspector general in a recent report noted that omission and said 'it is unlikely that SBA will be able to determine the loan volume' to borrowers in underserved and rural markets. There are some signs the $670 billion program is flowing to firms with fewer employees. The program's average loan size has dropped from $206,000 in mid-April to roughly $115,000 in late May.  'Why politics keeps tanking a bailout idea that works[87]' via Michael Grunwald of POLITICO \u2014 When President Barack Obama took office during the throes of the Great Recession, tax revenues were collapsing and state budgets were hemorrhaging. So, the President proposed an unprecedented $200 billion in direct aid to states. Ultimately, the Democratic Congress approved $140 billion in state aid \u2014 only two-thirds of Obama's original ask. And it worked. Now that Congress is once again debating stimulus for a crushed economy a partisan war is breaking out over state aid. Governors of both parties are now pivoting to austerity, which means more public employees applying for unemployment benefits, fewer state and local services in a time of need, and fewer dollars circulating in the economy. 'Fed should resist market pressure to do more[88]' via Mohamed A. El-Erain of Bloomberg \u2014 After notable disruptions, U.S. financial markets are liquid and functioning well because of the Fed's emergency policy interventions. Government interest rates have been rather rangebound in recent weeks with the 10-year yield ending May broadly unchanged from a month ago. Most companies with capital market access have had no problems issuing bonds. While the economy is challenged in multiple ways, it's hard to argue that this is due to financial conditions that the Fed influences. The Fed could well be tempted to do more anyway on the view that it is essentially a free option. 'Confusion reigns as time runs out on Florida's COVID-19 moratorium on evictions[89]' via Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald \u2014 As the hours tick down on DeSantis' statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, confusion reigns about what will happen when the ban ends as 12:01 a.m. June 2. For now, however, police in Miami-Dade and Broward won't be forcing residents from their homes. DeSantis said he had not yet decided whether to extend the eviction moratorium. Public records show that more than 700 residential and commercial evictions have been electronically filed in Miami-Dade since March 12, when Mayor Carlos Gimnez declared a countywide state of emergency due to the COVID-19 virus. Those filings are sitting inside a legal queue that will be opened when the ban ends. 'Florida's unemployed must now wait in 'virtual room' before logging in, frustrating many[90]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Unemployed Floridians are now required to 'wait in line' to use the state's unemployment website, further aggravating people who were already fed up with the system. Rather than allowing people to automatically log in to the state site, called CONNECT, users now have to enter a virtual 'waiting room' with wait times longer than an hour. Users' progress is indicated by a stick figure walking across the screen. The new process prompted out-of-work Floridians to email reporters and take to Twitter in exasperation. CONNECT is routinely taken down on the weekends and at night, and some users said they were kicked out even after waiting more than an hour to log in. 'They made ends meet before coronavirus.

That's more than the $25,100 that the federal government deems as poverty level for a family of four. They make up 33 percent of Florida's households, up from 22 percent in 2007, according to the report. The poverty rate, meanwhile, stayed around 13 percent of households in the state.

'In reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,' said Alberto Zangrillo, the head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, which has borne the brunt of Italy's coronavirus contagion. 'The swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago,' he said. However new infections and fatalities have fallen steadily in May and the country is unwinding some of the most rigid lockdown restrictions introduced anywhere on the continent. 'Get used to doctors on a screen, heightened focus on respiratory distress[94]' via Wayne Washington of The Palm Beach Post \u2014 When it comes to hospitals and medical care, coronavirus-inspired changes in American life from masks to temperature checks to telemedicine are here to stay, experts say. In many instances, patients won't even see a doctor or nurse in person. They will get medical advice and guidance on a screen in an expanding field known as telemedicine. Doctor's offices will first want to know if the would-be patient has an infectious condition. In the future, if the patient could have something like coronavirus, the doctor's office likely will suggest a specific time for an appointment, a time when the incoming patient can be separated from others. The doctor's office might provide care via telephone, again to eliminate the risk of infection spread.

'Democrats stick with tax-rise policies as they make plans for 2021 majority[98]' via Richard Rubin of The Wall Street Journal \u2014 Democratic lawmakers and policy aides worry little that planned tax increases on corporations and high-income households would hinder the economic recovery. If anything, they argue that economic disparities evident during the pandemic make these tax increases more necessary. Joe Biden's tax proposals are modest compared with those of his former rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Unlike Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, he hasn't endorsed imposing annual wealth taxes. Republicans oppose those tax increases and will campaign against them, warning that they would slow growth and discourage investment. Biden would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and impose additional taxes on foreign profits.

A new tropical depression is 'likely to form within the next day or so,' according to NHC.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Amanda.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Amanda.jpg</url> The remnants of Tropical Storm Amanda is entering the Gulf of Mexico and could cause some problems. 'Florida rethinks hurricane prep in midst of coronavirus[102]' via Brendan Farrington of The Associated Press \u2014 Florida's emergency manager is expressing complete confidence that the state is prepared for a hurricane during the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, but some local directors aren't sharing the same level of certainty. The state has massive stockpiles of personal protection equipment reserved for storms, including 10 million masks, and has new partnerships with hotels, supermarkets and other vendors that put Florida in a good place, said Jared Moskowitz, director of the Division of Emergency Management. 'Clearly nobody has pandemic experience out there in hurricane season,' Moskowitz said. 'Everything that we do will be affected in one way or another \u2014 big and or small \u2014 by COVID-19.' 'Florida residents more concerned for hurricane season amid pandemic[103]' via Insurance Journal \u2014 As Florida gets ready to officially start hurricane season, a new survey shows a majority of residents are more concerned for this year's potential storms than in previous years, given the simultaneous continuing issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the survey of 1,500 Floridians conducted by the statewide hurricane safety initiative, Get Ready, Florida!, 51% of respondents said they are more concerned about hurricane season this year than in previous years because of the pandemic situation versus 45% who said the current situation made no difference. 73% of respondents are concerned about potential hurricanes, in general, this year, with 24% of respondents indicating they are very concerned and 48% saying they are somewhat concerned. 'Duke adds to solar energy projects[104]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 Duke Energy Florida plans to open five solar-power plants in 2021, according to a regulatory filing at the Florida Public Service Commission, which indicated the costs of the plants will range from $98 million to $109 million, with each having a capacity of slightly less than 75 megawatts. Two projects \u2014 the Twin Rivers Solar Power Plant in Hamilton County and the Santa Fe Solar Power Plant in Columbia County, are under construction and slated to begin operating in early 2021. The other three projects, known as the Duette Solar Power Plant in Manatee County, the Charlie Creek Solar Power Plant in Hardee County and the Archer Solar Power Plant in Alachua County, are expected to begin operating in late 2021. 'Mary Mayhew seeks managed care extension but eyes future changes[105]' via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Florida health care officials formally asked the federal government to extend for two more years a 'waiver' to allow the state to keep intact its Medicaid program that relies on steering patients into privately run managed-care plans. The request doesn't contemplate making any major immediate revisions to Medicaid, the safety-net health care program for poor people that relies on a mix of state and federal dollars. But Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Mayhew said she is going to propose changes to the program in the coming years. Mayhew said that while there has been an 'evolution' in the Medicaid program, 'there is so much work that needs to be done' to reward quality and ensure timely access to services. 'Even without parade, St. Petersburg honors Pride month[106]' via Josh Solomon of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 There won't be a parade this year to commemorate Pride due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. But that didn't keep city officials from raising the Pride Flag above City Hall. 'While the parade may have been canceled, we are not canceling Pride,' Mayor Rick Kriseman said before the flag raising, flanked by City Council members, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist and a Pride executive. St. Pete Pride first sought to postpone the event, usually held in June, until the fall. Last month, they decided to cancel it for this year altogether. '#8216;Fear for his safety': Florida police union seeks to shield name of officer in McDade shooting[107]' via Jeff Burlew of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 The Florida Police Benevolent Association is seeking to block the city of Tallahassee from releasing the name of the officer who last week shot and killed a stabbing suspect, NaTosha 'Tony' McDade. Stephen Webster, a Tallahassee attorney for the police union, filed a motion Monday in Leon Circuit Court seeking an injunction in the case that ignited large weekend protests in the capital city. The court documents provide new details in the shooting, from the officer's perspective. Over recent days, McDade's name has been invoked by local protesters and human rights groups as another example of police brutality against black people. 'GEO Group sues Netflix for trademark infringement over use of logos in 'Messiah' series[108]' via Ron Hurtibise of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The GEO Group, a Boca Raton-based operator of private prisons and detention centers, is suing Netflix over the streaming provider's depiction of its 'misappropriated trademarks and name' in its original series 'Messiah.' The suit says the series 'falsely accuses GEO of detaining immigrants in overcrowded overheated rooms with chain-link fences and depriving them of beds, bedding, sunshine, recreation and educational opportunities.' Scenes in the fourth episode of the series depict GEO Group's actual logos on shirt sleeves of fictional detention center workers, on the side of cars, and on a bus. 'Magic Leap founder Rony Abovitz stepping aside as CEO[109]' via David Lyons of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Abovitz is stepping aside as chief executive of the financially pressed technology company after the Plantation-based firm raised millions in new funding. In a message to staff dated May 28 on the company's website, Abovitz said he will remain in his post until a successor is found. The decision came after the often-secretive company announced the layoffs of 1,000 employees, or half its payroll, but later raised new money from investors. Magic Leap notified the state of Florida in late April that it intended to permanently lay off 403 people locally on June 21. 'MIT elects its first-ever black woman student body president. She's from Miami[110]' via Howard Cohen of the Miami Herald \u2014 Danielle Geathers, a Miami Country Day grad, was recently named the 2020-2021 Undergraduate Association President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's student body. Geathers is the first black woman in the history of MIT to serve in that role. 'I am really excited,' she told The Tech, MIT's student newspaper. In terms of student diversity, MIT says that about 6% of its undergraduates are black and 47% percent are women. Geathers is the daughter of Marva Wiley, a Miami attorney. She will be a junior in the fall. 'Cindy Banyai wants Robert E. Lee statue taken down in Lee County[111]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics \u2014 Banyai called on Lee County leaders to take down a bust of Confederate Gen. Lee. 'It is necessary to craft solutions together to ensure the safety of all members of our community,' reads a release issued by her campaign. 'The first step is removing the bust of Robert E. Lee from downtown Fort Myers, as well as all other public effigies of the leader of this unsuccessful rebellion against the United States of America.' The county's long history of honoring Lee has been controversial for more than 100 years.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Banyai.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Banyai.png</url> Cindy Banyai is looking to remove Lee County's namesake Confederate statue. First on #FlaPol \u2014 'Florida Chamber announces hires, launches training institute[112]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics \u2014 The Florida Chamber of Commerce stepped up its political hiring ahead of the 2020 elections. Most notable in the hires, Nick Catroppo was named Vice President of Political Operations, a new position. Catroppo boasts campaign experience on several statewide and local contests, working in the past for Attorney General Moody, state Rep. James Buchanan and former U.S. Reps. David Jolly and Richard Nugent. The Chamber also promoted Andrew Wiggins to senior director for Political Affairs and Coalitions Advocacy. Meanwhile, the new Florida Institute for Political Leadership will begin to recruit, train and guide prospective candidates. Chamber leaders note some 4,500 offices are up for election sometime between now and the 2025 election cycle. 'Emilio Gonzlez joins Mercury's Florida team[113]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics \u2014 Mercury has brought on Gonzlez as co-chairman of its Florida team, the bipartisan public strategy firm announced. Gonzlez is a former Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a position he was appointed to by President George W. Bush. During his tenure, he represented the Bush administration before Congress as its senior immigration official and led an enterprise-funded agency of 17,000 employees with a $3 billion budget.\u2014 2020 \u2014 'Mail-in voting is not the bugaboo Trump wants you to believe it is[114]' via Bill Cottrell of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Trump obviously thinks mailed balloting will favor Biden. He tweeted about cutting off federal recovery aid to Michigan and Nevada if they use some of their federal emergency money for postal voting. In any event, it's not illegal, every state runs its own elections and there's apparently no law letting Trump withhold COVID-19 recovery money from states whose election methods give him the willies. And more important, the handy bugaboo that it is, there's no evidence that voting by mail increases fraud. Trump even created a blue-ribbon commission on 'election integrity,' which met twice and gave up without finding anything worth tweeting about. '#8216;Hate just hides': Joe Biden vows to take on systematic racism[115]' via Alexandria Jaffe, Steve Peoples and Will Weissert of The Associated Press \u2014 Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. Biden offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden said.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joe-Biden.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joe-Biden.jpeg</url> Former Vice President Joe Biden touches his face as he speaks to members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware. 'Oddsmakers say Kamala Harris, Demings now top VP sweeps[116]' via Scott Powers of the Florida Politics \u2014 International oddsmakers who take bets on American elections are no longer listing Demings as a long shot to be picked by Biden as the Democrats' nominee for Vice President. In the newest odds, Demings isn't the favorite. California Sen. Harris has pretty much held that position for months and continues to be a heavy favorite among gamblers who seek out United Kingdom-based bookies to play a little action on American politics. It's been a terrible week for Amy Klobuchar, whose prospects may have been victimized by some reports late last week that have since been refuted. 'Will Biden make a former Florida police chief his 2020 running mate?[117]' via Alex Daugherty of the Miami Herald \u2014 Demings' rise from Orlando's first black woman police chief to a congresswoman with a central role in Trump's impeachment trial landed her on Biden's vice presidential shortlist. And now, as protests over the death of Floyd grip the country, those same credentials are propelling Demings further into the national spotlight, with interviews last weekend on 'Meet the Press,' frequent cable news hits and an op-ed titled 'My fellow brothers and sisters in blue, what the hell are you doing?' Demings wouldn't comment on her law enforcement record, and the Biden campaign wouldn't discuss the vice-presidential selection process. \u2014 MORE FROM THE TRAIL \u2014 'Tom Lee says Senate 'isn't the best fit for me'[118]' via Jim Turner of News Service of Florida \u2014 After submitting his resignation to leave the Legislature with two years remaining in his term, Sen. Lee acknowledged serving as Hillsborough County clerk of courts would be a 'good fit' for him. But in a text message over the weekend, the Thonotosassa Republican said the decision to end a long legislative career, which included a stint as Senate President, has been on his mind for several years and wasn't motivated by a run for any local office. 'I learned to govern in a different era, and, for whatever reason, the legislative process has changed,' Lee said. 'Simply put, the Florida Senate just isn't the best fit for me at this time in my life.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-lee.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-lee.jpg</url> Tom Lee admits that the Senate was not a good fit for him. GOP fundraiser in Key West still on \u2014 Top Senate Republicans, undeterred by the pandemic and widespread protests, are planning to hold a fundraiser in Key West sometime in the next few days. As reported by Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida, Senate President-Designate Simpson, who is in charge of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, said the cancellation was discussed 'but our economy is based on tourism, and Keys has been hit unusually hard, so we thought the event was a good way to help them recover. It felt like this event is something we should still do.' 'Ileana Garcia officially files to challenge Jos Javier Rodrguez in SD 37[119]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 Garcia, the Latinas For Trump founder, is officially entering the race to challenge Rodrguez. Garcia, a Republican, was selected by Senate leadership late last week to compete in the contest. 'The sacrifices made by my grandparents, the work ethic instilled in me by my parents, and the opportunities I could only find in the United States are what I plan to bring to the Florida Senate. I am thankful to Senate President-Designate Simpson and Majority Leader [Kathleen] Passidomo for their support in this endeavor.' Garcia will attempt to flip the SD 37 seat for Republicans. 'Joshua Hicks touts impressive fundraising effort for long-shot House bid[120]' via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014 Hicks, running in House District 11, dazzled with receipts from his first few weeks as a candidate, raising almost $18,000. 'I'm incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support our campaign has received in a few short weeks. We are building a strong, grassroots campaign that will have the resources needed to deliver our 'People First' message to voters throughout our First Coast community,' Hicks, a newcomer to the district but not to politics, said. District 11 is a historically conservative redoubt in Northeast Florida, encompassing deep-red Nassau County and traditionally Republican beach communities in Duval. 'Two Democrats focus campaigns on helping small businesses[121]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 As candidates struggle with how and even whether they should campaign during the coronavirus crisis, more are turning to public service than election messaging, including two Florida House Democratic candidates promoting small businesses. 'As a small-business owner myself, I felt there wasn't enough attention during this pandemic to what it is doing to small business owners, like myself. I'm only as good as the next client who walks in the door. A lot of my district is small business,' said Tracey Kagan, candidate for House District 28. Everywhere, candidates are looking for new strategies outside the usual campaign playbook. They can't really go door-to-door. They can't go to events. They can't hold rallies or fundraisers. But they need be active in the community. 'Democrats want court to reconsider ballot order ruling[122]' via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida \u2014 National Democratic Party organizations are asking a federal appeals court to reconsider a decision that rejected a challenge to a decades-old Florida law about how candidates are listed on election ballots. The organizations have requested that the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals take up the case after a three-judge panel on April 29 said the Democratic plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law. The law requires that candidates who are in the same party as the Governor appear first on the ballot \u2014 a requirement that Democrats say unfairly favors Republicans in the GOP-controlled state.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fpl.com/help\">http://www.fpl.com/help</url> \u2014 TOP OPINION \u2014 'How to make this moment the turning point for real change[123]' via Barack Obama on Medium \u2014 As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, many people have reached out asking how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change. First, the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decadeslong failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States. On the other hand, the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence in various forms are putting innocent people at risk. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause. \u2014 OPINIONS \u2014 'An American triumph overshadowed by American tragedy[124]' via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board \u2014 Astronauts returned to space on an American rocket last week, a technological triumph eclipsed by the return of a familiar American tragedy. Our nation's cities burned again last week like they haven't in 50 years, an upheaval sparked by the killing of an unarmed black man by a white Minneapolis police officer. The resulting mass protests, confrontations and destruction took place just as the nation, having surpassed 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, was beginning to emerge from a painful but necessary pandemic shutdown that cost millions of people their jobs. We can start to move forward by acknowledging some fundamental truths, starting with the deep sense of grievance and resentment among African Americans who can easily see themselves on the ground with a cop's knee on their necks.  'Trump is in a free fall \u2014 for now[125]' via Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post \u2014 The magnitude of Trump's polling collapse is breathtaking. Polling in March showed his approval rating nudging into positive territory; the latest poll released this weekend shows him back in negative territory. His personal favorability is net -13. His rating on handling the coronavirus has gone from a net +6 to a net -7. Even more dramatically, from a statistical tie in March, former Vice President Biden's lead has soared to a 10-point lead. Biden has an enormous approval advantage among groups critical to his victory. The poll was completed before the extent of the reaction to Floyd's unjustified killing had played out. 'As upheaval mounts, Trump has no plan[126]' via Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion \u2014 Trump's weekend kicked off with what he called a news conference, although he didn't actually take any questions. Instead, having decided that Biden's alleged weakness on China would be a good campaign theme, Trump decided to get tough with China. By Sunday, he had moved to one of his favorite devices, the fictional tough stand. This one was a tweet about designating 'ANTIFA' a terrorist organization, something the President very likely doesn't have the power to do. 'This is the consequence of Trump's reign of rage[127]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post \u2014 Trump said it best himself four years ago. 'I bring rage out,' he said. 'I always have.' Today America is burning. These are the wages of Trump's hate-filled incumbency. He ignored an approaching pandemic, turning a crisis into a catastrophe in the United States and worsening the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression, with more than 40 million out of work and upward of 100,000 dead. Meanwhile, his constant tearing at the fabric of civil society, his dismantling of the institutions that bind us, and his glorifying of racism and violence have ultimately set America ablaze. 'Think outside the box, Jack Dorsey[128]' via Maureen Dowd of The New York Times \u2014 Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn't as valuable as Facebook's, made some mild moves against the president who has been spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. 'Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,' said one friend of the Twitter chief's. 'He's like somebody trapped in a maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.' Mark Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think Facebook should be 'the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.' 'Twitter: President doesn't know what he's talking about \u2014 and neither do we[129]' via Carl Hiaasen of the Miami Herald \u2014 Twitter has established a new policy of covering up untrue statements from sources on COVID-19 and other topics. Here are some suggested labels for tweets and their meanings. For example, 'over-caffeinated rambling' could be placed on all post-dawn tweets in which the President needlessly repeats words or phrases, indicating an excessive intake of Coca-Cola products. 'What happened in Minneapolis should never happen again[130]' via Gregory Tony for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 What happened in Minneapolis in the last week has shocked the nation, inspiring both mourning and rage: the brutal and unnecessary killing of an unarmed black man happening once again. These issues are personal for me. Before I had stars on my collar, growing up in a very rough, poor neighborhood of Philadelphia, I was that young black boy who had been thrown on the ground by police. Those experiences motivated me to do better for black and brown kids like myself who need protection and a helping hand, not a knee on their throat. All it takes is one incident for an entire community to lose trust and connection with those entrusted to protect them.  'For our white friends desiring to be allies[131]' via Courtney Ariel of Sojourners \u2014 You don't have to have something to say all of the time. You don't have to post something on social media that points to how liberal/how aware/how cool/how good you are. For one out of every three opinions/insights shared by a person of color in your life, try to resist the need to respond with a better or different insight about something that you read or listened to as it relates to their shared opinion. Being an ally is different from simply wanting not to be racist. Some marginalized/disenfranchised folks will tell you not to ask them anything; don't be offended by that. Colorblindness is totally impossible in a nation whose land was taken from the indigenous inhabitants through an attempt at genocide and horrific colonization. 'The Jacksonville two-step[132]' via Nate Monroe for Medium \u2014 A 62-foot granite monument to a Jacksonville-based Confederate military company stands sentinel just feet away from City Hall \u2014 not because black residents, about 30% of the population, ever wanted it there, of course. In fact, no one in power really cares much for it anymore, but few people in power have the courage to act on their private feelings and push to remove it. Mayor Curry told me at the time: 'This isn't my game. Someone else created this situation.' He never did take a side on the issue, which is of course an indirect way of taking a side \u2014 status quo means it stays right where it is. It's amazing how often this kind of thing happens here. 'Joe Henderson: Tampa Mayor Jane Castor showed what it means to be a leader[133]' via Florida Politics \u2014 First, she and Police Chief Brian Dugan walked with peaceful protesters Saturday afternoon to express outrage over the murder of Floydin Minneapolis. It's one thing to express support with words. It's another to show it with action. When the protest march later turned into a full-blown riot Saturday night, though, Castor struck exactly the right tone to a city looking for answers. 'I saw a lot during those 31 years, but I have never seen anything like last night.' That's saying something. The tone Castor struck was at least important as what she said. It was no-nonsense but not strident. She was compassionate but in control.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://beckercovid19.com\">http://beckercovid19.com</url> \u2014 TODAY'S SUNRISE \u2014 Today, COVID-19 takes a back seat to protests of police violence.

It includes another round of $1,200 checks for individuals, as well as extending additional unemployment benefits through the end of the year. \u2014 Florida's budget is taking a hit because of the economic slowdown, and DeSantis plans to use his line-item veto power to reduce overall spending.

'Blue Angels ready for beach air show if COVID-19 permits, public practices up in the air[136]' via Jake Newby of the Pensacola News Journal \u2014 Five to seven times a week, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels are speeding across the Pensacola skies, practicing their demonstration maneuvers as if a portion of the team's 2020 schedule will be salvaged. As of now, that schedule is slated to kick off with the beloved Pensacola Beach Air Show on July 11. Both the Blues and the Santa Rosa Island Authority, which hosts the air show and has the power to nix it, say that the plan 41 days out is to still conduct the show, as well as the July 10 dress rehearsal. Both events are, of course, vulnerable to being canceled as the coronavirus pandemic looms large, but Blue Angels Executive Officer Cmdr.

Locomotive No. 148 brought that harvest from the field to U.S. Sugar's mill to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of its 1920 launch. The locomotive was built by the American Locomotive Company.

Today, he officially filed for Senate District 20. 'For nearly two years I've had the honor to serve our state's veterans and work on behalf of those who answered the call to serve in the United States Armed Forces,' Burgess said. 'Their bravery, commitment to others, and selflessness inspires me each and every day and I will always champion their cause should I be honored to serve in the state Senate.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/burgess-2-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/burgess-2-scaled.jpg</url> Danny Burgess is stepping down from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to mount a run for the Senate. 'I'm excited to start communicating our results-oriented and community-centered message to every corner of Senate District 20 and I look forward to the campaign ahead.' The cornerstone of that message: 'renewing Florida's economic promise and taking care of the most vulnerable among us.' For a candidate that just days ago wasn't expected to be on the ballot, it couldn't be going better. The Pasco native was already a formidable contender, considering his former District 38 seat in the Florida House overlaps with SD 20. Add in legislative and executive experience and Shortly after Thonotosassa Republican Sen. Tom Lee announced he would exit the Legislature midway through his term, Burgess landed endorsements from Senate President-designate Wilton Simpson and Majority Leader Kathleen Passidomo. His pathway was made clearer when Rep. Jamie Grant said he would defer to Burgess if he wanted the seat. As yet, there are no other contenders for the seat   the Governor only called for a special election hours before Burgess made it official   but that could change quickly. Others rumored to be up for the job include former Sen. Dana Young, Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White Pasco County Commissioner Mike Moore and Plant City Mayor Rick Lott. ___ First on #FlaPol  Gov. Ron DeSantis has extended the eviction moratorium until July 1. That ban on evictions and foreclosures was set to expire midnight Monday. But DeSantis has granted an additional 30 days, according to spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferr. Last week, the Governor said he had not decided whether to extend the protections for homeowners and renters but expected to make a decision 'pretty soon.' Democrats have repeatedly asked for the extension throughout the pandemic as the economic reality of a lockdown hit Floridians. Technical problems plaguing the state's unemployment system portal have compounded those hardships. And for those who still haven't been fully paid what they're owed, getting on the phone with a customer service representative has been a continuing problem[1]. That's left many Floridians unable to pay the bills. But as landlords lose income, they too must figure out how to pay the bills. Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson's office on Wednesday sent the Governor a letter calling for the moratorium to be extended until July 1[2], 30 days from the June 2 end date. ___ First in #FlaPol   'Charlie Crist taps former Pete Buttigieg state director as campaign manager[3]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics   St. Petersburg Democratic Rep. Crist is hiring Sydney Throop as his 2020 campaign manager. Throop previously served as the state director for presidential candidate Mayor Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. She also worked as the field director for a Massachusetts Secretary of State campaign and served with the Reason to Believe PAC in Iowa. Throop said she is excited to 'keep the House blue' and 'elect Democrats up and down the ballot.' Crist and Throop will work to maintain the Democratic stronghold of the congressional district 13 in November.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Throop-flag-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Throop-flag-1.jpg</url> Congratulations to Sydney Throop, the former Pete Buttigieg state director who has joined the Charlie Crist reelection campaign.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/flhospitalassociation/;\">https://www.instagram.com/flhospitalassociation/;</url>AMERICA IN CRISIS   'Donald Trump declares he's President of law, order amid protests[4]' via The Associated Press   Trump declared himself 'the President of law and order' and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split-screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers to keep the peace if Governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Donald-Trump-Law-and-order.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Donald-Trump-Law-and-order.jpg</url> With flash bombs in the distance, Donald Trump calls himself the 'law and order' President. Image via AP. 'Family-commissioned autopsy says George Floyd's death was homicide[5]' via Axios   Preliminary results from an independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family found that his death in the custody of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was 'homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,' according to a statement from the family's attorney. The autopsy contradicts preliminary findings from the Hennepin County medical examiner, who found 'no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation,' according to charging documents against Chauvin. The official examination is still ongoing. 'Trump calls protesters 'terrorists' and urges Governors to seek 'retribution'[6]' via Jonathan Martin, Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times   Trump lashed out at Governors for their response to the violence roiling the country, calling protesters 'terrorists,' demanding 'retribution' and warning the Governors they would look like 'jerks' if they did not send them to 'jail for long periods of time.' 'You have to dominate,' Trump told the Governors. If they failed to take a strong hand, he said, the protesters were 'going to run over you, you're going to look like a bunch of jerks.' The tirade, delivered on a private conference call, showed the depth of Trump's anger over protests and riots. 'Trump suggests the kind of 'vicious' response to protests he once hailed from China in Tiananmen Square[7]' via Aaron Blake of The Washington Post   After days of no public remarks about the unrest across the country, Trump offered a glimpse of his vision for dealing with the protesters, rioters and looters: Law enforcement needs to 'dominate.' Trump offered this prescription on a call with Governors that also included urging 10-year prison terms for those apprehended and seemed to suggest that he may have the military take over. It was a bold proposal from Trump. But it's also wholly predictable that Trump would go down this road, given his past comments about such demonstrations. 'Waiting for Trump to speak, and bracing for whether his words will make matters worse[8]' via Eugene Scott of The Washington Post   To get the best sense of what Trump is really focused on and concerned with regarding the uprisings that are occupying the nation, one should turn to his preferred, unfiltered method of communication: Twitter. The president has mostly used social media platform to attack his Democratic rivals and the media, to defend police and to promise a tough stance against those who break laws in their protests. Conservative media hosts have called on the president to deliver remarks aimed at unifying the nation. 'AG William Barr deploying federal riot teams to D.C., Miami to quell unrest, DOJ official says[9]' via Kevin Johnson, Bart Jansen and Kristine Phillips of the USA Today   Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Riot teams are being sent from the federal Bureau of Prisons, while the FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C. A weekend of rioting in the nation's capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people were arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers, including Secret Service agents, were injured. 'Facing protests over use of force, police respond with more force[10]' via Shaila Dewan and Mike Baker of The New York Times   Demonstrations continued across the United States on Sunday as the nation braced for another grueling night of unrest over police shootings. Videos showed police officers in recent nights using batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked. Trump resisted calls to address the tensions roiling the country. Instead, he used Twitter to criticize local Democratic leaders for not doing more to control the protests. Military vehicles in recent nights have moved down city streets as phalanxes of officers in full riot gear fired clouds of noxious gas. 'Matt Gaetz seriously asks: Can we 'hunt' antifa 'terrorists' like we do 'in the Middle East?'[11]' via Pilar Melendez of The Daily Beast   'Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?' the Republican lawmaker said. Gaetz's violent rhetoric comes hours after Sen. Tom Cotton urged Trump to deploy active-duty military personnel to cities in the wake of nationwide protests over the killing of Floyd. On Sunday, Trump claimed that the U.S. government will designate 'antifa' as a terrorist organization after the President blamed them for riots across the country. 'Anarchy, rioting, and looting needs to end tonight,' Cotton said, adding, 'if local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let's see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they're facing off with the 101st Airborne Division.'  'Twitter adds warning label to Gaetz tweet on antifa for glorifying violence[12]' via Cristiano Lima of POLITICO      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/matt-gaetz.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/matt-gaetz.jpg</url> A Matt Gaetz tweet suggests we hunt down antifa like Middle Eastern terrorists; he gets slapped with a warning label for 'glorifying violence.' 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz ridicules Trump response to George Floyd protests: 'He tucks his tail between his legs, hides in a bunker'[13]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Wasserman Schultz tore into Trump for what she described as his hapless response to the protests sparked by the killing of Floyd. 'Where is the president? Where is the president of the United States using the platform that he has to heal the country and bring us together?' she asked during a video news conference. Trump should have addressed the nation to 'acknowledge the hurt and the hundreds of years of racial injustice and pain that exists. But instead, he tucks his tail between his legs, hides in a bunker and allows Rome to burn around him,' Wasserman Schultz said. 'National Guard troop levels reach historic high amid pandemic and protest[14]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics   Amid rising civil unrest and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, troop numbers for the National Guard are at historic highs. 'As a uniformed member of America's military, it breaks my heart to see the country I love in such pain,' said Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel. As of Monday, 66,722 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard were mobilized in 23 states and the District of Columbia in response to protests, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Guard Bureau said personnel assigned to deal with the unrest are trained and equipped to support law enforcement and first responders. ''The norms have broken down': Shock as journalists are arrested, injured by police while trying to cover the story[15]' via Paul Farhi and Elahe Izadi of The Washington Post   At least a dozen journalists injured in cities across America this weekend including a photographer who was blinded in one eye as police fired rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas to quell unrest. In several cases, reporters appear to have been swept up in indiscriminate efforts by authorities to disperse crowds. But in a number of incidents, journalists were injured, harassed or arrested even after identifying themselves as reporters. 'A wave of protests puts a spotlight on U.S. hypocrisy[16]' via Ishaan Tharoor of The Washington Post   Trump may be uniquely bad at bringing a wounded, divided country together. Throughout six consecutive days of unrest in cities across the country, Trump pledged military retribution on protesters engaged in unlawful acts, dismissed their outrage as the work of leftist troublemakers, and said nothing of reports of heavy-handed police actions during the demonstrations. The United States has already scaled back its defense of human rights and the rule of law in other parts of the world. Now the events of the past week have unfurled like the kind of catalog of abuses you'd see documented by U.S.-based rights groups in countries elsewhere. 'Andrew Cuomo says protests should spark U.S. ban on excessive force[17]' via Bloomberg   Protests across the U.S. over the death of Floyd should spark a national ban on excessive force by police officers, Cuomo said. The Democratic Governor said he will be talking to Mayor Bill de Blasio about a potential curfew in New York City, where there were reports of looting and some 'disturbing' videos of police encounters with the crowds. Violent activity by protesters 'obscures the righteousness of the message,' Cuomo said at a press briefing. 'It plays into the hands of people and forces who don't want to make changes.' de Blasio said a curfew is an option but is not planned. Over the weekend, the mayor said police who drove into a crowd of demonstrators were wrong, but that the protesters had created conditions for the incident. 'Louisville police chief fired in aftermath of fatal shooting[18]' via Bruce Schreiner and Sophia Tulp of The Associated Press   Louisville's police chief was fired after the mayor learned that officers involved in a shooting that killed the popular owner of a barbecue spot failed to activate body cameras during the chaotic scene.David McAtee, known for offering meals to police officers, died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. The U.S. attorney said federal authorities will join state police in investigating the fatal shooting. 'Music industry calls for blackout Tuesday amid unrest[19]' via Mesfin Fekadu of The Associated Press   Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd's death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. On Tuesday, June 2, Columbia Records will observe 'Black Out Tuesday,'' the Sony label home to Beyonc, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. 'This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce.jpeg</url> Musicians including Rihanna, Jay-Z, Beyonc, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following George Floyd's death and the worldwide riots. Image via AP. 'Retailers and restaurants across the U.S. close their doors amid protests[20]' via Rachel Lerman and Todd C. Frankel of The Washington Post   Retailers and other businesses in cities across the U.S., including the Bay Area, the District of Columbia, New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Minneapolis, experienced broken windows, thefts and other violence over the weekend. The actions prompted a number of businesses to shut their doors and raised questions about how exactly the actions relate to the protesters, many of whom were peaceful. Walmart on Sunday closed several hundred stores due to potential protests. Amazon said it had adjusted routes or scaled back delivery operations in some cities, while Apple closed an unspecified number of stores on Sunday. 'Read the email Tim Cook sent to Apple employees about Floyd[21]' via Annie Palmer of CNBC   In the memo, Cook condemned the killing and called for the creation of a 'better, more just world for everyone.' 'We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor and life,' Cook said. Cook also acknowledged that racial injustice exists in the U.S., including in 'our criminal justice system' and 'in the disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities,' as well as from economic inequality and disparities in educational opportunities. 'Corporate voices get behind 'black lives matter' cause[22]' via Tiffany Hsu of The New York Times   Major companies are often wary of conflict, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. After Floyd died in Minneapolis, a wide range of companies began to take much more public stances on racial injustice and police violence. Speaking out on social issues is often a calculated decision, a form of 'values and identity-driven targeted marketing,' said Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Some companies were more cautious in their approach. 'Record ratings and record chaos on cable news[23]' via Ben Smith of The New York Times   The power, and the stress, are clearest at Fox News, by far the most-watched American news channel but one that has been in a rolling corporate crisis since its founder, Roger Ailes, was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations almost four years ago. MSNBC has been scrambling in a different way. The channel thrived from 2017 until earlier this year, lifted by its nonstop coverage of the Trump-Russia story and the story's denouement in impeachment. CNN once positioned itself between MSNBC and Fox on the political spectrum. The network has since adopted an increasingly political focus, hosting dozens of Democratic primary town halls and debates since Trump seeks to confront the media. 'Pepper spray sales soar on Amazon[24]' via Spencer Soper of Bloomberg   Amazon.com Inc. shoppers are buying up pepper spray as demonstrations continue around the country and self-defense becomes top-of-mind for some Americans. People are swapping recommendations for self-defense products on social media platforms like Twitter, where users are posting links to Sabre pepper spray on Amazon. Protests have rocked U.S. cities since the killing in police custody of Floyd. Amazon became a pipeline for household essentials such as toilet paper and disinfecting wipes for shoppers hunkered down at home to avoid contracting COVID-19. The spike in pepper spray sales shows how protests around the country are influencing consumer demand.   SITUATIONAL AWARENESS    @morningmoneyben: Sometimes you think, 'how could this year get any worse?' And then it always, always does. There's just no bottom.  @MarcoRubio: Many in the media fell for the calculated deliberate tactics of professional agitators. They knew the street needed to be cleared before 7 p.m. curfew. But they deliberately stayed to trigger police action get the story they wanted, that 'police attacked peaceful protesters.'  @TomCottonAR: Anarchy, rioting, and looting needs to end tonight. If local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let's see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they're facing off with the 101st Airborne Division. We need to have zero tolerance for this destruction.  @MattGaetz: Now that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?  @ChrisLHayes: I think a lot of Americans really don't know how much the American Revolution was precipitated by the Crown's abuse of the policing power against the colonists. It was *central* and often led to unrest, riots, tarring and feathering and the like. Tweet, tweet: @AndrewFeinberg: Wow. As @realDonaldTrump prepares to speak, mounted *federal* police are throwing flashbang grenades at peaceful protesters as military police (and perhaps Bill Barr) look on. Clearly timed for the President's remarks.  @SteveHelling: Make no mistake: when President Trump mentioned our Second Amendment rights in his speech, he was signaling that citizens can and should shoot the protesters.  @PeterBakerNYT: Trump leaves the impression that he wanted exactly this split-screen moment where he talked tough at the very moment troops and police moved against peaceful protesters outside the executive mansion.  @MacStipanovich: Betas who wave AR-15s. I have known very few genuinely tough men who talked about how tough they are. In fact, I cannot remember one. I have known men for years without knowing they had Silver Stars. My guess is you would wear a fire watch ribbon on your lapel.  @AGAshleyMoody: The killing of George Floyd was criminal and I stand with the law enforcement community in condemning it. However, I am absolutely heartbroken and appalled by the riots and looting that has ravaged our state. Destroying small businesses and attacking officers isn't the answer.  @Andrew4Duval: You can't be shocked that the Government you wanted to force people to stay inside for months, shut down businesses, and borrow trillions of dollars with ease is big enough to mobilize personnel and quell any violent protesting.  @CFernandezFL: Members of my family fled an oppressive regime in Cuba because their government used military force to silence people who peacefully assembled in dissent. We just saw the exact same thing happen in the United States of America. All so the President can have a photo op.  @NateMonroeTU: TFW you wake up and realize you're furloughed. Great, great timing.

'Florida has zero-tolerance for violence, rioting and looting,' DeSantis said in a prepared statement. 'George Floyd's murder was appalling, and the Minnesota perpetrators need to be brought to justice, but this cannot be used as a pretext for violence in our Florida communities.' DeSantis remained quiet even as the sometimes violent protests roiled the country, including parts of Florida. On Sunday, the Governor's spokesperson told Florida Politics that the Governor had activated nearly 700 members of the Florida National Guard on Saturday.

In a letter addressed to House Speaker Jos Oliva and Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls, Fried described Sabatini's tweet as reckless and a violation of House rules. 'By encouraging armed violence against protesters, Rep. Sabatini's conduct fails to meet the basic standards of integrity, honor, confidence and professionalism that the House's rules require,' Fried wrote. 'Peaceful protests are appropriate, but 'violent riots must stop,' warns Senate President[28]' via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics   Florida Senate President Bill Galvano weighed in on the death of Minneapolis resident Floyd, killed last week by police. Streets around the country have been rocked by violence and wanton property destruction since. While he backed the peaceful protests, Galvano had a warning for rioters filling streets in Florida and presumably elsewhere. 'Violent riots must stop. I support the efforts of law enforcement and National Guard troops who are working to protect the safety of people and property.' 'Florida Police Chiefs Association condemns officers for role in Floyd's death[29]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics   The Florida Police Chiefs Association joined the calls denouncing a Minneapolis police officer's role in the death of Floyd. Chief Kenneth Albano, president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association, said the events last week need a 'clear and unified message.' 'The Florida Police Chiefs Association condemns the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, and we call for the speedy and impartial trial of Officer Chauvin on this charge,' he said. He also announced the creation of a subcommittee of chiefs and community leaders to submit solutions to the Florida Legislature. 'Lenny Curry said no curfew for Monday night[30]' via David Bauerlein of The Florida Times-Union   Curry announced that he and Sheriff Mike Williams have decided Jacksonville does not need to have a curfew for the second night in a row. 'With the help of law-abiding citizens and the hard work of law enforcement, Sheriff Williams and I have decided to rescind the curfew tonight,' Curry said in an announcement posted on Twitter. 'We have the capacity should the need arise, but we very much appreciate the cooperation of the people of our city.' Curry and Williams agreed Sunday to have an overnight curfew that started at 8 p.m. Sunday and ended at 6 a.m.  'Duval protester aid fund tops $50K[31]' via Steve Patterson of The Florida Times-Union   A fundraising campaign to help people arrested during weekend protests in downtown Jacksonville had raised more than $50,000. The GoFundMe page was set up Saturday night for the Jacksonville Community Action Committee 'to provide community support for those who've had their civil liberties deprived by local law enforcement.' The committee was involved in organizing people who gathered Saturday to protest abuse of force by members of law enforcement, including the killing of Floyd last month in Minnesota. It originally aimed to raise $40,000 in aid. 'Miami chief, Mayor deride arrested protesters as 'outsiders.' But 30 of 57 are from county[32]' via Monique O. Madan, Joey Flechas and David Smiley of the Miami Herald   The morning after peaceful protests morphed into violent demonstrations in downtown Miami, local officials told the public that most of the 'agitators' were 'outsiders.' 'Of the 57 people that were arrested, 13 of those 57 live in the City of Miami. OK? So, we have Minnesota, New York. Georgia. People from outside of the county [who] were arrested,' said Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina. Juan Diasgranados, a spokesman for the corrections department, said only seven of the 57 people arrested are known to have addresses from out of state. 'Protesters march with police in Kissimmee, rally outside Orlando PD headquarters[33]' via David Harris, Katie Rice, Steven Lemongello and Monivette Cordeiro of the Orlando Sentinel   Hundreds of people marched through downtown Kissimmee alongside local police this evening, in a show of solidarity against brutality and in support of justice for Floyd, the Minneapolis man whose death at the hands of officers has sparked nationwide unrest. The march, organized by the Kissimmee and St. Cloud police departments, began at the Kissimmee Civic Center and wove through downtown to KPD headquarters. It has been peaceful, though some area businesses braced for the worst, boarding up windows.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kissimmee-protesters.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kissimmee-protesters.jpg</url> Peaceful protests have continued throughout Central Florida. Image via WFTV. 'Much of South Florida is under curfew for a week[34]' via Lisa J. Huriash, Karina Elwood and Angie DiMichele of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Much of South Florida will be on lockdown at night this week to stem civil protests that have grown violent, potentially endangering the public. A seven-day curfew began Sunday in Broward County, mandating that residents stay indoors from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and that businesses close up shop. Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry imposed the curfew in response to 'growing civil unrest.' Fort Lauderdale issued a 72-hour curfew on Sunday and threatened to arrest violators. In Miami-Dade, a seven-day curfew was put into effect Saturday night, but it was extended Sunday until further notice. 'Prosecutor fired over Facebook post calling demonstrators 'animals'[35]' via Rafael Olmeda of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   A Broward prosecutor who likened protesters to zoo animals in a Facebook post was fired. Amy Bloom, an eight-year veteran of the Broward State Attorney's Office, referred to protesters as 'animals at the zoo' and called their acts shameful. Bloom quickly deleted the post, but not before someone captured an image of it and began sharing it with other Broward lawyers. 'When will people learn that their criminal acts and obnoxious protesting actually gets you nowhere?' she wrote. 'Act civilized and maybe things will change. I've never seen such animals except at the zoo.' She added that her criticisms apply to everyone regardless of race. 'Some county commissioners support curfew, but PBSO does not[36]' via Hannah Morse of The Palm Beach Post   A Palm Beach County commissioner proposed a countywide curfew after reports of vandalism followed a peaceful protest that called for justice in Floyd's death. Yet Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw won't support a countywide curfew, said PBSO spokeswoman Teri Barbera, because he does not think it's necessary. Instead, more law-enforcement officers will be out on patrol to dissuade potential vandals, Barbera noted. 'West Palm mayor, police chief details protest response; some fault tactics[37]' via Olivia Hitchcock of The Palm Beach Post   Of the estimated 3,000 people who protested peacefully Sunday afternoon in West Palm Beach, fewer than 100 'agitators' were to blame for the violence that unfolded that night downtown, city police said during a news conference. Police authorities explained three incidents in which they used force in the form of pepper spray, smoke and rubber bullets on crowds they claim already had turned violent. In one case someone jumped on a car stopped in traffic, and in another, people threw rocks and bottles at officers and bystanders, they said. Authorities arrested five people, one of whom is a juvenile, on charges ranging from resisting arrest to inciting a riot and aggravated assault. All four of the adults remained jailed in lieu of more than $100,000 bail.  'Cop who shoved kneeling protester is relieved of duty and will face investigation[38]' via Mario Ariza of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   A Fort Lauderdale police officer seen on video shoving a kneeling protester during Sunday's demonstrations against police violence has been relieved of duty pending a criminal investigation. And an administrative review will determine if he gets to keep his job. The confrontation between the kneeling demonstrator and Officer Steven Pohorence came at the tail end of what had been a peaceful protest, escalating an already tense situation. In social video, Pohorence can be seen walking into the crowd, ordering protesters to disperse. But Pohorence walks too far and becomes encircled. As he turns to walk away, a kneeling woman wearing a white T-shirt and a face covering blocks his path. Pohorence shoves her out of the way, pushing her to the ground. 'Mayor says West Palm police did not start confrontation with protesters[39]' via Olivia Hitchcock of The Palm Beach Post   Allegations that West Palm Beach police started a violent confrontation with protesters Sunday night 'are 100 percent, unequivocally false,  Mayor Keith James said. At about 8:15 p.m. Sunday, James said, Police Chief Frank Adderley called to say officers were 'under attack due to a rock-throwing crowd,' leading James to impose a 9 p.m. curfew. Adderley said protests in the city were 'peaceful' from 11 a.m. until about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The city even went as far as to block traffic to allow protests to happen. 'Tampa extends overnight curfew[40]' via Brendan Ward of the Tampa Bay Business Journal   The city of Tampa has decided to extend its curfew through Monday night, Mayor Jane Castor announced. The curfew which was initially enacted Sunday following protests Saturday that lead to businesses being looted in the University Mall area. A Champ's Sports and the Saigon Bay restaurant were also destroyed during the protests. St. Petersburg saw two nights of protests as well, though, they stayed mostly peaceful. 'Hundreds demonstrate across Tampa Bay over Floyd killing[41]' via Josh Fiallo, Josh Solomon and Divya Kumar of the Tampa Bay Times   They were following other protests from across the country, some of which have turned violent. But the demonstrations in Tampa Bay so far have been largely peaceful, though punctuated by tense and angry moments. In downtown Tampa, demonstrators chanted obscenities toward the police. In Temple Terrace, they shut down a major roadway and threw water bottles at a police officer's car. Most of the protests wound down after several hours. But this evening, hundreds of people from the Temple Terrace protest were still gathered near the District 2 Tampa Police Station, close to Busch Gardens. Protesters were throwing loud fireworks at the ground and bottles of liquid at officers. Police officers holding riot shields had arrived. 'Protesters worry that Tampa looting, police clashes will overshadow message[42]' via Jack Evans of the Tampa Bay Times   Those who had gathered in Tampa's streets and parks Saturday and Sunday, to protest the police killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor and others as well as the general condition of policing and race in America, were also grappling with their complicated feelings about how the weekend had gone. They'd raised voices with messages that black lives matter, that police brutality must end, that American law enforcement systems are poisoned to the bone with racism. And they had also seen explosive moments of conflict that they worried would overshadow those messages or would brutally prove their point. 'They're not about the protest,' Teddy Holloman said of the looters. 'They have nothing to do with this.' 'Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson praises peaceful Floyd protests at Graffiti Bridge[43]' via Jim Little of the Pensacola News Journal   Demonstrations in Pensacola remained peaceful, drawing hundreds of people over multiple days. Robinson praised the protesters during his weekly virtual press conference, saying he was proud of community members for voicing their anger over the death of Floyd without turning to violence. Demonstrations in Pensacola were centered at the 17th Avenue railroad trestle, better known at the Graffiti Bridge, where Pensacola artist Brandon Vessels painted a portrait of Floyd that became a memorial to those who have been killed by police.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/graffitti-bridge.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/graffitti-bridge.jpg</url> Pensacola's Graffiti Bridge was the scene of another peaceful protest. Image via the Pensacola News Journal. 'Supporters bring water, food to Graffiti Bridge activists[44] via Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal   Activists baked under the sun as they sat and stood quietly around the Graffiti Bridge, signs and fists raised in the air. Nearly every other car that drove under the bridge honked, with some drivers rolling down their windows and sticking their fists in the air in solidarity. Some drivers stopped, got out and joined the peaceful protest. Some parked and delivered coolers full of water, energy drinks, food and ice cream to the protesters. It marked the fourth straight day of peaceful protests in Pensacola in response to the death of Floyd. 'Tallahassee law enforcement leaders, protesters talk 'concessions' during negotiations[45]' via Karl Etters of the Tallahassee Democrat   After protesters took to the streets of Tallahassee over the weekend, several organizers met with the city's top law enforcement officials. Tesia Lisbon, a graduate student at Florida State University, demanded the public release of body camera video of the shooting of Tony McDade last week by Tallahassee Police officers. Police say McDade was armed with a gun following a fatal stabbing. Activists at the meeting also asked that Zackri Jones, the officer who shot Mychael Johnson in March, be arrested.  CORONAFLORIDA   'In three months of coronavirus crisis, Florida cases rise to 56,830 with 2,460 deaths[46]' via Michelle Marchante of the Miami Herald   Florida's Department of Health confirmed 667 additional cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of known cases to 56,830 as the state enters the fourth month of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the newly confirmed cases in the latest report is in the Florida Keys, which has just reopened to tourists. There were also nine new deaths announced across the state, raising the statewide toll to 2,460.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Miami-coronavirus-testing.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Miami-coronavirus-testing.jpg</url> A drive-thru testing facility at Tamiami Park in Miami.

'Florida's antibody tests suggest little disease spread, with 4.4% testing positive[47]' via Marc Freeman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The first statewide results of COVID-19 antibody tests were released Friday and they appear to provide hope that the disease is not more widespread in Florida than previously known. The state Health Department report showed 123,552 people have had these blood draws, also known as a serology testing, and 5,474, or 4.4%, were positive. These are not diagnostic tests or the familiar nasal swabs that show if you are currently infected. This antibody screening, which began more than a month ago, is supposed to tell whether a person has had COVID-19 or was exposed to the virus long enough to develop some measure of an immune response. 'Even as Floridians begin getting out, GPS data reveals we're still staying close to home[48]' via David Fleshler and Alonso Alcocer of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The virus that shut down much of the world has achieved an almost impossible task: Reducing Florida traffic. The evidence comes from GPS data that shows the total number of miles people travel. It reveals that people in South Florida are driving more than they did at the low point in early April but most are still staying close to home. After traffic hit bottom in April, it increased slightly, with a peak a few days before Memorial Day. But the slight increase suggests that even as people ventured out again after the state began reopening on May 4, they aren't going far. 'Florida shows the right way to lock down for coronavirus   and loosen up[49]' via Michael Hendrix of the New York Post   For a moment in April, the Internet tried to cancel Florida. The media spun scenes of ignorant spring breakers endangering themselves and others. Here was Florida's Governor, DeSantis, joining neighboring state Georgia's 'experiment in human sacrifice,' as a writer put it, by letting locals lift restrictions on their own. Nearly a month later, Jacksonville's Duval County reports new COVID-19 hospitalizations in the single digits. Rates of hospitalizations, cases and deaths remain steady across Florida. Florida's approach, a decentralized health response with targeted lockdowns and quarantines reinforced by voluntary social distancing, appears to have worked. 'Three more inmates die of COVID-19[50]' via the News Service of Florida   As of Monday, 15 state prisoners had died after contracting the virus. The Florida Department of Health earlier reported that seven inmates died at the Blackwater River Correctional Facility. Three inmates died at Sumter Correctional Institution, while one died at Dade Correctional Institution and one at Union Correctional Institution. The number of prisoners who had tested positive for COVID-19 climbed to 1,529 as of Monday morning. The inmate cases are concentrated in 11 prisons in various parts of the state, including Homestead Correctional Institution, Hamilton Correctional Institution, Liberty Correctional Institution and South Bay Correctional Facility. Everglades Correctional Institution, a Miami prison with 30 inmate cases, was the latest prison to report an outbreak. 'COVID-19 arrival slashes tourism numbers[51]' via Jim Turner of News Service of Florida   Tourism in Florida fell 10.7% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same period a year earlier, and the estimate may be optimistic. The final month of the quarter, March, was impacted heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially shut down the hospitality industry statewide. A report posted online by VISIT FLORIDA, the state's tourism marketing arm, said 'data previously used to estimate Florida visitation may not paint the full picture during COVID-19.' The report estimates that 31.95 million people visited the state during the first three months of the year. That compares to 35.79 million visitors during the first quarter of 2019.  FLORIDA REOPENING   'As Florida reopens, how are we doing? These are the numbers to watch.[52]' via Aric Chokey of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   It's been more than three weeks since Florida began the first phase of reopening, a critical point at which experts say we should begin to see how reopening is affecting the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths. Both have been trending down statewide, but the story is different in some counties where the curves are nudging upward again. Data as of May 31 shows Florida reported 56,163 known cases of the coronavirus, which is an increase of 739 from the day before. The state reported 4 more resident deaths since the previous day, putting the known death toll at 2,534 for residents and nonresidents. 'As Florida reopens, the deaths quietly keep piling up in nursing homes[53]' via Carol Marbin Miller and Ben Wieder of the Miami Herald   Over the most recent week, elders living in long-term care facilities accounted for seven in 10 Florida deaths resulting from the coronavirus, as the pandemic increasingly became a scourge of the old and frail. Though the cumulative overall number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, the illness caused by exposure to the coronavirus, doubled in May, coronavirus deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities tripled. As of Monday, 1,236 people at long-term care facilities had died from COVID-19.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/assisted-living-facility-coronavirus.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/assisted-living-facility-coronavirus.jpeg</url> Assisted living facilities continue to rack up COVID-19 fatalities. Image via AP. 'These jobs could blossom in South Florida after the coronavirus pandemic[54]' via Susannah Bryan of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   There's no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has battered some South Florida businesses to the core. But there is a reason for optimism. Some occupations could see a surge of hiring once the crisis passes, providing opportunities for the tens of thousands of people thrown out of work. White-collar professionals who can work from home will be in demand. More health care workers, particularly home health aides and telemedicine, will be needed to serve South Florida's large elderly population. Higher demand also is likely for physician assistants, nurse practitioners and doctors. App developers and marketers, some working from home, will be in demand to develop strategies for services. Personal trainers, nail techs, hairstylists, and makeup artists might make home visits. 'Keys reopen to visitors as Miami-area beaches closed[55]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics   The Florida Keys reopened for visitors after the tourist-dependent island chain was closed for more than two months to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As the Keys took down barriers, Miami-Dade County decided to keep its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the chain. Yet the carefree, party atmosphere that surrounds the Keys and was popularized by singer Jimmy Buffet in songs like 'Margaritaville' may not return for some time. 'The shutdown hit the Florida Keys hard. What will it take to get back to business?[56]' via Gwen Filosa and David Goodhue of the Miami Herald   Tourism is the lifeblood of the Florida Keys. It pumps up jobs and tax dollars. Supports fishing, hotels, restaurants. With more than five million people who visit Monroe County in a normal year, the island chain typically has the lowest unemployment rate in the state. But with tourists banned from entering the Keys since late March because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Monroe County's unemployment rate shot up to the second-highest in Florida, a whopping 17.5 percent. This time last year, the Keys' unemployment rate was below 2 percent. 'Hotels in Miami-Dade are reopening. There are rules that come with your stay.[57]' via Michelle Marchante and April Rubin of the Miami Herald   Monday was the first day Miami-Dade hotels and motels reopen to vacationers and staycationers. After a two-months shutdown, the Miami lodging industry has been preparing for this next stage, but with caution. The county mandates hotels to accommodate for social distancing and increased cleaning. All guests must wear a mask or facial covering over mouth and nose during their stay, except inside their hotel room. Employees are also required to wear a mask at all times. Checking in or checking out of a hotel or motel might take longer than usual. Only service animals are allowed to stay inside a hotel room, even if the hotel is pet-friendly.  ''A lot of confusion.' Sunbathers flock to Broward beaches on first open weekend[58]' via Maya Lora of the Miami Herald   No chairs, no coolers, no umbrellas: That was the official mantra of lifeguards and police officers at Fort Lauderdale Beach. Although there are other rules in place for residents who wish to venture out to the beach after two months of lockdown, few, if any, seem to be getting enforced. Some of the confusion may stem from new rules. When Broward beaches originally reopened, residents were instructed to keep on the move and were not allowed to sit or sunbathe. 'County libraries reopen, but coronavirus has changed experience'[59] via Hannah Morse of The Palm Beach Post   Palm Beach County libraries reopened, but the coronavirus pandemic will make a patron's experience different. The hours have temporarily changed from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The library system is asking cardholders to limit their visit to one hour and to practice social distancing. Wearing face coverings will be required for the library staff, but just recommended for patrons. Each library's capacity will be reduced to 50 percent, and seating is limited. Plexiglass barriers at the librarian counters have been installed to promote social distancing. Patrons won't be able to use computers, request study rooms, or read newspapers or magazines. 'The party has started: Tampa Bay bars are open, just not all of them[60]' via Christopher Spata of the Tampa Bay Times   As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many are not comfortable returning to bars or restaurants just yet. But some people are. Enough that, if you squinted a little bit, Tampa Bay's night life looked almost normal in some places on Memorial Day. Regardless of safety, the party vibes create a strange juxtaposition with the more sobering signs the coronavirus is still with us. Meanwhile, the owners of bars that do not serve food are watching their competitors do business, wondering why they can't also reopen with the same precautions and limited capacity. 'Getting back to school: Students will wear masks, but what do you do about buses?[61]' via Scott Travis of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Facing the threat of the coronavirus, South Florida's schools could look dramatically different when they reopen this fall, serving both mask-wearing students on campus and virtual learners in their homes. Students and staff may have their temperatures checked. Desks would be at least 6 feet apart. One option being considered is having some students come only part-time, either half a day or on alternate days, and working at home the other days. Local districts say they plan to upgrade cleaning efforts. School districts are surveying parents to see what options they are looking for in the fall. Assignment editors   The Florida Education Association President Fedrick Ingram, Vice President Andrew Spar, Secretary-Treasurer Carole Gauronskas, and representative members of the Committee on Reopening Our Neighborhood Schools will release final recommendation for reopening PreK-12 public school campuses in a virtual Zoom news conference, 1 p.m. Eastern time.

Classes will start in-person on Aug. 24 and continue through Nov. 25. Instruction will resume online for the week of Nov. 30, and final exams will be online-only Dec. 5 through Dec. 10, when the semester ends. '7 things we'll see at Hard Rock Hollywood casino reopening[64]' via Ben Crandell of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Mandatory masks, full-body thermal scanners, Plexiglas barriers and unplugged slot machines will be the new reality at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood on reopening night. Guests will also see cards and chips be disinfected using a 'creative' process. Restaurants in the casino will have a gradual reopening with social-distancing requirements. Hard Rock hotels will reopen at 25% capacity.

That's 76 more than the previous week. Statewide, there have been 1,189 residents of long-term care facilities whose deaths are counted as COVID-19 fatalities. This is an overall increase of 157 deaths in the past seven days. That means there was a 15.2% increase in deaths for the week. Data shows 257 of Florida's long-term care facilities have reported at least one death so far; 21 more facilities have had deaths since a week ago. 'These cleaners mopped up crime scenes.

Some even resemble Ghostbusters as they lug cleaning backpacks to spray every surface. Fort Lauderdale-based Scene Kleen is one of many who have used their experience cleaning blood, mold or bathrooms to bill themselves as coronavirus fighters who can disinfect hospitals, hotels, schools and restaurants.

'Palm Beach County coronavirus cases inch up with openings[68]' via Jane Musgrave of The Palm Beach Post   Two weeks after stores, restaurants, gyms and other businesses throughout Florida were allowed to reopen with restrictions, the deadly coronavirus continues its slow and steady march. There are now 6,135 people diagnosed with the highly contagious disease in Palm Beach County, an increase of 139 since Sunday, according to a daily report from the Florida Department of Health. Statewide, there are 56,830 confirmed cases, an increase of 667 overnight. The trend is similar statewide. Over the last two weeks, an average of 749 new cases were added to the state's tally each day. Since life-paralyzing restrictions were eased, the state was reporting an average of 679 new cases each day. 'Amid food shortages, South Florida restaurants raise prices, cut menu items[69]' via Phillip Valys of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Hoping to rebound from a two-month lockdown, South Florida restaurants at half-capacity and barely surviving on sluggish takeout sales are now grappling with food costs creeping higher. Now restaurants are wrestling with the choice to pass these increases to patrons, stop serving certain dishes altogether, or do nothing. Experts say these price surges at restaurants should be temporary, dovetailing with recent spikes in supermarket prices. Shortages cascaded down the country's food supply-chain to South Florida's wholesalers and supermarkets. But some South Florida restaurants won't gamble on losing potential revenue.  'Broward College moves toward dropping athletics amid pandemic, but coaches plan to fight[70]' via David Wilson of the Miami Herald   Broward College is moving toward dropping athletics and a final decision could come next month. Baseball coach Gregg Bennis said he and a handful of other coaches plan to fight the college's decision leading up to a scheduled vote by the Board of Trustees in June, but he is operating as if the program will be no more, contacting coaches at other schools to find homes for his players.

Demonstrations demanding justice for the death of Floyd, killed in police custody last week in Minneapolis, have been especially large and destructive in Tampa. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said, 'My concern is that they're in the face of our officers. It's difficult for our officers to wear masks when they're out there in the heat and sweating. It's problematic. It'll be interesting to see how many people get exposed   especially for our first responders.' The officers' exposure happened Sunday. 'When will Pinellas reopen schools? The virus will decide.[72]' via Megan Reeves of the Tampa Bay Times   Countless considerations come with reopening schools in a pandemic. Looking toward August, local school officials say they're developing plans that strike the balance of offering effective in-person schooling while keeping students and staff safe from the coronavirus. An outbreak in schools would send ripples of infection through the community. As doctors walked through schools, they hit different issues. Just one example: foreign language labs where kids share headsets. If campuses reopen, the district will likely ask students to bring their own. Officials also are considering moving as many textbooks as possible online so lockers won't be needed.

'Arrests starting to increase as Collier County reopens and tries to get back to normal[74]' via Devan Patel of the Naples Daily News   After a massive drop in arrests during the pandemic, the number of bookings is increasing as Collier County reopens and inches toward a semblance of normalcy. The drop in bookings, at one point down by more than two-thirds, was attributable to two factors: criminals committing fewer crimes and law enforcement officers issuing more 'notice to appear' citations in lieu of arrests. But since businesses began to reopen, the number of daily arrests has increased by 79% versus the average daily numbers during DeSantis' safer-at-home order.

In the starkest split, 57percent of Americans overall and 81percent of Democrats say trying to control the spread of the coronavirus is most important right now, even if it hurts the economy.

'Anthony Fauci on COVID-19 reopenings, vaccines, and moving at 'warp speed'[78]' via Helen Branswell of Stat News   Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has seen the photos of bars packed with mask-less patrons. He was not impressed. That said, these days, Fauci sees reason for cautious optimism about Moderna's vaccine, and others. The idea of having a vaccine by the end of the year is 'aspirational, but it's certainly doable,' he told STAT in a wide-ranging interview. One of the most visible faces of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Fauci also acknowledged the world will have limited data on the new vaccines when they are deployed and may have to balance the need to save lives with the possibility of some adverse events. 'U.S. and Chinese scientists trace evolution of coronaviruses in bats[79]' via James Gorman of The New York Times   An international team of scientists, including a prominent researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, has analyzed all known coronaviruses in Chinese bats and used genetic analysis to trace the likely origin of the novel coronavirus to horseshoe bats. In the report, they also point to the great variety of these viruses in southern and southwestern China and urge closer monitoring of bat viruses in the area and greater efforts to change human behavior as ways of decreasing the chances of future pandemics. The genetic evidence that the virus originated in bats was already overwhelming. 'Latino homes report serious COVID-19 symptoms nearly twice as often, survey of 1.6 million shows[80]' via Kenny Jacoby and Marco della Cava of the USA Today   Nearly two-thirds of Wake Forest's Hispanic homes surveyed reported suffering the combination of symptoms most closely tied to the coronavirus, compared to less than 1% of everyone else. Across the nation, Hispanic households said yes to symptoms of COVID-19 nearly a third more often than others. When the list of symptoms is narrowed to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified as the most serious pairs of ailments the differences were far starker: Hispanics experienced them almost twice as often. 'Gilead says drug helped moderately ill coronavirus patients[81]' via Marilynn Marchione of The Associated Press   A California biotech company says its experimental drug remdesivir improved symptoms when given for five days to moderately ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Gilead Sciences gave few details but said full results would soon be published in a medical journal. Remdesivir is the only treatment that's been shown in a rigorous experiment to help fight the coronavirus. A large study found it could shorten average recovery time from 15 days to 11 days in hospitalized patients with severe disease. The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GILEAD.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GILEAD.jpg</url> Gilead Sciences is having some success with moderately ill patients of COVID-19.

The company said the testing aims to assess the drug's potential to treat patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. The drugmaker also plans eventually to test whether the antibody-based drug could prevent disease in people at risk of infection, an approach that could serve as a bridge toward curbing the pandemic until a successful vaccine is developed.

Poor countries face a debt crisis.[85]' via The New York Times   The Congressional Budget Office projected that the pandemic would inflict a devastating long-term blow to the United States economy, costing $7.9 trillion over the next decade, or a 3 percent loss in 'real' gross domestic product. Without adjusting for inflation the pandemic would cost $16 trillion over the next 10 years. Much of the diminished output was projected to be a result of weaker inflation, as prices for energy and transportation are expected to increase more slowly than they otherwise would have as Americans pull back on travel. 'Policymakers aim to ensure underserved communities have access to PPP loans[86]' via Amara Omeokwe of The Wall Street Journal   When the Small Business Administration released the application form for the forgivable loan program, there was no instruction for lenders to collect optional demographic information.

'Why politics keeps tanking a bailout idea that works[87]' via Michael Grunwald of POLITICO   When President Barack Obama took office during the throes of the Great Recession, tax revenues were collapsing and state budgets were hemorrhaging. So, the President proposed an unprecedented $200 billion in direct aid to states. Ultimately, the Democratic Congress approved $140 billion in state aid   only two-thirds of Obama's original ask. And it worked. Now that Congress is once again debating stimulus for a crushed economy a partisan war is breaking out over state aid. Governors of both parties are now pivoting to austerity, which means more public employees applying for unemployment benefits, fewer state and local services in a time of need, and fewer dollars circulating in the economy. 'Fed should resist market pressure to do more[88]' via Mohamed A. El-Erain of Bloomberg   After notable disruptions, U.S. financial markets are liquid and functioning well because of the Fed's emergency policy interventions. Government interest rates have been rather rangebound in recent weeks with the 10-year yield ending May broadly unchanged from a month ago. Most companies with capital market access have had no problems issuing bonds. While the economy is challenged in multiple ways, it's hard to argue that this is due to financial conditions that the Fed influences. The Fed could well be tempted to do more anyway on the view that it is essentially a free option. 'Confusion reigns as time runs out on Florida's COVID-19 moratorium on evictions[89]' via Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald   As the hours tick down on DeSantis' statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, confusion reigns about what will happen when the ban ends as 12:01 a.m. June 2. For now, however, police in Miami-Dade and Broward won't be forcing residents from their homes. DeSantis said he had not yet decided whether to extend the eviction moratorium. Public records show that more than 700 residential and commercial evictions have been electronically filed in Miami-Dade since March 12, when Mayor Carlos Gimnez declared a countywide state of emergency due to the COVID-19 virus. Those filings are sitting inside a legal queue that will be opened when the ban ends. 'Florida's unemployed must now wait in 'virtual room' before logging in, frustrating many[90]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times   Unemployed Floridians are now required to 'wait in line' to use the state's unemployment website, further aggravating people who were already fed up with the system. Rather than allowing people to automatically log in to the state site, called CONNECT, users now have to enter a virtual 'waiting room' with wait times longer than an hour. Users' progress is indicated by a stick figure walking across the screen. The new process prompted out-of-work Floridians to email reporters and take to Twitter in exasperation. CONNECT is routinely taken down on the weekends and at night, and some users said they were kicked out even after waiting more than an hour to log in. 'They made ends meet before coronavirus.

They make up 33 percent of Florida's households, up from 22 percent in 2007, according to the report. The poverty rate, meanwhile, stayed around 13 percent of households in the state.

'Get used to doctors on a screen, heightened focus on respiratory distress[94]' via Wayne Washington of The Palm Beach Post   When it comes to hospitals and medical care, coronavirus-inspired changes in American life from masks to temperature checks to telemedicine are here to stay, experts say. In many instances, patients won't even see a doctor or nurse in person. They will get medical advice and guidance on a screen in an expanding field known as telemedicine. Doctor's offices will first want to know if the would-be patient has an infectious condition. In the future, if the patient could have something like coronavirus, the doctor's office likely will suggest a specific time for an appointment, a time when the incoming patient can be separated from others. The doctor's office might provide care via telephone, again to eliminate the risk of infection spread.

Two projects   the Twin Rivers Solar Power Plant in Hamilton County and the Santa Fe Solar Power Plant in Columbia County, are under construction and slated to begin operating in early 2021. The other three projects, known as the Duette Solar Power Plant in Manatee County, the Charlie Creek Solar Power Plant in Hardee County and the Archer Solar Power Plant in Alachua County, are expected to begin operating in late 2021. 'Mary Mayhew seeks managed care extension but eyes future changes[105]' via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida   Florida health care officials formally asked the federal government to extend for two more years a 'waiver' to allow the state to keep intact its Medicaid program that relies on steering patients into privately run managed-care plans. The request doesn't contemplate making any major immediate revisions to Medicaid, the safety-net health care program for poor people that relies on a mix of state and federal dollars. But Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Mayhew said she is going to propose changes to the program in the coming years. Mayhew said that while there has been an 'evolution' in the Medicaid program, 'there is so much work that needs to be done' to reward quality and ensure timely access to services. 'Even without parade, St. Petersburg honors Pride month[106]' via Josh Solomon of the Tampa Bay Times   There won't be a parade this year to commemorate Pride due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. But that didn't keep city officials from raising the Pride Flag above City Hall. 'While the parade may have been canceled, we are not canceling Pride,' Mayor Rick Kriseman said before the flag raising, flanked by City Council members, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist and a Pride executive. St. Pete Pride first sought to postpone the event, usually held in June, until the fall. Last month, they decided to cancel it for this year altogether. ''Fear for his safety': Florida police union seeks to shield name of officer in McDade shooting[107]' via Jeff Burlew of the Tallahassee Democrat   The Florida Police Benevolent Association is seeking to block the city of Tallahassee from releasing the name of the officer who last week shot and killed a stabbing suspect, NaTosha 'Tony' McDade. Stephen Webster, a Tallahassee attorney for the police union, filed a motion Monday in Leon Circuit Court seeking an injunction in the case that ignited large weekend protests in the capital city. The court documents provide new details in the shooting, from the officer's perspective. Over recent days, McDade's name has been invoked by local protesters and human rights groups as another example of police brutality against black people. 'GEO Group sues Netflix for trademark infringement over use of logos in 'Messiah' series[108]' via Ron Hurtibise of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The GEO Group, a Boca Raton-based operator of private prisons and detention centers, is suing Netflix over the streaming provider's depiction of its 'misappropriated trademarks and name' in its original series 'Messiah.' The suit says the series 'falsely accuses GEO of detaining immigrants in overcrowded overheated rooms with chain-link fences and depriving them of beds, bedding, sunshine, recreation and educational opportunities.' Scenes in the fourth episode of the series depict GEO Group's actual logos on shirt sleeves of fictional detention center workers, on the side of cars, and on a bus. 'Magic Leap founder Rony Abovitz stepping aside as CEO[109]' via David Lyons of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Abovitz is stepping aside as chief executive of the financially pressed technology company after the Plantation-based firm raised millions in new funding. In a message to staff dated May 28 on the company's website, Abovitz said he will remain in his post until a successor is found. The decision came after the often-secretive company announced the layoffs of 1,000 employees, or half its payroll, but later raised new money from investors. Magic Leap notified the state of Florida in late April that it intended to permanently lay off 403 people locally on June 21. 'MIT elects its first-ever black woman student body president. She's from Miami[110]' via Howard Cohen of the Miami Herald   Danielle Geathers, a Miami Country Day grad, was recently named the 2020-2021 Undergraduate Association President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's student body. Geathers is the first black woman in the history of MIT to serve in that role. 'I am really excited,' she told The Tech, MIT's student newspaper. In terms of student diversity, MIT says that about 6% of its undergraduates are black and 47% percent are women. Geathers is the daughter of Marva Wiley, a Miami attorney. She will be a junior in the fall. 'Cindy Banyai wants Robert E. Lee statue taken down in Lee County[111]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   Banyai called on Lee County leaders to take down a bust of Confederate Gen. Lee. 'It is necessary to craft solutions together to ensure the safety of all members of our community,' reads a release issued by her campaign. 'The first step is removing the bust of Robert E. Lee from downtown Fort Myers, as well as all other public effigies of the leader of this unsuccessful rebellion against the United States of America.' The county's long history of honoring Lee has been controversial for more than 100 years.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Banyai.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Banyai.png</url> Cindy Banyai is looking to remove Lee County's namesake Confederate statue. First on #FlaPol   'Florida Chamber announces hires, launches training institute[112]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   The Florida Chamber of Commerce stepped up its political hiring ahead of the 2020 elections. Most notable in the hires, Nick Catroppo was named Vice President of Political Operations, a new position. Catroppo boasts campaign experience on several statewide and local contests, working in the past for Attorney General Moody, state Rep. James Buchanan and former U.S. Reps. David Jolly and Richard Nugent. The Chamber also promoted Andrew Wiggins to senior director for Political Affairs and Coalitions Advocacy. Meanwhile, the new Florida Institute for Political Leadership will begin to recruit, train and guide prospective candidates. Chamber leaders note some 4,500 offices are up for election sometime between now and the 2025 election cycle. 'Emilio Gonzlez joins Mercury's Florida team[113]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics   Mercury has brought on Gonzlez as co-chairman of its Florida team, the bipartisan public strategy firm announced. Gonzlez is a former Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a position he was appointed to by President George W. Bush. During his tenure, he represented the Bush administration before Congress as its senior immigration official and led an enterprise-funded agency of 17,000 employees with a $3 billion budget.  2020   'Mail-in voting is not the bugaboo Trump wants you to believe it is[114]' via Bill Cottrell of the Tallahassee Democrat   Trump obviously thinks mailed balloting will favor Biden. He tweeted about cutting off federal recovery aid to Michigan and Nevada if they use some of their federal emergency money for postal voting. In any event, it's not illegal, every state runs its own elections and there's apparently no law letting Trump withhold COVID-19 recovery money from states whose election methods give him the willies. And more important, the handy bugaboo that it is, there's no evidence that voting by mail increases fraud. Trump even created a blue-ribbon commission on 'election integrity,' which met twice and gave up without finding anything worth tweeting about. ''Hate just hides': Joe Biden vows to take on systematic racism[115]' via Alexandria Jaffe, Steve Peoples and Will Weissert of The Associated Press   Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. Biden offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden said.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joe-Biden.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joe-Biden.jpeg</url> Former Vice President Joe Biden touches his face as he speaks to members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware. 'Oddsmakers say Kamala Harris, Demings now top VP sweeps[116]' via Scott Powers of the Florida Politics   International oddsmakers who take bets on American elections are no longer listing Demings as a long shot to be picked by Biden as the Democrats' nominee for Vice President. In the newest odds, Demings isn't the favorite. California Sen. Harris has pretty much held that position for months and continues to be a heavy favorite among gamblers who seek out United Kingdom-based bookies to play a little action on American politics. It's been a terrible week for Amy Klobuchar, whose prospects may have been victimized by some reports late last week that have since been refuted. 'Will Biden make a former Florida police chief his 2020 running mate?[117]' via Alex Daugherty of the Miami Herald   Demings' rise from Orlando's first black woman police chief to a congresswoman with a central role in Trump's impeachment trial landed her on Biden's vice presidential shortlist. And now, as protests over the death of Floyd grip the country, those same credentials are propelling Demings further into the national spotlight, with interviews last weekend on 'Meet the Press,' frequent cable news hits and an op-ed titled 'My fellow brothers and sisters in blue, what the hell are you doing?' Demings wouldn't comment on her law enforcement record, and the Biden campaign wouldn't discuss the vice-presidential selection process.   MORE FROM THE TRAIL   'Tom Lee says Senate 'isn't the best fit for me'[118]' via Jim Turner of News Service of Florida   After submitting his resignation to leave the Legislature with two years remaining in his term, Sen. Lee acknowledged serving as Hillsborough County clerk of courts would be a 'good fit' for him. But in a text message over the weekend, the Thonotosassa Republican said the decision to end a long legislative career, which included a stint as Senate President, has been on his mind for several years and wasn't motivated by a run for any local office. 'I learned to govern in a different era, and, for whatever reason, the legislative process has changed,' Lee said. 'Simply put, the Florida Senate just isn't the best fit for me at this time in my life.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-lee.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-lee.jpg</url> Tom Lee admits that the Senate was not a good fit for him. GOP fundraiser in Key West still on   Top Senate Republicans, undeterred by the pandemic and widespread protests, are planning to hold a fundraiser in Key West sometime in the next few days. As reported by Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida, Senate President-Designate Simpson, who is in charge of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, said the cancellation was discussed 'but our economy is based on tourism, and Keys has been hit unusually hard, so we thought the event was a good way to help them recover. It felt like this event is something we should still do.' 'Ileana Garcia officially files to challenge Jos Javier Rodrguez in SD 37[119]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   Garcia, the Latinas For Trump founder, is officially entering the race to challenge Rodrguez. Garcia, a Republican, was selected by Senate leadership late last week to compete in the contest. 'The sacrifices made by my grandparents, the work ethic instilled in me by my parents, and the opportunities I could only find in the United States are what I plan to bring to the Florida Senate. I am thankful to Senate President-Designate Simpson and Majority Leader [Kathleen] Passidomo for their support in this endeavor.' Garcia will attempt to flip the SD 37 seat for Republicans. 'Joshua Hicks touts impressive fundraising effort for long-shot House bid[120]' via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics   Hicks, running in House District 11, dazzled with receipts from his first few weeks as a candidate, raising almost $18,000. 'I'm incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support our campaign has received in a few short weeks. We are building a strong, grassroots campaign that will have the resources needed to deliver our 'People First' message to voters throughout our First Coast community,' Hicks, a newcomer to the district but not to politics, said. District 11 is a historically conservative redoubt in Northeast Florida, encompassing deep-red Nassau County and traditionally Republican beach communities in Duval. 'Two Democrats focus campaigns on helping small businesses[121]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics   As candidates struggle with how and even whether they should campaign during the coronavirus crisis, more are turning to public service than election messaging, including two Florida House Democratic candidates promoting small businesses. 'As a small-business owner myself, I felt there wasn't enough attention during this pandemic to what it is doing to small business owners, like myself. I'm only as good as the next client who walks in the door. A lot of my district is small business,' said Tracey Kagan, candidate for House District 28. Everywhere, candidates are looking for new strategies outside the usual campaign playbook. They can't really go door-to-door. They can't go to events. They can't hold rallies or fundraisers. But they need be active in the community. 'Democrats want court to reconsider ballot order ruling[122]' via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida   National Democratic Party organizations are asking a federal appeals court to reconsider a decision that rejected a challenge to a decades-old Florida law about how candidates are listed on election ballots. The organizations have requested that the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals take up the case after a three-judge panel on April 29 said the Democratic plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law. The law requires that candidates who are in the same party as the Governor appear first on the ballot   a requirement that Democrats say unfairly favors Republicans in the GOP-controlled state.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fpl.com/help\">http://www.fpl.com/help</url>   TOP OPINION   'How to make this moment the turning point for real change[123]' via Barack Obama on Medium   As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, many people have reached out asking how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change. First, the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decadeslong failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States. On the other hand, the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence in various forms are putting innocent people at risk. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause.   OPINIONS   'An American triumph overshadowed by American tragedy[124]' via the Orlando Sentinel editorial board   Astronauts returned to space on an American rocket last week, a technological triumph eclipsed by the return of a familiar American tragedy. Our nation's cities burned again last week like they haven't in 50 years, an upheaval sparked by the killing of an unarmed black man by a white Minneapolis police officer. The resulting mass protests, confrontations and destruction took place just as the nation, having surpassed 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, was beginning to emerge from a painful but necessary pandemic shutdown that cost millions of people their jobs. We can start to move forward by acknowledging some fundamental truths, starting with the deep sense of grievance and resentment among African Americans who can easily see themselves on the ground with a cop's knee on their necks.  'Trump is in a free fall   for now[125]' via Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post   The magnitude of Trump's polling collapse is breathtaking. Polling in March showed his approval rating nudging into positive territory; the latest poll released this weekend shows him back in negative territory. His personal favorability is net -13. His rating on handling the coronavirus has gone from a net +6 to a net -7. Even more dramatically, from a statistical tie in March, former Vice President Biden's lead has soared to a 10-point lead. Biden has an enormous approval advantage among groups critical to his victory. The poll was completed before the extent of the reaction to Floyd's unjustified killing had played out. 'As upheaval mounts, Trump has no plan[126]' via Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion   Trump's weekend kicked off with what he called a news conference, although he didn't actually take any questions. Instead, having decided that Biden's alleged weakness on China would be a good campaign theme, Trump decided to get tough with China. By Sunday, he had moved to one of his favorite devices, the fictional tough stand. This one was a tweet about designating 'ANTIFA' a terrorist organization, something the President very likely doesn't have the power to do. 'This is the consequence of Trump's reign of rage[127]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post   Trump said it best himself four years ago. 'I bring rage out,' he said. 'I always have.' Today America is burning. These are the wages of Trump's hate-filled incumbency. He ignored an approaching pandemic, turning a crisis into a catastrophe in the United States and worsening the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression, with more than 40 million out of work and upward of 100,000 dead. Meanwhile, his constant tearing at the fabric of civil society, his dismantling of the institutions that bind us, and his glorifying of racism and violence have ultimately set America ablaze. 'Think outside the box, Jack Dorsey[128]' via Maureen Dowd of The New York Times   Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn't as valuable as Facebook's, made some mild moves against the president who has been spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. 'Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,' said one friend of the Twitter chief's. 'He's like somebody trapped in a maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.' Mark Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think Facebook should be 'the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.' 'Twitter: President doesn't know what he's talking about   and neither do we[129]' via Carl Hiaasen of the Miami Herald   Twitter has established a new policy of covering up untrue statements from sources on COVID-19 and other topics. Here are some suggested labels for tweets and their meanings. For example, 'over-caffeinated rambling' could be placed on all post-dawn tweets in which the President needlessly repeats words or phrases, indicating an excessive intake of Coca-Cola products. 'What happened in Minneapolis should never happen again[130]' via Gregory Tony for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   What happened in Minneapolis in the last week has shocked the nation, inspiring both mourning and rage: the brutal and unnecessary killing of an unarmed black man happening once again. These issues are personal for me. Before I had stars on my collar, growing up in a very rough, poor neighborhood of Philadelphia, I was that young black boy who had been thrown on the ground by police. Those experiences motivated me to do better for black and brown kids like myself who need protection and a helping hand, not a knee on their throat. All it takes is one incident for an entire community to lose trust and connection with those entrusted to protect them.  'For our white friends desiring to be allies[131]' via Courtney Ariel of Sojourners   You don't have to have something to say all of the time. You don't have to post something on social media that points to how liberal/how aware/how cool/how good you are. For one out of every three opinions/insights shared by a person of color in your life, try to resist the need to respond with a better or different insight about something that you read or listened to as it relates to their shared opinion. Being an ally is different from simply wanting not to be racist. Some marginalized/disenfranchised folks will tell you not to ask them anything; don't be offended by that. Colorblindness is totally impossible in a nation whose land was taken from the indigenous inhabitants through an attempt at genocide and horrific colonization. 'The Jacksonville two-step[132]' via Nate Monroe for Medium   A 62-foot granite monument to a Jacksonville-based Confederate military company stands sentinel just feet away from City Hall   not because black residents, about 30% of the population, ever wanted it there, of course. In fact, no one in power really cares much for it anymore, but few people in power have the courage to act on their private feelings and push to remove it. Mayor Curry told me at the time: 'This isn't my game. Someone else created this situation.' He never did take a side on the issue, which is of course an indirect way of taking a side   status quo means it stays right where it is. It's amazing how often this kind of thing happens here. 'Joe Henderson: Tampa Mayor Jane Castor showed what it means to be a leader[133]' via Florida Politics   First, she and Police Chief Brian Dugan walked with peaceful protesters Saturday afternoon to express outrage over the murder of Floydin Minneapolis. It's one thing to express support with words. It's another to show it with action. When the protest march later turned into a full-blown riot Saturday night, though, Castor struck exactly the right tone to a city looking for answers. 'I saw a lot during those 31 years, but I have never seen anything like last night.' That's saying something. The tone Castor struck was at least important as what she said. It was no-nonsense but not strident. She was compassionate but in control.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://beckercovid19.com\">http://beckercovid19.com</url>   TODAY'S SUNRISE   Today, COVID-19 takes a back seat to protests of police violence. Sunrise hears from a Mayor, a minister and two members of Congress, but nothing from the Governor. DeSantis has said nothing in public about the protests, not even the one held outside the Governor's mansion. However, on Monday, we finally got a tweet. Also, on today's Sunrise:   The death toll from COVID-19 continues to rise. There have been at least 2,543 fatalities in Florida and the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is just short of 57,000.   Democrats on Florida's Congressional delegation are trying to convince Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott to support the latest round of COVID-19 stimulus   the HERO Act. It includes another round of $1,200 checks for individuals, as well as extending additional unemployment benefits through the end of the year.   Florida's budget is taking a hit because of the economic slowdown, and DeSantis plans to use his line-item veto power to reduce overall spending. That's why Florida Developmental Disabilities Council CEO Valerie Breen is pleading with DeSantis not to wipe out the gains they made during the Legislative Session. Sunrise speaks with Breen.   And we check in with two Florida Men, where one will make you proud.

'Blue Angels ready for beach air show if COVID-19 permits, public practices up in the air[136]' via Jake Newby of the Pensacola News Journal   Five to seven times a week, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels are speeding across the Pensacola skies, practicing their demonstration maneuvers as if a portion of the team's 2020 schedule will be salvaged. As of now, that schedule is slated to kick off with the beloved Pensacola Beach Air Show on July 11. Both the Blues and the Santa Rosa Island Authority, which hosts the air show and has the power to nix it, say that the plan 41 days out is to still conduct the show, as well as the July 10 dress rehearsal. Both events are, of course, vulnerable to being canceled as the coronavirus pandemic looms large, but Blue Angels Executive Officer Cmdr. Todd Royles said his pilots and his team continue to prepare as if the show will go on.  'U.S. Sugar celebrates end of harvest, uses century-old steam locomotive to haul sugar cane[137]' via Florida Politics staff reports   A century-old U.S. Sugar steam locomotive delivered the end-of-season sugar cane harvest for the first time in more than five decades thanks to a new restoration project. Locomotive No. 148 brought that harvest from the field to U.S. Sugar's mill to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of its 1920 launch. The locomotive was built by the American Locomotive Company.

The 19-year-old who has a passion for Subaru cars was surprised May 13 with a drive-by-parade of his favorite vehicles in front of his Coconut Creek home.

After Gov.Ron DeSantisissued a historic $1 billion in budget vetoes Monday, which the Governor preemptively likened to the bloody scene from 'Game of Thrones' lore, the state is left with a $92.2 billion spending plan for the new fiscal year. Amid those historic cuts, brought on by the COVID-19 economic freeze, DeSantis still found the cash to fund some of his top priorities: teacher and correctional officer raises, environmental projects and affordablehousing.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-JUNE-2020-7.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-JUNE-2020-7.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis vetoed more than $1 billion from the budget, reminiscent of the 'Red Wedding' in 'Game of Thrones.' Image via Colin Hackley.; The state is paying $400 million to raise the minimum teacher salary toward $47,500 and an additional $100 million to give veteran teachers pay raises. Correctional officers are also getting $500 to $2,500 on top of the 3% pay raise allotted for state workers. Along with the budget, more than 100 bills take effect Wednesday, including controversial measures like parental consent for abortions and E-Verify. Outgoing House SpeakerJos Oliva earned his wins on the scope of practice in medicine on bills signed nearly four months ago. And unlike with last year's toll road breakthrough, outgoing Senate PresidentBill Galvanodidn't take major Ws that were his own. Senators' myriad justice reforms didn't see the light of day, except for the officer pay raises and officer shifts that were backed by the Department of Corrections. ___ It is with deep sadness that we report on the passing of William Gregory Turbeville, a lobbyist with Ballard Partners. The following is a statement fromBrian D. Ballard: 'It is with tremendous sadness that I must share the passing of a longtime partner and friend, William Gregory Turbeville[1], who passed away today after a valiant fight against an illness that may have sapped his energy but never his spirit.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tuberville-Flag-6.30.20.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tuberville-Flag-6.30.20.jpg</url> RIP: William Gregory Turbeville. 'Greg was well-known in and beyond Florida, as a policy director for former Gov. Jeb Bush and Chief of Staff for former House Speaker/now FSU President John Thrasher. Public service was in his DNA, and he constantly provided that service honorably and selflessly. 'What wasn't as well-known was his love of music, always armed with a guitar and a thirst for some of his generation's most popular bands. It was a passion matched by another unquenchable love: he was a huge FSU Seminoles fan, garnet and gold proud. 'As much as Greg merited respect with his ideas, he always wore life \u2014 and a love for others \u2014 on both sleeves. 'We feel great sorrow for his family, and our hearts go out to them, because to us Greg will always be family. 'Everyone in the Ballard Partners family was honored to call him our colleague and our friend and we will all miss him dearly. 'May he rest in peace.' ___ Some positive news:There's a new lobbying shop in Tallahassee. After years of experience in the process, top Florida lobbyists Mark Delegal and Josh Aubuchon on Wednesday announced the launch of their new venture: Delegal | Aubuchon. 'This is the culmination of years of experiences,' Delegal said. 'And this is the right time and the right business partner. Our client focus will remain strong, and our size will keep us agile and effective. I'm grateful for the talented Holland &amp;#38; Knight team, and to have worked for a firm of its stature for seven years.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DA_teamphoto_bw-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DA_teamphoto_bw-1.jpg</url> Congratulations to top Florida lobbyists Mark Delegal and Josh Aubuchon on the launch of their new venture: Delegal | Aubuchon. Aubuchon added, 'I'm extremely proud to be going into business with Mark. We've worked together for 12 years and make a great team. I feel grateful to love what I do and help clients working on issues that make an impact in Florida, and I am excited about what we'll be able to accomplish in this new chapter.' The duo boasts decades of experience in the public policy and government relations fields and are already off to a fast start \u2014 Florida Chamber of Commerce EVP David Hart and Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida CEO Justin Senior endorsed their skills on day one. Delegal's and Aubuchon's knowledge spans several major industries, including agriculture, health care, local government, alcoholic beverages, insurance, regulated industries and general business issues. No matter the sector, their mission is the same: Helping their clients effectively navigate the legislative process, and advocate for issues before all branches of state government.

State and federal law already prevent health insurance providers from demanding customers hand over the results of their DNA tests like 23andMe or AncestryDNA. But the new law (HB 1189) will add those protections for the three additional types of insurance. House Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls spearheaded that effort to patch a prospective problem he envisioned when he was applying for life insurance. While he was on hold on the telephone waiting for assistance, the Clearwater Republican said he was struck by advertisements from genetic testing companies encouraging people to buy tests.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sprowls-1.9.20.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sprowls-1.9.20.jpg</url> Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed Chris Sprowls' DNA privacy bill.; Breaking overnight \u2014 'Governor eases regulations on occupational licenses[6]' via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis signed off on the Occupational Freedom and Opportunity Act, easing regulations on licensed practitioners of a wide swath of occupations ranging from body wrapping to boxing announcing. Auctioneers, barbers, electrical contractors, and geologists will have fewer education requirements, with nutritionists, interior designers, landscape architects, nutritionists, accountants, and alarm system installers seeing some licensing requirements eliminated completely. The bill allows for reciprocal licensing from different states. The bill also clears the way for food trucks to operate with impunity statewide, eliminating the fights in many jurisdictions the industry has faced. 'New law requires sea-level impact study for publicly-funded coastal projects[7]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis signed off on legislation requiring publicly-funded coastal project contractors to study nearby environmental effects before building can begin. Democratic Sen. Jos Javier Rodrguez backed the bill while Republican Rep. Vance Aloupis supported the House version. Both lawmakers represent portions of Miami-Dade County. 'In a state where more than two-thirds of the population lives near the coast, requiring planning when state taxpayer dollars are spent on infrastructure in the coastal zone is a necessary and long overdue initial step in addressing the impacts of climate,' Rodrguez said Tuesday. The law does not take effect immediately. Rather, it tasks the Department of Environmental Protection with developing the standard for the newly-required sea level impact projection study. 'Ron DeSantis signs Clean Waterways Act[8]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis has signed the Clean Waterways Act, part of the Governor's latest efforts on environmental protection. The act, which the Governor called 'probably the most comprehensive bill we've seen in quite some time' during a ceremonial signing in Juno Beach, implements several recommendations from the Blue-Green Algae Task Force. Of those recommendations in the priority legislation are improvements to septic systems, stormwater and agriculture runoff. In addition to allowing the Department of Environmental Protection to preemptively inspect the treatment systems, it would transfer septic tank inspection from the Department of Health to DEP, prioritizing environmental health alongside human health. 'DeSantis signs parental consent for abortion into law[9]' via Jim Saunders of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 DeSantis signed a bill that will require parental consent before minors can have abortions, a long-sought goal of abortion opponents in Florida. DeSantis did not make a public statement about the bill signing, but Senate President Galvano, and other supporters praised the measure and said parents need to be involved when their underage daughters consider having abortions. 'The serious and irrevocable decision to end a pregnancy involves undergoing a significant medical procedure that results, in many cases, in lifelong emotional and physical impacts,' Galvano said in a prepared statement. 'DeSantis signs off on Joe Gruters, Randy Fine sewage fine hike[10]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics \u2014 Fines for sewage spills, including from public utility systems, will soon increase significantly. DeSantis signed legislation Tuesday at a Juno Beach ceremony with sponsors Gruters and Fine. The lawmakers said protecting Florida's water remained a chief priority for state government. 'Florida is not Florida without its abundant natural waterways. Water is at the heart of the state's terrific quality of life, and what makes tourism the backbone of our economy,' Gruters said. Fine said few missions are more important.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fine-gruters-.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fine-gruters-.jpg</url> Randy Fine and Joe Gruters get a win on bigger fines for municipal sewage leaks. 'DeSantis kills online learning program amid virus resurgence[11]' via Andrew Atterbury of POLITICO Florida \u2014 With a stroke of his veto pen, DeSantis wiped out the entire $29.4 million budget for a suite of online education services that have become critical to students and faculty during the COVID-19 outbreak. The move, barring action before midnight Tuesday, will kill the Complete Florida Plus Program, an array of technology systems that faculty, staff and students throughout Florida rely on, never more so than now, in the midst of a pandemic that has amplified reliance on distance learning. At least 2,000 adult learners could be cut off from their scholarships and school accreditation could even be at risk without the resources housed under Complete Florida, which are used by students at high schools, state colleges and universities. 'DeSantis signs Alyssa's Law to require panic alarms in Florida schools[12]' via Lisa J. Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 In the school year that starts 2021, every teacher and school staffer in Florida will be able to quietly and quickly tap their cellphone or computer to summon the police. This safeguard will be the result of a new law signed by Florida's governor Tuesday in honor of one of the students killed in the 2018 Parkland high school massacre. Alyssa's Law mandates that mobile panic buttons installed on every teacher and staff's cellphone as an app or as computer software to be programmed to silently alert law enforcement to emergencies or life-threatening situations on all public and charter school campuses. 'Automated pill kiosks now permitted at pharmacies after Governor's signature[13]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis has signed legislation allowing pharmacies to dispense medication through ATM-like kiosks. Those kiosks are already permitted at facilities such as long-term care homes and prisons. The machines will not dole out controlled substances, which can be addicting and are subject to more strict oversight. Democratic Rep. Matt Willhite sponsored the House version of the bill, which ultimately passed. Some Democratic Senators, such as Bill Montford, worried the machines could crowd out smaller pharmacies. Proponents of the measure pointed to the limited drugs available in the kiosks, arguing there would still be room for rural pharmacies. 'Governor lights path for organ transplant discrimination remedies[14]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis is doubling down on the rights of Floridians with disabilities to receive organ transplants with a bill he signed Monday evening. Legislation carried by Jacksonville-area Republicans Rep. Jason Fischer and Sen. Aaron Bean prevents health care facilities, insurers and other entities from denying organ transplant services to people with developmental or intellectual disabilities solely because of that disability. 'A lot of times, we don't know because people didn't know their remedy,' Bean told Florida Politics. The bill outlines a framework in state law for people to seek recourse. 'DeSantis signs bill accommodating persons with pets in emergency shelters[15]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics \u2014 DeSantis signed a bill into law Monday that will require counties with designated emergency shelters to designate a shelter for persons with pets. The bill would also require the Department of Education to play a part in strategizing evacuation for persons with pets in the state comprehensive emergency management plan. The bill is intended to put Florida in line with the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, which mandates state and local governments to consider persons with pets in their emergency preparedness plans and authorizes FEMA to provide rescue, care, shelter and essential needs to persons with pets and service animals following an emergency such as a natural disaster. \u2014 CORONA BUDGET \u2014 'Escambia and Santa Rosa see $5.65 million in cuts from DeSantis veto pen[16]' via Jim Little and Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal \u2014 DeSantis signed Florida's $92.2 billion budget after carving out more than $1 billion in line-item vetoes to programs and projects across the state as it braces for a hit to its revenue from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Local programs and projects in the Pensacola area saw at least a $5.65 million slashed from DeSantis' veto pen from what the Legislature approved earlier this year. DeSantis noted that more than $550 million of the cuts came from his own initiatives, and that the state was facing an unprecedented situation with its economy.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-6.29.20-19.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-6.29.20-19.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis' veto pen hit some communities hard. Image via Colin Hackley. 'DeSantis' budget cuts include $4 million intended to go to Treasure Coast[17]' via Joshua Solomon of TC Palm \u2014 The local reductions, attributed to shortfalls from the coronavirus pandemic, were a part of $1 billion of final cuts, which focused mainly on reducing funds for affordable housing, social services and education. On the Treasure Coast, funding for seven specific projects was slashed, but the overall $1 billion of cuts is expected to result in a reduction of services here, as well. The largest local project vetoed by DeSantis was a $2.3 million planned extension of Hegener Drive in Port St. Lucie. The project is intended to create more jobs in the Southern Grove jobs corridor. The city had planned to match the state funds with $1 million of its own money. The half-mile road, if built, is expected to open access to 106 acres in Tradition. 'TBARTA iced in Florida budget after unprecedented cuts[18]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 The Tampa Bay Area Regional Transit Authority will not be receiving the $1.5 million originally approved in the budget to keep its wheels in motion. DeSantis vetoed the funding as part of his $1.66 million cut, the largest ever in Florida history. Rep. Jackie Toledo filed HB 2483 along with an appropriations request for the funding, which was originally included in the more than $93 million budget. It would have paid for a nearly $300,000 salary and benefits package for TBARTA Executive Director David Green. It also would have included more than $987,000 for additional staff salaries and benefits. 'Cure Violence survives Ron DeSantis vetoes but KIPP charter school loses funding[19]' via David Bauerlein of the Florida Times-Union \u2014 DeSantis left standing $500,000 for expanding the Cure Violence program in Jacksonville and $3 million to help build a new youth sports complex in Clay County. Line items wiped out by DeSantis vetoes included $2 million for the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) charter school in Jacksonville that had been untouchable in previous budgets when it came to vetoes. The state support for Cure Violence will allow Jacksonville to enlarge its reach to cover to a third area of Jacksonville as the city continues to face a wave of homicides. Cure Violence treats violent crime as it were a public health epidemic whose spread can be slowed and constrained.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KIPP-Jacksonville-Campus-With-Skyline-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KIPP-Jacksonville-Campus-With-Skyline-scaled.jpg</url> Once untouchable, KIPP Jacksonville gets the cold shoulder in the 2020-21 budget. 'UF Lastinger Center funds vetoed from budget[20]' via Florida Politics staff reports \u2014 A $1 million appropriation for the University of Florida's Lastinger Center was nixed from the state budget as part of more than $1 billion in vetoes. The funding was set aside for the 'Algebra Nation: Statewide Digital Match Enhancement Program' at the center, which researches new methods for teaching and improving learning outcomes. This is the second straight year the center was included in the budget sent to the Governor's desk but failed to survive the veto pen. In the 2019 Session, the Senate included $2 million for the center in its sprinkle list. His veto doesn't cancel the program, but it does leave it unfunded for the upcoming budget year, which begins July 1.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perspecta.com/transformation\">https://www.perspecta.com/transformation</url> \u2014 CORONAFLORIDA \u2014 'DeSantis extends moratorium on evictions just hours before it would have expired[21]' via Steven Lemongello and Caroline Glenn of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Hours after the dodging the question, DeSantis night extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures until Aug. 1 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The moratorium, ordered by the governor on April 2, was scheduled to end at midnight. Without it, thousands of Floridians would have faced becoming homeless within days because landlords across the state have already filed the court paperwork necessary to remove tenants in anticipation of the order's end. Since April, at least 2,672 evictions have been filed in courts in counties across the state. Once the moratorium has expired, courts will be able to again begin processing cases.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2315-1-scaled.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2315-1-scaled.jpeg</url> Housing activists place eviction order near the entrance of the Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee.

It is the seventh straight day that the number of new cases has jumped by more than 5,000. While far less than the 9,585 new diagnoses that were reported on Saturday, it is well above the numbers that were reported in May that prompted DeSantis to reopen businesses. For the entire month of June, an average of 3,209 new cases were added to state tallies each day. In May, an average of 725 new cases were reported daily. DeSantis has steadfastly refused to issue a statewide order requiring people to wear masks. 'As Florida begins third reopened month, future clouded by rising COVID-19 cases[23]' via John Kennedy of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune \u2014 As Florida braced for beginning its third month of an economic reopening, another 6,093 new coronavirus cases were added to a toll that has spiked sharply over the past week. The climbing caseload has many questioning not only the response of DeSantis and state health officials to the virus but also just how long reopening can endure in its current form.

'DeSantis vetoed affordable housing funds, but there's aid for people impacted by COVID-19[28]' via Rene Rodriguez, Yadira Lopez and Mary Ellen Klas of the Miami Herald \u2014 For the first time in a decade, Florida legislators left funds earmarked for affordable housing intact rather than diverting them into a general-purpose slush fund. But $225 million of the designated monies still won't go to housing, at least for now. DeSantis vetoed $225 million from the Sadowski funds, more than half the total $340 million allocated, essentially freezing the money until legislators come back into Session this fall and vote on an amended budget. That won't happen until after the general election on November 3. \u2014 CORONA LOCAL \u2014 'Escambia, Santa Rosa counties jump 17% Tuesday with record 361 new COVID-19 cases[29]' via the Pensacola News Journal staff reports \u2014 Both Escambia and Santa Rosa counties saw a massive spike in COVID-19 cases overnight, combining for a total of 361 new cases in a single day, a 17% increase. Escambia County increased 250 cases on Tuesday, bringing the total in the county to 1,952 cases, a 15% jump. The median age of infected has dropped to 39.

A similar line formed around the Department of Health's testing site on Gregory Street in downtown Pensacola. As COVID-19 rates in Florida have exploded in recent weeks, so too has the public demand for testing.

'Visitors will see a big change on Key West's Duval Street during the holiday weekend[31]' via Gwen Filosa of the Miami Herald \u2014 Even with beaches and bars closed, Key West still expects crowds this Fourth of July weekend. And they're expected to converge on Duval Street at a time when the Florida Keys are hitting daily record highs in new cases of the novel coronavirus. How can the city help to ensure social distancing? To start, city leaders said they will close most of Duval to cars and turn it into a pedestrian-only walkway for this weekend. That means only pedestrians may use Duval, spreading out into the street. This Fourth of July weekend will have limitations throughout the Keys, along with the historically heavy traffic on U.S. 1. But city leaders say they are ready. 'No plan to close the Keys[32]' via Timothy O'Hara of Keys News \u2014 The Florida Keys may be seeing record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, but there are no immediate plans to shut down the Florida Keys to visitors or erect new checkpoints limiting entrance.

The shutdown includes the 'Fills' area near Indian Key, which is a popular destination for Miami-Dade County residents who enjoy picnicking, barbecuing, swimming and boating there. The village announced Tuesday that the entire area, from mile marker 77.5 to 79.8, will be off limits to parking, tents, chairs and other items, which will be welcome news to many village residents who are often left to clean up the mess left on the roadside beaches following busy weekends. 'Duval County Public Schools unanimously approve use of protective barriers in the classroom[34]' via The Florida Times-Union \u2014 Tuesday the Duval County School Board unanimously approved the use of protective barriers to help separate students during the upcoming school year. The district has already spent about $10.2 million since April 1 on coronavirus-reactive measures. That includes the cost incurred to move the district to distance learning in March. At least $9 million of that has gone to items labeled GSA, which covers the district's bus vendor. Vendors have been delivering meals and instructional packets. Members of the School Board and the district said all of the plans laid out in recent weeks could change at a moment's notice as the number of COVID-19 infections and local mandates continues to fluctuate.

Finnegan's Wake closed after many years in business there, and Fifth and Thomas closed in May.

'No mask mandate for St. Johns County[36]' via Zachery Lashway and Vic Micolucci of News4Jax.com \u2014 A day after Jacksonville enacted a mask mandate for indoor spaces, St. Johns County leaders declined to take it up. After discussing it for hours, only one county commissioner, Henry Dean, wanted a mandatory indoor mask policy. The other four did not second the motion. While they're not required in the county, they are still required in indoor public buildings in St. Augustine city limits. 'I don't think anyone has the answers today to provide a definitive answer that will be effective, will be enforced and will protect everybody,' Commissioner Jimmy Johns said. Leaders heard from a number of members of the community for public comment.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office was able to identify Debra Hunter, of Fernandina Beach as the aggressor in a video that quickly made the rounds online. In the video, Hunter can be seen at a cash register of the Pier 1 store at the St. Johns Town Center being verbally abusive to an employee.

The U.S. has set records for daily new infections in recent days as outbreaks surge mostly across the South and West. The recent spike in new cases has outpaced daily infections in April when the virus rocked Washington state and the northeast, and when public officials thought the outbreak was hitting its peak in the U.S. The sheer size of the U.S. and the fact that the virus is hitting different parts of the country at different times complicates the public response here compared with other countries. 'Senate health chairman urges Donald Trump to wear mask to end political debate[39]' via Jacob Knutson of Axios \u2014 Sen. Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, urged Trump to wear a face mask 'when it's appropriate' to help end the political debate over wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Studies show that wearing masks can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, but efforts to encourage mask-wearing have been complicated by political partisanship and distrust in public health advice. Nationally, the percentage of Democrats who reported wearing a mask all the time when leaving home rose from 49% between April 10 and May 4 to 65% between May 8 and June 22. During the same time period, the percentage of Republicans who reported constant mask-wearing rose from 29% to just 35%.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/200630-lamar-alexander-se-130p_5a004b72ed92f539570556526a17dcc6.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/200630-lamar-alexander-se-130p_5a004b72ed92f539570556526a17dcc6.jpg</url> Lamar Alexander is one of the Senate Republicans urging Donald Trump to start wearing a mask for the good of the country.

'More isolation, tracing, masks needed amid pandemic[40]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 More isolation of COVID-19 patients, increased contact tracing and greater use of face masks in the workplace are needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic, a new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. Less than half, 46%, of patients with COVID-19 who were surveyed by the agency reported known close contact with infected people in the two weeks leading up to their own diagnoses. At 45%, family members topped the list of reported prior known contacts, followed by work colleagues at 34%. The findings came from a telephone survey between April 15 and May 24 of 350 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 at one of 11 academic medical centers. 'U.S. pediatricians call for in-person school this fall[41]' via Anya Kamenetz of NPR \u2014 The nation's pediatricians have come out with a strong statement in favor of bringing children back to the classroom this fall wherever and whenever they can do so safely. The guidance says 'schools are fundamental to child and adolescent development and well-being.' The AAP cites 'mounting evidence' that transmission of the coronavirus by young children is uncommon, partly because they are less likely to contract it in the first place. On the other hand, the AAP argues that based on the nation's experience this spring, remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. 'Millions track the pandemic on Johns Hopkins's dashboard. Those who built it say some miss the real story.[42]' via Kyle Swenson of The Washington Post \u2014 Since launching in January, Johns Hopkins' Coronavirus Resource Center has exploded in scope and popularity, garnering millions of page views and popping up in news coverage and daily conversation. Through numbers, the tracker has told the story of what the virus is doing while the story is still unfolding, offering a nearly real-time picture of its silent march across the globe. But even as data has jumped to the forefront of international discussions about the virus, the Johns Hopkins team wrestles with doubts about whether the numbers can truly capture the scope of the pandemic, and whether the public and policymakers are failing to absorb the big picture. \u2014 CORONA ECONOMICS \u2014 'Top CEOs say business fallout from coronavirus will extend through 2021[43]' via Hannah Denham of The Washington Post \u2014 The chief executives of some of the nation's largest companies expect the ill economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic to extend through 2021, and nearly a third of them say the harm will last even longer. The CEO Economic Outlook Survey fell to 34.3 in the second quarter, the lowest reading for the composite index since the same three months of 2009. But it's well above the all-time low of -5.0, set during the first quarter of 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. Public health concerns continue to weigh on the economy as coronavirus infections surged last week in several states, promoting some to roll back their reopening timelines. 'A national mask mandate could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion, Goldman Sachs says[44]' via Sarah Hansen of Forbes \u2014 As mask-wearing becomes a political flashpoint new research from Goldman Sachs suggests a national mask mandate would slow the growth rate of new coronavirus infections and prevent a 5% GDP loss caused by additional lockdown measures. Goldman's analysts found that wearing face coverings has a significant impact on coronavirus outcomes, and they suggest that a federal mask mandate would 'meaningfully' increase mask usage across the country, especially in states like Florida and Texas, where masks are not currently required. Reducing the spread of the virus through mask-wearing, the analysts found, could be a substitute for strict lockdown measures that would otherwise shave 5%, or $1 trillion, off the U.S. GDP.

Travelers from 14 countries will be welcomed to the EU, including Canada, South Korea and Australia.

Colleges are proposing solutions like residential pods in dorms to balance physical distancing with the need for social contact or digital apps that trade-off privacy for contact tracing. These ideas could provide more flexibility in the future. Every way we approach the question of whether universities can resume on-campus classes, basic epidemiology shows there is no way to 'safely' reopen by the fall semester. If students are returned to campus for face-to-face instruction, the risk of significant on-campus COVID-19 transmission will be unmanageably and unavoidably high. 'California prison officials transferred inmates in an attempt to stop an outbreak.

Late last month, 121 prisoners from the California Institution for Men in Chino, which had nearly 700 cases and nine deaths, were bused to San Quentin, where no inmates were known to have the virus. Now more than 1,000 of the 3,700 prisoners at San Quentin have been infected.

The warping of history with things like the Confederate monument while the civil rights of Blacks were suppressed and the creation of a segregated society for nearly 80 years, allowed for the creation of systemic racism that is the focus of modern protests. The monument was thought to be such a part of Pensacola that when a debate erupted in the 1960s about having Palafox Street cut through the middle of the square, a city council member suggested building a tunnel under the monument rather than disturb it.

In recent weeks, PPD officers have been directed to routinely survey all the monuments and statues within Pensacola's city limits as a part of their daily duties and night patrols. According to law enforcement, if police identify and arrest a suspect in connection to the vandalism, the accused would face a charge of criminal mischief.

Buck McKeon of California has a lucrative second career as a foreign agent lobbying Congress on behalf of the Saudis. Mercenaryism by former members of Congress might raise eyebrows in the communities they once were elected to serve, but not in Washington, where lobbying on behalf of foreign entities is commonplace. An examination of official records shows that over the past five years, more than 50 former members of the House and Senate worked for foreign interests \u2014 including Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Foreign nations cannot send campaign donations directly to U.S. politicians, but they certainly can have lobbyists do so on their behalf. While the Constitution and federal laws prohibit foreign powers from spending money to influence American elections or give anything of value to elected officials, there's nothing stopping them from spending hundreds of millions of dollars to influence American policies by hiring well-connected lobbyists. One such agent \u2014 former Rep. Porter Goss of Florida \u2014 held up his Foreign Agents Registration Act (enacted in 1938 to prevent Nazi infiltration of American politics) disclosures as proof the system provides sufficient transparency. Others acknowledged FARA relies too much on former members' honesty and ethical boundaries. Most remain tight-lipped about their involvement[66]. Former Florida lawmakers who are among the 50 or so former members of Congress[67] now acting as foreign agents include Goss, Wexler, James Bacchus, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Connie Mack IV,Jeff Miller, and Robert Wexler. \u2014 STATEWIDE \u2014 'Hepatitis A cases hit 675 this year[68]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 About a third of the cases are in Duval and Volusia counties, according to newly released data by the state Department of Health. The overall total includes 71 cases diagnosed between June 1 and Saturday. Duval County has had 163 cases this year, while Volusia has had 58, the state numbers show. They are followed by Brevard County, with 47 cases, and St. Johns County, with 37. Florida had a major outbreak of hepatitis A last year, spurring state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees to issue a public health emergency in August. 'Mark Rodin, former head of Seminole Productions at FSU, arrested in $1.2 million fraud case[69]' via Jeff Burlew of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Rodin, the founder and former executive director of Seminole Productions at Florida State University, is facing charges he defrauded the university of $1.2 million. Rodin was arrested on one count of fraud to obtain property of $50,000 or more and 24 counts of grand theft, according to Leon Circuit Court records. He turned himself in at the Leon County Detention Facility and was released after posting bail. Court records show bail set at $25,000 on the fraud charge and $10,000 on the grand theft charges.

'Disney ruling could save hotel companies millions in taxes[70]' via Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Walt Disney World and the lodging industry lobby just won a sweeping legal victory that could save Disney and other big hotel owners millions of dollars in taxes. Ruling in a yearslong lawsuit between Disney and Orange County Property Appraiser Rick Singh, an appellate court determined that Singh's office improperly inflated the value of Disney's Yacht &amp;#38; Beach Club Resort, a luxury hotel with an annual property tax bill of more than $4 million. But attorneys and appraisers say the decision, which was issued June 19, will reverberate far beyond that one hotel. That's because the court declared the entire method that Singh had used to appraise the Disney property, a method that is widely used by other property appraisers, is illegal under Florida law. 'Former Seminole Tax Collector Greenberg pleads not guilty to federal charges[71]' via Martin E. Comas of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Greenberg, who resigned this month as Seminole County's Tax Collector, has entered a plea of not guilty to federal charges of stalking and identity theft against a political opponent, according to a court document. An arraignment hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday in the federal courthouse in downtown Orlando. Greenberg has waived his right to appear at the hearing. Orlando attorneys Mark Horwitz and Vincent Citro also filed documents to say that they have been hired by Greenberg to represent him in federal court. 'Orlando Sentinel's landlord sues over unpaid rent[72]' via Gabrielle Russon of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 The Orlando Sentinel is being sued by its landlord, who says the newspaper didn't pay rent for three months during the coronavirus pandemic. Midtown Opportunities says it's owed about $370,000 for rent from April through June, according to an Orange Circuit Court lawsuit filed June 18 against the newspaper at and its owner, Tribune Publishing Co. The lawsuit seeks unpaid rent as well as interest and legal expenses.  'Miami businessmen, others charged in $1.4 billion health insurance scam in Florida[73]' via Jay Weaver of the Miami Herald \u2014 In one of Florida's biggest health care schemes, 10 business people from Miami and elsewhere have been charged with submitting $1.4 billion in bogus bills for urinalysis and blood tests through rural hospitals. An indictment charges the defendants with bilking Florida Blue and other private insurance companies, which paid out $400 million for tests that were actually done by private labs instead of the rural hospitals. In doing so, the defendants were able to boost their reimbursements because the rural hospitals qualified for higher insurance payments between 2015 and 2018. 'Miami-Dade Commissioner colludes with rail executive to do away with beach connector RFP[74]' via Peter Schorsch of Florida Politics \u2014 As we reported two weeks ago, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner may have violated the County's Cone of Silence Ordinance during a discussion on the Beach Corridor Trunk Line RFP held on at the County Commission meeting June 2. In recent days Florida Politics has become aware of that the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics has opened an investigation into this matter and in less than a week, found that no violation had taken place by either Commissioner Joe Martinez or Jitendra Tomar, the representative for the rail company CAF. This is surprising not only due to the speed with which the COE acted, but with the rush, they may have missed critical evidence that would show possible wrongdoing.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/21319joemartinez.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/21319joemartinez.png</url> Miami-Dade Commissioner Joe Martinez possibly violated the county's Cone of Silence rules. 'Longboat Key's main sewer pipe breaks, spilling sewage[75]' via Timothy Fanning of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune \u2014 The rupture, which could take days to fix, prompted the town to urge all commercial, resort and residential properties to minimize water and wastewater use to control the amount of effluent moving through the underwater pipeline until the repair is completed. Records show the spill began on June 17 but Longboat Key did not publicly report the issue until Monday, nearly two weeks later. The spill's cause has yet to be determined and cleanup will be conducted once the release is stopped. It is unclear how much wastewater was spilled though the volume from the major line failure is considered significant. 'Three outgoing lawmakers seek PSC post[76]' via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Three Republican lawmakers who will leave office in November, including former Senate President Tom Lee, have applied for an opening on the Florida Public Service Commission. Lee, Rep. Holly Raschein and Rep. Mike La Rosa were among seven hopefuls who had submitted applications for the $132,036-a-year position on the panel that regulates utilities, according to the Florida Public Service Commission Nominating Council. The position is available because Commissioner Donald Polmann's four-year term is slated to expire in January. Polmann has submitted an application seeking reappointment by DeSantis.

The ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics reported a huge Trump campaign TV ad buy on Monday: $95 million in six states for ads starting the day after Labor Day through Election Day.

'Would Trump abandon Twitter?[79]' via Ben Shrekinger of POLITICO \u2014 Big Tech is cracking down on Trump, which gives him all the more reason to retreat from its platforms into his own digital ecosystem. The president's reelection campaign and some of his followers had already been joining and promoting alternative social media sites, much as the president pressures Fox News when it displeases him by calling attention to its upstart conservative rival, One America News Network. That was before the most recent wave of crackdowns on Trump and his supporters by social-media firms seeking to remove content that is deemed offensive, inaccurate or both. 'Scenes from Joe Biden's first encounter with the media in months[80]' via Christopher Cadelago and Natasha Korecki of POLITICO \u2014 Biden made the short drive from his now-famous basement, jogged into the high school gym where he usually votes and excoriated Trump as failing miserably to protect the health and safety of Americans. Then, after laying out his own plan to slow the coronavirus, the presumptive Democratic nominee made what now amounts to news in this bizarre election: He opened the floor to questions from reporters, waving off aides when they tried to cut him off and marveling at how strange this has all become. 'I've been tested, and I'm constantly tested,' he said.

'Biden rises with a less-is-more campaign[81]' via Michael Scherer of The Washington Post \u2014 Trump has spent the past month lapping Biden on the campaign trail, traveling to more places with bigger crowds, giving more interviews and dominating daily news coverage. But political strategists in both parties agree that Biden is the one who had benefited so far. A Biden strategy of caution and discipline, which has limited his travel and put news conferences on hold for 88 days, has allowed the Democrat to keep the national focus on Trump and his polarizing approach to the coronavirus pandemic, the economic crisis and widespread fury over racist policing practices. Biden has made no secret of his own thinking on the matter. 'The more that Donald Trump is out the worse he does. I think it is wonderful that he goes out,' Biden joked. \u2014 CONVENTION COUNTDOWN \u2014 'RNC chair Ronna McDaniel insists Jacksonville convention will be 'safe and healthy' after city mandates masks[82]' via Talia Kaplan of Fox News \u2014 Republican National Committee ChairwomanMcDaniel joined 'Fox &amp;#38; Friends' to explain how the RNC plans to hold a safe convention in Jacksonville this August despite the surge of coronavirus cases in the state.

So when Jacksonville announced Monday that it would adopt a face mask requirement for indoor locations where social distancing is not possible, it was headline news. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday that Trump, who has not been seen wearing a mask in public, told her he 'has no problem with masks.'

The back-and-forth will continue, at least for now, after a Florida judge denied Gimnez's motion to dismiss Blanco's lawsuit last week. Blanco is competing with Gimnez in the Republican primary in August. The winner will face incumbent U.S. Rep.

After Gov.Ron DeSantisissued a historic $1 billion in budget vetoes Monday, which the Governor preemptively likened to the bloody scene from 'Game of Thrones' lore, the state is left with a $92.2 billion spending plan for the new fiscal year. Amid those historic cuts, brought on by the COVID-19 economic freeze, DeSantis still found the cash to fund some of his top priorities: teacher and correctional officer raises, environmental projects and affordablehousing.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-JUNE-2020-7.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-JUNE-2020-7.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis vetoed more than $1 billion from the budget, reminiscent of the 'Red Wedding' in 'Game of Thrones.' Image via Colin Hackley.; The state is paying $400 million to raise the minimum teacher salary toward $47,500 and an additional $100 million to give veteran teachers pay raises. Correctional officers are also getting $500 to $2,500 on top of the 3% pay raise allotted for state workers. Along with the budget, more than 100 bills take effect Wednesday, including controversial measures like parental consent for abortions and E-Verify. Outgoing House SpeakerJos Oliva earned his wins on the scope of practice in medicine on bills signed nearly four months ago. And unlike with last year's toll road breakthrough, outgoing Senate PresidentBill Galvanodidn't take major Ws that were his own. Senators' myriad justice reforms didn't see the light of day, except for the officer pay raises and officer shifts that were backed by the Department of Corrections. ___ It is with deep sadness that we report on the passing of William Gregory Turbeville, a lobbyist with Ballard Partners. The following is a statement fromBrian D. Ballard: 'It is with tremendous sadness that I must share the passing of a longtime partner and friend, William Gregory Turbeville[1], who passed away today after a valiant fight against an illness that may have sapped his energy but never his spirit.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tuberville-Flag-6.30.20.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tuberville-Flag-6.30.20.jpg</url> RIP: William Gregory Turbeville. 'Greg was well-known in and beyond Florida, as a policy director for former Gov. Jeb Bush and Chief of Staff for former House Speaker/now FSU President John Thrasher. Public service was in his DNA, and he constantly provided that service honorably and selflessly. 'What wasn't as well-known was his love of music, always armed with a guitar and a thirst for some of his generation's most popular bands. It was a passion matched by another unquenchable love: he was a huge FSU Seminoles fan, garnet and gold proud. 'As much as Greg merited respect with his ideas, he always wore life   and a love for others   on both sleeves. 'We feel great sorrow for his family, and our hearts go out to them, because to us Greg will always be family. 'Everyone in the Ballard Partners family was honored to call him our colleague and our friend and we will all miss him dearly. 'May he rest in peace.' ___ Some positive news:There's a new lobbying shop in Tallahassee. After years of experience in the process, top Florida lobbyists Mark Delegal and Josh Aubuchon on Wednesday announced the launch of their new venture: Delegal | Aubuchon. 'This is the culmination of years of experiences,' Delegal said. 'And this is the right time and the right business partner. Our client focus will remain strong, and our size will keep us agile and effective. I'm grateful for the talented Holland Knight team, and to have worked for a firm of its stature for seven years.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DA_teamphoto_bw-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DA_teamphoto_bw-1.jpg</url> Congratulations to top Florida lobbyists Mark Delegal and Josh Aubuchon on the launch of their new venture: Delegal | Aubuchon. Aubuchon added, 'I'm extremely proud to be going into business with Mark. We've worked together for 12 years and make a great team. I feel grateful to love what I do and help clients working on issues that make an impact in Florida, and I am excited about what we'll be able to accomplish in this new chapter.' The duo boasts decades of experience in the public policy and government relations fields and are already off to a fast start   Florida Chamber of Commerce EVP David Hart and Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida CEO Justin Senior endorsed their skills on day one. Delegal's and Aubuchon's knowledge spans several major industries, including agriculture, health care, local government, alcoholic beverages, insurance, regulated industries and general business issues. No matter the sector, their mission is the same: Helping their clients effectively navigate the legislative process, and advocate for issues before all branches of state government.

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS    @RealDonaldTrmp: As I watch the Pandemic spread its ugly face all across the world, including the tremendous damage it has done to the USA, I become more and more angry at China. People can see it, and I can feel it!  @MarcoRubio: According to various #Florida hospitals their primary concern at this point is not bed capacity, it's that the increased community spread could lead to an increase in staff community exposure/infection result in a potential staffing level crisis.

State and federal law already prevent health insurance providers from demanding customers hand over the results of their DNA tests like 23andMe or AncestryDNA. But the new law (HB 1189) will add those protections for the three additional types of insurance. House Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls spearheaded that effort to patch a prospective problem he envisioned when he was applying for life insurance. While he was on hold on the telephone waiting for assistance, the Clearwater Republican said he was struck by advertisements from genetic testing companies encouraging people to buy tests.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sprowls-1.9.20.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sprowls-1.9.20.jpg</url> Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed Chris Sprowls' DNA privacy bill.; Breaking overnight   'Governor eases regulations on occupational licenses[6]' via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics   DeSantis signed off on the Occupational Freedom and Opportunity Act, easing regulations on licensed practitioners of a wide swath of occupations ranging from body wrapping to boxing announcing. Auctioneers, barbers, electrical contractors, and geologists will have fewer education requirements, with nutritionists, interior designers, landscape architects, nutritionists, accountants, and alarm system installers seeing some licensing requirements eliminated completely. The bill allows for reciprocal licensing from different states. The bill also clears the way for food trucks to operate with impunity statewide, eliminating the fights in many jurisdictions the industry has faced. 'New law requires sea-level impact study for publicly-funded coastal projects[7]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   DeSantis signed off on legislation requiring publicly-funded coastal project contractors to study nearby environmental effects before building can begin. Democratic Sen. Jos Javier Rodrguez backed the bill while Republican Rep. Vance Aloupis supported the House version. Both lawmakers represent portions of Miami-Dade County. 'In a state where more than two-thirds of the population lives near the coast, requiring planning when state taxpayer dollars are spent on infrastructure in the coastal zone is a necessary and long overdue initial step in addressing the impacts of climate,' Rodrguez said Tuesday. The law does not take effect immediately. Rather, it tasks the Department of Environmental Protection with developing the standard for the newly-required sea level impact projection study. 'Ron DeSantis signs Clean Waterways Act[8]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics   DeSantis has signed the Clean Waterways Act, part of the Governor's latest efforts on environmental protection. The act, which the Governor called 'probably the most comprehensive bill we've seen in quite some time' during a ceremonial signing in Juno Beach, implements several recommendations from the Blue-Green Algae Task Force. Of those recommendations in the priority legislation are improvements to septic systems, stormwater and agriculture runoff. In addition to allowing the Department of Environmental Protection to preemptively inspect the treatment systems, it would transfer septic tank inspection from the Department of Health to DEP, prioritizing environmental health alongside human health. 'DeSantis signs parental consent for abortion into law[9]' via Jim Saunders of the Tallahassee Democrat   DeSantis signed a bill that will require parental consent before minors can have abortions, a long-sought goal of abortion opponents in Florida. DeSantis did not make a public statement about the bill signing, but Senate President Galvano, and other supporters praised the measure and said parents need to be involved when their underage daughters consider having abortions. 'The serious and irrevocable decision to end a pregnancy involves undergoing a significant medical procedure that results, in many cases, in lifelong emotional and physical impacts,' Galvano said in a prepared statement. 'DeSantis signs off on Joe Gruters, Randy Fine sewage fine hike[10]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   Fines for sewage spills, including from public utility systems, will soon increase significantly. DeSantis signed legislation Tuesday at a Juno Beach ceremony with sponsors Gruters and Fine. The lawmakers said protecting Florida's water remained a chief priority for state government. 'Florida is not Florida without its abundant natural waterways. Water is at the heart of the state's terrific quality of life, and what makes tourism the backbone of our economy,' Gruters said. Fine said few missions are more important.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fine-gruters-.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/fine-gruters-.jpg</url> Randy Fine and Joe Gruters get a win on bigger fines for municipal sewage leaks. 'DeSantis kills online learning program amid virus resurgence[11]' via Andrew Atterbury of POLITICO Florida   With a stroke of his veto pen, DeSantis wiped out the entire $29.4 million budget for a suite of online education services that have become critical to students and faculty during the COVID-19 outbreak. The move, barring action before midnight Tuesday, will kill the Complete Florida Plus Program, an array of technology systems that faculty, staff and students throughout Florida rely on, never more so than now, in the midst of a pandemic that has amplified reliance on distance learning. At least 2,000 adult learners could be cut off from their scholarships and school accreditation could even be at risk without the resources housed under Complete Florida, which are used by students at high schools, state colleges and universities. 'DeSantis signs Alyssa's Law to require panic alarms in Florida schools[12]' via Lisa J. Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   In the school year that starts 2021, every teacher and school staffer in Florida will be able to quietly and quickly tap their cellphone or computer to summon the police. This safeguard will be the result of a new law signed by Florida's governor Tuesday in honor of one of the students killed in the 2018 Parkland high school massacre. Alyssa's Law mandates that mobile panic buttons installed on every teacher and staff's cellphone as an app or as computer software to be programmed to silently alert law enforcement to emergencies or life-threatening situations on all public and charter school campuses. 'Automated pill kiosks now permitted at pharmacies after Governor's signature[13]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   DeSantis has signed legislation allowing pharmacies to dispense medication through ATM-like kiosks. Those kiosks are already permitted at facilities such as long-term care homes and prisons. The machines will not dole out controlled substances, which can be addicting and are subject to more strict oversight. Democratic Rep. Matt Willhite sponsored the House version of the bill, which ultimately passed. Some Democratic Senators, such as Bill Montford, worried the machines could crowd out smaller pharmacies. Proponents of the measure pointed to the limited drugs available in the kiosks, arguing there would still be room for rural pharmacies. 'Governor lights path for organ transplant discrimination remedies[14]' via Renzo Downey of Florida Politics   DeSantis is doubling down on the rights of Floridians with disabilities to receive organ transplants with a bill he signed Monday evening. Legislation carried by Jacksonville-area Republicans Rep. Jason Fischer and Sen. Aaron Bean prevents health care facilities, insurers and other entities from denying organ transplant services to people with developmental or intellectual disabilities solely because of that disability. 'A lot of times, we don't know because people didn't know their remedy,' Bean told Florida Politics. The bill outlines a framework in state law for people to seek recourse. 'DeSantis signs bill accommodating persons with pets in emergency shelters[15]' via Jason Delgado of Florida Politics   DeSantis signed a bill into law Monday that will require counties with designated emergency shelters to designate a shelter for persons with pets. The bill would also require the Department of Education to play a part in strategizing evacuation for persons with pets in the state comprehensive emergency management plan. The bill is intended to put Florida in line with the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, which mandates state and local governments to consider persons with pets in their emergency preparedness plans and authorizes FEMA to provide rescue, care, shelter and essential needs to persons with pets and service animals following an emergency such as a natural disaster.   CORONA BUDGET   'Escambia and Santa Rosa see $5.65 million in cuts from DeSantis veto pen[16]' via Jim Little and Annie Blanks of the Pensacola News Journal   DeSantis signed Florida's $92.2 billion budget after carving out more than $1 billion in line-item vetoes to programs and projects across the state as it braces for a hit to its revenue from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Local programs and projects in the Pensacola area saw at least a $5.65 million slashed from DeSantis' veto pen from what the Legislature approved earlier this year. DeSantis noted that more than $550 million of the cuts came from his own initiatives, and that the state was facing an unprecedented situation with its economy.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-6.29.20-19.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HACKLEY-BUDGET-6.29.20-19.jpg</url> Ron DeSantis' veto pen hit some communities hard.

'DeSantis' budget cuts include $4 million intended to go to Treasure Coast[17]' via Joshua Solomon of TC Palm   The local reductions, attributed to shortfalls from the coronavirus pandemic, were a part of $1 billion of final cuts, which focused mainly on reducing funds for affordable housing, social services and education. On the Treasure Coast, funding for seven specific projects was slashed, but the overall $1 billion of cuts is expected to result in a reduction of services here, as well. The largest local project vetoed by DeSantis was a $2.3 million planned extension of Hegener Drive in Port St. Lucie. The project is intended to create more jobs in the Southern Grove jobs corridor. The city had planned to match the state funds with $1 million of its own money. The half-mile road, if built, is expected to open access to 106 acres in Tradition. 'TBARTA iced in Florida budget after unprecedented cuts[18]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   The Tampa Bay Area Regional Transit Authority will not be receiving the $1.5 million originally approved in the budget to keep its wheels in motion. DeSantis vetoed the funding as part of his $1.66 million cut, the largest ever in Florida history. Rep. Jackie Toledo filed HB 2483 along with an appropriations request for the funding, which was originally included in the more than $93 million budget. It would have paid for a nearly $300,000 salary and benefits package for TBARTA Executive Director David Green. It also would have included more than $987,000 for additional staff salaries and benefits. 'Cure Violence survives Ron DeSantis vetoes but KIPP charter school loses funding[19]' via David Bauerlein of the Florida Times-Union   DeSantis left standing $500,000 for expanding the Cure Violence program in Jacksonville and $3 million to help build a new youth sports complex in Clay County. Line items wiped out by DeSantis vetoes included $2 million for the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) charter school in Jacksonville that had been untouchable in previous budgets when it came to vetoes. The state support for Cure Violence will allow Jacksonville to enlarge its reach to cover to a third area of Jacksonville as the city continues to face a wave of homicides. Cure Violence treats violent crime as it were a public health epidemic whose spread can be slowed and constrained.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KIPP-Jacksonville-Campus-With-Skyline-scaled.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KIPP-Jacksonville-Campus-With-Skyline-scaled.jpg</url> Once untouchable, KIPP Jacksonville gets the cold shoulder in the 2020-21 budget. 'UF Lastinger Center funds vetoed from budget[20]' via Florida Politics staff reports   A $1 million appropriation for the University of Florida's Lastinger Center was nixed from the state budget as part of more than $1 billion in vetoes. The funding was set aside for the 'Algebra Nation: Statewide Digital Match Enhancement Program' at the center, which researches new methods for teaching and improving learning outcomes. This is the second straight year the center was included in the budget sent to the Governor's desk but failed to survive the veto pen. In the 2019 Session, the Senate included $2 million for the center in its sprinkle list. His veto doesn't cancel the program, but it does leave it unfunded for the upcoming budget year, which begins July 1.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perspecta.com/transformation\">https://www.perspecta.com/transformation</url>CORONAFLORIDA   'DeSantis extends moratorium on evictions just hours before it would have expired[21]' via Steven Lemongello and Caroline Glenn of the Orlando Sentinel   Hours after the dodging the question, DeSantis night extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures until Aug. 1 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The moratorium, ordered by the governor on April 2, was scheduled to end at midnight. Without it, thousands of Floridians would have faced becoming homeless within days because landlords across the state have already filed the court paperwork necessary to remove tenants in anticipation of the order's end. Since April, at least 2,672 evictions have been filed in courts in counties across the state. Once the moratorium has expired, courts will be able to again begin processing cases.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2315-1-scaled.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2315-1-scaled.jpeg</url> Housing activists place eviction order near the entrance of the Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee.

'Florida tops 150,000 coronavirus cases[22]' via Jane Musgrave of The Palm Beach Post   Florida continued racking up record-setting numbers of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, with 6,093 new cases reported, pushing the state's total to 152,434, according to the Florida Department of Health. It is the seventh straight day that the number of new cases has jumped by more than 5,000. While far less than the 9,585 new diagnoses that were reported on Saturday, it is well above the numbers that were reported in May that prompted DeSantis to reopen businesses. For the entire month of June, an average of 3,209 new cases were added to state tallies each day. In May, an average of 725 new cases were reported daily. DeSantis has steadfastly refused to issue a statewide order requiring people to wear masks. 'As Florida begins third reopened month, future clouded by rising COVID-19 cases[23]' via John Kennedy of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune   As Florida braced for beginning its third month of an economic reopening, another 6,093 new coronavirus cases were added to a toll that has spiked sharply over the past week. The climbing caseload has many questioning not only the response of DeSantis and state health officials to the virus but also just how long reopening can endure in its current form. 'We're telling our members to mandate masks, do everything above and beyond just so we're not next' for shutdown, said Carol Dover, president and CEO of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.

Those numbers were up from 89 workers and 85 youths in a Friday count. Palm Beach Youth Academy has had the most cases, with 21 youths and 11 workers testing positive. The Department of Juvenile Justice said Tuesday that 17 of the facility's youths were no longer in medical isolation, and 10 of the workers had been medically cleared to return to their jobs. In all, 45 of the 100 workers who have tested positive have been medically cleared. Meanwhile, 66 of the 93 youths are no longer in medical isolation. Assignment editors   U.S. Rep.

'DeSantis vetoed affordable housing funds, but there's aid for people impacted by COVID-19[28]' via Rene Rodriguez, Yadira Lopez and Mary Ellen Klas of the Miami Herald   For the first time in a decade, Florida legislators left funds earmarked for affordable housing intact rather than diverting them into a general-purpose slush fund. But $225 million of the designated monies still won't go to housing, at least for now. DeSantis vetoed $225 million from the Sadowski funds, more than half the total $340 million allocated, essentially freezing the money until legislators come back into Session this fall and vote on an amended budget. That won't happen until after the general election on November 3.

'Visitors will see a big change on Key West's Duval Street during the holiday weekend[31]' via Gwen Filosa of the Miami Herald   Even with beaches and bars closed, Key West still expects crowds this Fourth of July weekend. And they're expected to converge on Duval Street at a time when the Florida Keys are hitting daily record highs in new cases of the novel coronavirus. How can the city help to ensure social distancing? To start, city leaders said they will close most of Duval to cars and turn it into a pedestrian-only walkway for this weekend. That means only pedestrians may use Duval, spreading out into the street. This Fourth of July weekend will have limitations throughout the Keys, along with the historically heavy traffic on U.S. 1. But city leaders say they are ready. 'No plan to close the Keys[32]' via Timothy O'Hara of Keys News   The Florida Keys may be seeing record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, but there are no immediate plans to shut down the Florida Keys to visitors or erect new checkpoints limiting entrance.

The shutdown includes the 'Fills' area near Indian Key, which is a popular destination for Miami-Dade County residents who enjoy picnicking, barbecuing, swimming and boating there. The village announced Tuesday that the entire area, from mile marker 77.5 to 79.8, will be off limits to parking, tents, chairs and other items, which will be welcome news to many village residents who are often left to clean up the mess left on the roadside beaches following busy weekends. 'Duval County Public Schools unanimously approve use of protective barriers in the classroom[34]' via The Florida Times-Union   Tuesday the Duval County School Board unanimously approved the use of protective barriers to help separate students during the upcoming school year. The district has already spent about $10.2 million since April 1 on coronavirus-reactive measures. That includes the cost incurred to move the district to distance learning in March. At least $9 million of that has gone to items labeled GSA, which covers the district's bus vendor. Vendors have been delivering meals and instructional packets. Members of the School Board and the district said all of the plans laid out in recent weeks could change at a moment's notice as the number of COVID-19 infections and local mandates continues to fluctuate.

After discussing it for hours, only one county commissioner, Henry Dean, wanted a mandatory indoor mask policy. The other four did not second the motion. While they're not required in the county, they are still required in indoor public buildings in St. Augustine city limits. 'I don't think anyone has the answers today to provide a definitive answer that will be effective, will be enforced and will protect everybody,' Commissioner Jimmy Johns said.

The U.S. has set records for daily new infections in recent days as outbreaks surge mostly across the South and West. The recent spike in new cases has outpaced daily infections in April when the virus rocked Washington state and the northeast, and when public officials thought the outbreak was hitting its peak in the U.S. The sheer size of the U.S. and the fact that the virus is hitting different parts of the country at different times complicates the public response here compared with other countries.

Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, urged Trump to wear a face mask 'when it's appropriate' to help end the political debate over wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Studies show that wearing masks can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, but efforts to encourage mask-wearing have been complicated by political partisanship and distrust in public health advice. Nationally, the percentage of Democrats who reported wearing a mask all the time when leaving home rose from 49% between April 10 and May 4 to 65% between May 8 and June 22.

Less than half, 46%, of patients with COVID-19 who were surveyed by the agency reported known close contact with infected people in the two weeks leading up to their own diagnoses. At 45%, family members topped the list of reported prior known contacts, followed by work colleagues at 34%. The findings came from a telephone survey between April 15 and May 24 of 350 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 at one of 11 academic medical centers. 'U.S. pediatricians call for in-person school this fall[41]' via Anya Kamenetz of NPR   The nation's pediatricians have come out with a strong statement in favor of bringing children back to the classroom this fall wherever and whenever they can do so safely. The guidance says 'schools are fundamental to child and adolescent development and well-being.' The AAP cites 'mounting evidence' that transmission of the coronavirus by young children is uncommon, partly because they are less likely to contract it in the first place. On the other hand, the AAP argues that based on the nation's experience this spring, remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. 'Millions track the pandemic on Johns Hopkins's dashboard. Those who built it say some miss the real story.[42]' via Kyle Swenson of The Washington Post   Since launching in January, Johns Hopkins' Coronavirus Resource Center has exploded in scope and popularity, garnering millions of page views and popping up in news coverage and daily conversation. Through numbers, the tracker has told the story of what the virus is doing while the story is still unfolding, offering a nearly real-time picture of its silent march across the globe. But even as data has jumped to the forefront of international discussions about the virus, the Johns Hopkins team wrestles with doubts about whether the numbers can truly capture the scope of the pandemic, and whether the public and policymakers are failing to absorb the big picture.   CORONA ECONOMICS   'Top CEOs say business fallout from coronavirus will extend through 2021[43]' via Hannah Denham of The Washington Post   The chief executives of some of the nation's largest companies expect the ill economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic to extend through 2021, and nearly a third of them say the harm will last even longer. The CEO Economic Outlook Survey fell to 34.3 in the second quarter, the lowest reading for the composite index since the same three months of 2009. But it's well above the all-time low of -5.0, set during the first quarter of 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. Public health concerns continue to weigh on the economy as coronavirus infections surged last week in several states, promoting some to roll back their reopening timelines. 'A national mask mandate could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion, Goldman Sachs says[44]' via Sarah Hansen of Forbes   As mask-wearing becomes a political flashpoint new research from Goldman Sachs suggests a national mask mandate would slow the growth rate of new coronavirus infections and prevent a 5% GDP loss caused by additional lockdown measures. Goldman's analysts found that wearing face coverings has a significant impact on coronavirus outcomes, and they suggest that a federal mask mandate would 'meaningfully' increase mask usage across the country, especially in states like Florida and Texas, where masks are not currently required. Reducing the spread of the virus through mask-wearing, the analysts found, could be a substitute for strict lockdown measures that would otherwise shave 5%, or $1 trillion, off the U.S. GDP. 'Paycheck Protection Program wraps up with $130 billion left unused, and lawmakers eye next steps[45]' via Jonathan O'Connell, Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg of The Washington Post   With the deadline to apply for the Paycheck Protection Program ending Tuesday night at midnight, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin have led a group considering how best to use the remaining funds to help small businesses as they begin to reopen. The issue is not expected to be resolved, however, until the Senate gets to work in late July on what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said will be the final major coronavirus relief bill. At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration supports legislation to re-purpose the more than $130 billion left in the small-business fund. Tweet, tweet: I have no objection to extending the #PPP[46] deadline until August 8th.  But the vast majority of #SmallBusiness[47] that wanted to benefit from the program have already used it.  What we really need to pass very soon is targeted help for those who need a second round of aid.

As campuses announce plans to reopen in the fall, service workers, many of whom are people of color, have been summoned to the front lines. Maintenance workers and custodial crews are being called back to work with little preparation, their union says. Faculty, staff and students will be asked to report their temperatures daily, and many officials say they want to make testing available to employees who want it.  'European Union says it will bar Americans when bloc reopens to international visitors July 1[50]' via Julia Thompson and Deirdre Shesgreen of USA Today   Americans will not be allowed to travel to European Union countries when the bloc opens up to international visitors July 1, the European Council announced. Travelers from 14 countries will be welcomed to the EU, including Canada, South Korea and Australia. But those from the U.S. and many other nations will be barred as too risky because of spiking coronavirus cases in their home countries. The criteria used to decide whether to lift pandemic travel restrictions were based on the epidemiological situation and containment measures in each country.   MORE CORONA   'There is no safe way to reopen colleges this fall[51]' via Shweta Bansal, Colin Carlson and John Kraemer of The Washington Post   Universities across the country are announcing their intention to resume in-person classes despite the ongoing threat of a pandemic including some recent high-profile decisions. Colleges are proposing solutions like residential pods in dorms to balance physical distancing with the need for social contact or digital apps that trade-off privacy for contact tracing. These ideas could provide more flexibility in the future. Every way we approach the question of whether universities can resume on-campus classes, basic epidemiology shows there is no way to 'safely' reopen by the fall semester. If students are returned to campus for face-to-face instruction, the risk of significant on-campus COVID-19 transmission will be unmanageably and unavoidably high. 'California prison officials transferred inmates in an attempt to stop an outbreak. It backfired, badly.[52]' via The New York Times   An effort by California officials to halt the spread of the virus at a prison in Chino backfired and caused a massive outbreak inside San Quentin, the state's oldest and best-known prison. Late last month, 121 prisoners from the California Institution for Men in Chino, which had nearly 700 cases and nine deaths, were bused to San Quentin, where no inmates were known to have the virus. Now more than 1,000 of the 3,700 prisoners at San Quentin have been infected. A hearing is scheduled in the state Senate, where lawmakers say they have become alarmed about the outbreak and what they describe as a haphazard response by prison officials. 'Minor league baseball's 2020 season canceled[53]' via Jenna West of Sports Illustrated   Minor League Baseball's 2020 season has been canceled, the league announced. The announcement came after MLB informed its affiliated MiLB teams that it would not be providing players in 2020. 'These are unprecedented times for our country and our organization as this is the first time in our history that we've had a summer without Minor League Baseball,' said MiLB president and CEO Pat O'Conner. The long-awaited news came as no surprise after people across the industry anticipated the season would not take place.  'The new corporate swag: Branded masks, sanitizer spray bottles and Zoom vanity light rings[54]' via Jena McGregor of The Washington Post   As some businesses reopen and others try to stay in touch with employees working from home, companies are opting for coronavirus-related corporate swag, branded sanitizer bottles, 'clean key' tools for pressing elevator buttons and, above all, masks, joining the tote bags, travel mugs and USB flash drives that have long defined company giveaways. Some companies, such as Dunkin' and Bloomingdale's, are selling face coverings with brands, distinctive colors, or catchphrases directly to consumers, and some companies offer them to front-line employees in service jobs. Speaking of which:'The COVID 15: Lockdowns are lifting, and our clothes don't fit[55]' via Suzanne Kapner of The Wall Street Journal   People spent the spring sheltering at home in sweatpants, perfecting banana bread recipes and indulging in pandemic-induced stress-eating. Most of them escaped COVID-19, but not the 'COVID 15' what people are calling the quarantine weight gain pushing Americans into roomier wardrobes just as lockdowns lift. Google searches for 'elastic waist' spiked in recent weeks. Body-measuring apps are reporting a jump in people redoing their profiles and choosing looser fits. Some retailers say they are increasing orders of bigger sizes.  SMOLDERING   'NBA, union plan to paint 'Black Lives Matter' on courts in Orlando[56]' via Zach Lowe and Ramona Shelburne of ESPN  The NBA and National Basketball Players Association are planning to paint 'Black Lives Matter' on the court inside both sidelines in all three arenas the league will use at the Walt Disney World Resort when it resumes the 2019-20 season late next month in Orlando, Florida. The WNBA is also discussing painting 'Black Lives Matter' on the court when it begins its abbreviated 2020 season at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Sources also said some WNBA players have suggested in talks with league higher-ups that players wear warm-up shirts with 'Say Her Name' on them in an attempt to keep attention on female victims of police brutality. 'It's time for bold moves. The NBA should put victims' names on jersey fronts.[57]' via Jerry Brewer of The Washington Post   If the novel coronavirus allows the NBA to return as planned in late July, the league should come back with the strongest symbol it can offer about an incessant American tragedy. WNBA star Angel McCoughtry proposed the idea of using the jersey as a potent Black Lives Matter emblem, and now it has made it onto the NBA's table. During the opening games of the NBA restart, when the 22 remaining teams take the court again, the opportunity exists for a heart-wrenching spectacle that would enhance all of the other messaging. 'Fort Lauderdale cop charged with battery for shoving protester[58]' via Mario Ariza and Andrew Boryga of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Steven Pohorence, the embattled Fort Lauderdale police officer accused of shoving a kneeling protester during a Black Lives Matters protest, has been charged with battery. The Broward State Attorney's Office filed the charge in response to the May 31 incident in which Pohorence shoved Jada Servance as she knelt on the ground during a tense exchange between officers and demonstrators. According to her attorney, Servance suffered neck and shoulder injuries. The charging documents allege that Pohorence committed battery by 'actually and intentionally touching or striking' Servance against her will. Pohorence's attorney, Michael Dutko, said a video of the encounter might not tell the whole story.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ft-lauderdale-knee.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ft-lauderdale-knee.jpg</url>Ft. Lauderdale police officer Steven Pohorence is being charged with battery after shoving a protester.;; 'A 'coup' led by White supremacists led to placement of Pensacola's Confederate monument[59]' via Jim Little of the Pensacola News Journal   Pensacola's monument was an example of a 'Lost Cause' monument and the first monument to not just soldiers of the war but Confederate leaders at a time when the 'Lost Cause' narrative was galvanizing the public's memory of the war. The warping of history with things like the Confederate monument while the civil rights of Blacks were suppressed and the creation of a segregated society for nearly 80 years, allowed for the creation of systemic racism that is the focus of modern protests. The monument was thought to be such a part of Pensacola that when a debate erupted in the 1960s about having Palafox Street cut through the middle of the square, a city council member suggested building a tunnel under the monument rather than disturb it. 'Vandals deface Confederate monument in Pensacola's Lee Square[60]' via the Pensacola News Journal staff reports   Pensacola police are investigating the vandalism of the Confederate Monument in downtown Pensacola overnight. Vandals spray-painted what appears to be 'Your Confederate Dead' on one side of the monument and threw a bucket of red paint on another side. Mike Wood, a spokesman for the Pensacola Police Department, said the paint was first discovered by police in the early hours of Tuesday morning. In recent weeks, PPD officers have been directed to routinely survey all the monuments and statues within Pensacola's city limits as a part of their daily duties and night patrols. According to law enforcement, if police identify and arrest a suspect in connection to the vandalism, the accused would face a charge of criminal mischief. 'Pinellas commissioners disagree over 'Black Lives Matter' Zoom background[61]' via Mark Puente of the Tampa Bay Times   Is the Black Lives Matter mural in St. Petersburg an appropriate backdrop for a government meeting? The question arose Tuesday at the end of the Pinellas County Commission meeting when Commissioner Kathleen Peters questioned the backgrounds that commissioners and administrators use during online meetings, specifically the background used by Commissioner Ken Welch. Welch's background was a photo of the Black Lives Matter mural on the street in front of the Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American Museum in St. Petersburg. Welch also used a Black Lives Matter photo as a backdrop last week during a meeting. A group of local artists collaborated this month to paint the mural for the city's Juneteenth celebration. Peters said she has received complaints from constituents about Welch's mural background. Meanwhile 'Woman shot multiple times after being dared to steal Nazi flag from front yard[62]' via Austin Breasette of KFOR   A 26-year-old woman was shot multiple times early Sunday morning after she was dared to steal a swastika flag from a Hunter man's front yard. Garfield County Sheriff's deputies responded to a shots-fired call at 3 a.m. Sunday. When they got on scene they found a woman lying in a ditch. 'The female had multiple gunshot wounds, so my deputies rendered aid to her,' Jody Helm, Garfield County Sheriff said. According to the Sheriff, she was dared to try and steal one of the two swastika flags that hang in a neighbor's front yard. So, she ran over to do it. 'On the way back someone hollered gun,' Helm said. 'She dropped the flag at the end of the driveway and shots were fired.' 'Who's the most galling, captivating character on our screens this summer? It's Karen   and she's everywhere.[63]' via Hank Stuever of The Washington Post   Several times a day, Instagram and Twitter feeds serve up another galling, sad and often an intensely satisfying segment of a reality series we can just go ahead and call 'Karens,' in which women make the mistake of policing, harassing or discriminating against their fellow humans in public. As soon as one Karen flames out across the internet, another apparently more unhinged Karen rises in her place. Now, with the cameras squarely and vigilantly in the hands of those who are sick of being hassled, the 'Karens' show depressingly confirms some of our worst suspicions about people in general, wielding a similar power of stereotype.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/karen.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/karen.jpg</url> In the latest viral 'Karen' incident, homeowners brandish weapons as they confront protesters marching to the St. Louis Mayor's house.

MATTERS   'Republicans have been skipping House Intelligence meetings for months[64]' via Martin Matishak of POLITICO   Democrats see a boycott motivated by partisan politics. Republicans argue they have legitimate security concerns. Either way, GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee have skipped all but one of the panel's proceedings, public and private, since before Congress went into its coronavirus-lockdown in early March. And that impasse shows no signs of ending. Democrats see it as yet another manifestation of the toxic partisan split dividing the panel during Trump's presidency, in contrast to the still-bipartisan spirit that prevails on the Senate Intelligence Committee.   POLITICAL MERCENARIES   A hefty price tag to retain the lobbying services of a former member of Congress poses no problem for foreign governments like the Saudis   especially given what they get in return. As part of a nine-month investigation, Noah Pransky of NBCLX[65] found several examples such as former Rep. Buck McKeon of California. In his second career as a foreign agent, McKeon initially brought in $50,000 a month   as well as a $450,000 check from the kingdom just days after what was believed to be the Saudi-sponsored murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi of The Washington Post.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mckeon.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Mckeon.jpg</url> Former Rep. Buck McKeon of California has a lucrative second career as a foreign agent lobbying Congress on behalf of the Saudis. Mercenaryism by former members of Congress might raise eyebrows in the communities they once were elected to serve, but not in Washington, where lobbying on behalf of foreign entities is commonplace. An examination of official records shows that over the past five years, more than 50 former members of the House and Senate worked for foreign interests   including Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. Foreign nations cannot send campaign donations directly to U.S. politicians, but they certainly can have lobbyists do so on their behalf. While the Constitution and federal laws prohibit foreign powers from spending money to influence American elections or give anything of value to elected officials, there's nothing stopping them from spending hundreds of millions of dollars to influence American policies by hiring well-connected lobbyists. One such agent   former Rep. Porter Goss of Florida   held up his Foreign Agents Registration Act (enacted in 1938 to prevent Nazi infiltration of American politics) disclosures as proof the system provides sufficient transparency. Others acknowledged FARA relies too much on former members' honesty and ethical boundaries. Most remain tight-lipped about their involvement[66]. Former Florida lawmakers who are among the 50 or so former members of Congress[67] now acting as foreign agents include Goss, Wexler, James Bacchus, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Connie Mack IV,Jeff Miller, and Robert Wexler.

'Disney ruling could save hotel companies millions in taxes[70]' via Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel   Walt Disney World and the lodging industry lobby just won a sweeping legal victory that could save Disney and other big hotel owners millions of dollars in taxes. Ruling in a yearslong lawsuit between Disney and Orange County Property Appraiser Rick Singh, an appellate court determined that Singh's office improperly inflated the value of Disney's Yacht Beach Club Resort, a luxury hotel with an annual property tax bill of more than $4 million. But attorneys and appraisers say the decision, which was issued June 19, will reverberate far beyond that one hotel. That's because the court declared the entire method that Singh had used to appraise the Disney property, a method that is widely used by other property appraisers, is illegal under Florida law. 'Former Seminole Tax Collector Greenberg pleads not guilty to federal charges[71]' via Martin E.

'Miami businessmen, others charged in $1.4 billion health insurance scam in Florida[73]' via Jay Weaver of the Miami Herald   In one of Florida's biggest health care schemes, 10 business people from Miami and elsewhere have been charged with submitting $1.4 billion in bogus bills for urinalysis and blood tests through rural hospitals. An indictment charges the defendants with bilking Florida Blue and other private insurance companies, which paid out $400 million for tests that were actually done by private labs instead of the rural hospitals. In doing so, the defendants were able to boost their reimbursements because the rural hospitals qualified for higher insurance payments between 2015 and 2018. 'Miami-Dade Commissioner colludes with rail executive to do away with beach connector RFP[74]' via Peter Schorsch of Florida Politics   As we reported two weeks ago, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner may have violated the County's Cone of Silence Ordinance during a discussion on the Beach Corridor Trunk Line RFP held on at the County Commission meeting June 2. In recent days Florida Politics has become aware of that the Miami-Dade Commission on Ethics has opened an investigation into this matter and in less than a week, found that no violation had taken place by either Commissioner Joe Martinez or Jitendra Tomar, the representative for the rail company CAF. This is surprising not only due to the speed with which the COE acted, but with the rush, they may have missed critical evidence that would show possible wrongdoing.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/21319joemartinez.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/21319joemartinez.png</url> Miami-Dade Commissioner Joe Martinez possibly violated the county's Cone of Silence rules.

Records show the spill began on June 17 but Longboat Key did not publicly report the issue until Monday, nearly two weeks later. The spill's cause has yet to be determined and cleanup will be conducted once the release is stopped.

But political strategists in both parties agree that Biden is the one who had benefited so far. A Biden strategy of caution and discipline, which has limited his travel and put news conferences on hold for 88 days, has allowed the Democrat to keep the national focus on Trump and his polarizing approach to the coronavirus pandemic, the economic crisis and widespread fury over racist policing practices. Biden has made no secret of his own thinking on the matter. 'The more that Donald Trump is out the worse he does. I think it is wonderful that he goes out,' Biden joked.

'Marco Rubio endorses Dane Eagle in CD 19[84]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   Rubio knows which Southwest Florida candidate he wants to join him in Congress, endorsing Eagle in Florida's 19th Congressional District. 'The 21st-century challenges facing our nation are unprecedented, and we need leaders in Congress who know how to get results,' Rubio said. 'As Republican Majority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives, Dane has proved time and time again his commitment to our conservative values, and his principles and track record of results make him the most qualified person in this race. I am proud to endorse Dane Eagle for Congress, and I look forward to working with him on behalf of all Floridians and our country.' Eagle is one of nine Republicans running to succeed retiring Rep. Francis Rooney.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rubio-Eagle.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rubio-Eagle.jpg</url> Big get: Marco Rubio is endorsing Dane Eagle for Congress. 'A lawsuit to kick Carlos Gimnez off the ballot for Congress continues   for now[85]' via Alex Daugherty of the Miami Herald   A one-letter typo led to a two-month legal fight between Gimnez and firefighter Omar Blanco, and the dispute that began with a misspelled check now has Blanco accusing Gimnez of using illegal funds to qualify for the ballot in Florida's 26th Congressional District. The back-and-forth will continue, at least for now, after a Florida judge denied Gimnez's motion to dismiss Blanco's lawsuit last week. Blanco is competing with Gimnez in the Republican primary in August. The winner will face incumbent U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcarsel-Powell, a Democrat, who represents a district that includes western Miami-Dade County, Homestead and the Florida Keys. SD 27 text campaign targets Wilton Simpson, Kathleen Passidomo   The SD 27 Republican primary between Reps. Heather Fitzenhagen and Ray Rodrigues is already getting dirty. As reported by Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida, an unknown party has been blasting text messages in the district that criticize Senate President-Designate Wilton Simpson and Senate Majority Leader Kathleen Passidomo, both of whom are backing Rodrigues in the primary. Axiom Strategies, a political consulting firm hired by Fitzenhagen, flatly denied the messages came from her camp. 'Heather and her campaign have absolutely nothing   zero   to do with the texts, and she's getting them just like everyone else,' said Lyndsey Blagrave, an Axiom consultant serving as Fitzenhagen's campaign spokesperson. 'NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer locks sights on Heather Fitzenhagen[86]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics   Hammer, Florida's leading gun rights advocate, has turned her sights on the Senate District 27. She's focused on stopping Fitzenhagen's fledgling candidacy. In multiple emails sent to National Rifle Association members and other Second Amendment advocates, she portrays Fitzenhagen as a traitor to conservatives. She ties the sitting House member to incoming Senate Democratic Leader Gary Farmer, asserting the Democrat has Fitzenhagen's vote for Senate President. Fitzenhagen called the emails dishonest and inaccurate. 'As far as guns go, I have a strong record in the House,' Fitzenhagen said. 'I don't know where this is coming from, but it is again complete fiction,' she said.

Porras, an immigration attorney, is competing against former HD 105 candidate Javier Estevez for the Democratic nomination. 'Maureen has a proven record of standing up for justice and human rights,' Shaw said Tuesday. 'She has used her voice to defend others and to elevate important issues facing the community. She has clear and workable solutions to protect Floridians and reform our broken systems. Now more than ever, Maureen is the fighter and leader that we need in Tallahassee.' Shaw previously represented House District 61, which covers parts of Hillsborough County. He then competed in the 2018 Attorney General contest, losing to Republican candidate Ashley Moody. ''Miami turf war' roils Republicans[89]' via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida   Outgoing House Speaker Jos Oliva has sparked a Miami clash with statewide implications after his fellow Republicans accused him of helping to fund negative ads against a Miami lawmaker in line to be a future speaker of the Florida House. Oliva did not address rumors that he was trying to knock Rep. Daniel Perez out of his primary race. South Florida's legislative delegation is notoriously fractious. 'It feels like a classic Miami turf war, and the current speaker wants to be the most powerful guy from Miami,' said a Republican familiar with the brewing scuffle. 'This is literally all ego.' 'Eric Holder's redistricting PAC backs four Florida House candidates, pledges $124K for those races[90]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a pro-Democratic PAC chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, is endorsing four Florida House candidates and committing $124,000 to those races. The announcement came as the NDRC committed to backing 102 Democratic candidates in states across the country. The group has also pledged approximately $2 million to those races. To that end, the NDRC is endorsing Kayser Enneking in House District 21, Franccesca Cesti-Browne in House District 115, Ricky Junquera in House District 118 and Clint Barras in House District 120.   DOWN BALLOT   'Miami-Dade mayoral race goes negative as group drops attack ads against Esteban Bovo, Xavier Suarez[91]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   A new group is releasing a pair of advertisements hitting Bovo over his association with David Rivera. Rivera has been in hot water after news broke his consulting firm, Interamerican Consulting, agreed to a $50 million deal with a Venezuelan oil company while it was controlled by the Nicols Maduro regime. Bovo has since taken steps to distance himself from Rivera. A group called A Better Miami Dade is still going after Bovo in a 30-second Spanish-language ad highlighting those ties. Bovo's mayoral campaign returned a $1,000 donation from Interamerican Consulting after The New York Times reported on the $50 million deal. Bovo also ended his relationship with the fundraiser in question, Esther Nuhfer.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/86284778_204656710937040_8903962611905724416_n.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/86284778_204656710937040_8903962611905724416_n.jpg</url> Esteban Steve Bovo is on the defense after attack ads hit blasting his association with David Rivera. Image via Facebook. 'One ad attacks Alex Penelas, the other defends him. Both trace back to same D.C. staffer[92]' via Douglas Hanks of the Miami Herald   On Friday, some Miami-Dade voters received text messages linking to a political committee's website accusing county mayor candidate Alex Penelas of being part of a 'carousel of corruption' when he held the job in the 1990s and 2000s. Days later, a different committee was circulating a television ad urging voters to ignore the 'lies' about Penelas, a former mayor who 'cracked down on corruption.' The messages were funded by political committees led by Carlos Condarco, a lawyer active in local Democratic politics and press secretary to Miami Congresswoman Donna Shalala. 'Judicial candidate Kevin Alvarez's campaign has hit rock bottom   and he's starting to dig[93]' via Peter Schorsch of Florida Politics   A committee working to reelect Angela Dempsey in Florida's 2nd Judicial Circuit sent out an email summarizing the many racist and misogynistic social media posts made by her opponent, Alvarez. 'I am uncomfortable repeating the language used above, but I felt it was important for the community to know who is running to be their Circuit Judge,' the committee's Jimmy Gustafson said. The posts, dated between 2009 and 2011, haven't gone unnoticed by those paying attention to the race. The posts were considered too vulgar to publish according to at least one news agency.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boydforflorida.com\">https://www.boydforflorida.com</url>   TOP OPINION   'Shevrin Jones: Less talk, more action in the fight for racial justice[94]' via Florida Politics   The Black Lives Matter movement has continued to gain traction in recent years as countless Black men, women, and children senselessly lost their lives. For years, organizers have laid the groundwork in government and culture, calling attention to the systemic problems facing communities of color, and advocating for reforms to correct course after 400+ years of injustice. There is something notably different, however, about this moment. For the first time in my lifetime, there is a palpable shift in the discourse and a sustained national conversation about race. People across backgrounds, generations, and the ideological spectrum are showing up and advancing the conversation   community by community, block by block, kitchen table by kitchen table.   OPINIONS   'John Roberts is no pro-choice hero[95]' via The New York Times editorial board   The Supreme Court upheld abortion rights on Monday, with Chief Justice Roberts concurring with the liberals on the court to strike down a Louisiana anti-abortion law. That sentence might surprise a lot of people, given that the chief justice is a staunch conservative, and that the court now has a solid right-wing majority. Roberts dissented in a case just four years ago that struck down what was an effectively identical Texas anti-abortion law. In a concurring opinion that provided the fifth vote for a majority, the chief justice wrote that the court's doctrine requires it to 'treat like cases alike.' 'Could America's pandemic response be any more medieval?[96]' via Dana Milbank of The Washington Post   Rand Paul doesn't much care what Anthony Fauci has to say. The Kentucky Republican gets his public health advice from Friedrich Hayek. Hayek, the Austrian-born economist and libertarian hero, died in 1992. But Paul, an ophthalmologist before he took up politics, still takes medical guidance from the 20th-century philosopher. 'Hayek had it right!' Paul proclaimed at Tuesday's Senate health committee hearing on the coronavirus pandemic. 'Only decentralized power and decision-making based on millions of individualized situations can arrive at what risks and behaviors each individual should choose.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://govinntallahassee.com\">https://govinntallahassee.com</url>   TODAY'S SUNRISE   More than 6,000 new cases of coronavirus were reported by the health department Tuesday, which brings Florida's running total to more than 152,000 since March. Also, on today's Sunrise:   The COVID-19 surge in Florida is now so bad that even the military is staying away. The Department of Defense says the Sunshine State is off-limits to military personnel because of the virus. The Vice President also canceled two campaign stops in central Florida.   Floridians who want to visit relatives in prison will have to wait. The Department of Corrections has extended the ban on personal visitation until the middle of the month.   July 1 is a big day for state government. The new budget takes effect, as does many of the bills passed during the 2020 Session, including the House Speaker's health care reform bills.   A deep dive into Gov.DeSantis' environmental agenda. The Governor signed two bills that have been hailed as game changers in Florida, including one setting serious fines for polluters in a state that has a reputation for letting development run wild.

You know the one. 'Well, I saw it with the original cast.' On Friday, Miranda will steal that boast from anyone who ever saw 'Hamilton' in its blistering first year and a half on Broadway. A live capture taken from two of the last performances with most of the original cast in June 2016 will premiere on Disney+, opening a new chapter in Miranda's ever-evolving pop-culture phenomenon. Over Independence Day, more people will see 'Hamilton' than ever before. Director Kail, who also shepherded the stage show, dispersed nine cameras and some 100 microphones around the Richard Rodgers Theatre to document the performances.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hamilton-5.8.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hamilton-5.8.jpg</url> More people will see 'Hamilton' over the July 4 weekend than have ever seen it on Broadway.

By Peter Schorsch, Phil Ammann, Daniel McAuliffe, Jim Rosica, and Drew Wilson.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.neilcombee.us/ \">https://www.neilcombee.us/ </url> FIVE TAKEAWAYS FROM THE FINAL REPUBLICAN DEBATE     Who won? Neither candidate scored a knockout punch. Adam Putnam tried to attack early but didn't succeed in highlighting policy differences between him and poll-leader Ron DeSantis. They're both Republican. They both support Donald Trump. They both love the Second Amendment. And DeSantis has a big lead in the polls with less than three weeks left before the Aug. 28 primary. So, you'd have to say DeSantis won by not losing.   Set your GPS: Putnam tried hard to stress his Florida roots, noting, 'I don't need a GPS to get around the state.' It seemed like a glancing blow, though, that had basically no impact on the debate stage and likely will have the same at the ballot box.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gop-debate-jacksonville-8.8.18.jpgThe\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gop-debate-jacksonville-8.8.18.jpgThe</url> final bow: Adam Putnam and Ron Desantis duke it out in the last GOP gubernatorial debate before the Aug. 28 primary.  The big man himself: Putnam clearly has been staggered by Trump's endorsement of DeSantis, a point amplified last week at a rally in Tampa. DeSantis has run ads touting that endorsement, referring to Trump as 'the big man himself.' Putnam was left to lament, 'I wish he hadn't put his thumb on the scale of a Florida campaign.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/disaster-response.html \">https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/disaster-response.html </url> GOP health care plan: Don't get sick: Pressed directly if they believed health care is a basic right, Putnam stuck his foot deeper into the abyss than DeSantis. Putnam after trying to tap-dance around the question, responded, 'It is not a right for all.' DeSantis hemmed and hawed with a talking point quote that probably would make a less damaging sound bite in November, responding, 'I think people should have the right to pursue the type of health care they want.'   Was anyone paying attention anyway: In some markets, particularly Tampa Bay, you had to really want to watch this. It was not available on regular TV; you had to search it out online. With early ballots going out and opinion polls hardening, was this debate the political equivalent of a tree falling in the forest? Could be.   THE TOP SEVEN INSULTS FROM THE DEBATE   With a hat/tip to Kevin Donohoe:   'A career politician with A.D.D.': DeSantis on Putnam: 'Ron DeSantis has run for three offices in three years. That's a career politician with A.D.D.'   'Seinfeld candidate': Putnam on DeSantis: He's a 'Seinfeld candidate' running a campaign 'about nothing.'   'Trump card': Putnam on DeSantis: 'The Trump card is the only card you have.'   'Errand boy': DeSantis on Putnam: 'Adam is the errand boy for U.S. Sugar, he's going to stand for them.'  \u00a0'A face on a milk carton': DeSantis on Putnam during the 2016 presidential race: 'Never showed up to a single rally   you could have put his face on a milk carton. No one knew where he was.'  \u00a0'Casino owners and pornographers': Putnam on DeSantis' billionaire backers: 'My opponent's contributions have come from casino owners and pornographers on the West Coast.'  \u00a0'You can put everything he knows on a sticky note':Putnam tweeted[1], 'You can put everything @RonDeSantisFL knows about water on a sticky note and still have room for your grocery list.'

The 15-second ad, 'Worry,' is running statewide in both English and Spanish versions.

SHOPPING SPREE   Gwen Graham's affiliation, albeit somewhat remote, with the planned American Dream Miami megamall project evolved into a campaign issue seemingly overnight last week.\u00a0 Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene released television ads attacking Graham for her 'family ties' to the project, and she responded with ads attacking Greene for going after Bob Graham, writes[5] Lawrence Mower for the Tampa Bay Times.\u00a0 Diving into Graham's alleged connections with the project, Mower notes, 'the Graham Companies own part of the land where it would be built, and the company plans on building a mixed-use project on 300 acres south of the mall. Both the mall and the Grahams' commercial project received zoning approval by Miami-Dade County commissioners in a 9-1 vote in May.'\u00a0 Graham's stake: 'The family company, founded decades ago, is Graham's greatest source of wealth. She owns nearly $14 million in company stock, and she made $830,000 in income last year from the company, according to her most recent financial disclosure.'\u00a0 The problem: Environmental interests oppose the mall, including the Everglades Trust, which endorsed Graham earlier this week.\u00a0 But: It doesn't appear that environmental organizations fear Graham having a future conflict of interest. The director of the Everglades Trust told Mower, 'we now know Gwen Graham has nothing to do with the project.' 'Greene says he sold his oil, energy investments as feud with Graham escalates[6]' via David Smiley and Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times  \u00a0Greene\u00a0sold off the oil and energy investments that have become a flashpoint in his campaign to become Florida's next Governor. Greene, who listed $3.3 billion in assets this summer, did not provide a list of what he said he has sold, or any documents detailing the transactions. But he said in a statement that he had unloaded his stock in companies that were the source of criticism aimed at him hours earlier by Democratic front-runner\u00a0Graham, with whom he's engaged in an increasingly contentious feud over the last week. Graham's campaign blasted Greene over his investments in Exxon Mobil Corp., Hess Corp., Blackburn Partners, Tujunga Partners, KinderMorgan, California Resources Corp., Ness Energy, Occidental Petroleum Corp., and Quantum Energy Partners   all companies involved in energy and oil and listed by Greene as sources of secondary income.

The Aug. 5-7 live call survey of 600 likely primary voters (MoE +/- 4%) by North Star Opinion Research showed DeSantis reaching the key 50 percent mark for supporters, with 50 percent backing him and 30 percent supporting Putnam.

With a margin of error of 4.9 percent, however, the results are just barely out of a statistical tie. Asked if they wanted to re-elect Stargel or someone else, the poll said 33 percent of the voters want Stargel re-elected, 39 percent said they they'd vote for someone else and 28 percent said they didn't know.

That's according to an internal polling memo by\u00a0Pizzo's campaign. Pizzo's polling found that he was running with 36 percent support to Campbell's 19 heading into August. Outside of the normal\u00a0qualifiers\u00a0we offer about internal polls, there's a big caveat for Pizzo, and it's not the 4 percent margin of error for the survey of 350 voters: Nearly half of voters queried remained undecided.

Now prisons are taking the players.[28]' via Ben Conarck of the Florida Times-Union   In April last year, the Florida Department of Corrections struck a deal with JPay. The private company, spearheading a push to sell profit-driven multimedia tablets to incarcerated people across the country, would be allowed to bring the technology to every facility in the nation's third-largest prison system. But there was a catch. Inmates had already been purchasing electronic entertainment for the last seven years   an MP3 player program run by a different company: Access Corrections. For around $100, Access sold various models of MP3 players that inmates could then use to download songs for $1.70 each, and keep them in their dorms. More than 30,299 players were sold, and 6.7 million songs were downloaded over the life of the Access contract, according to the Department of Corrections. That's about $11.3 million worth of music. Because of the tablets, inmates will have to return the players, and they can't transfer the music they already purchased onto their new devices.

The 2017 legislation shifted a key burden of proof in 'stand your ground' cases from defendants to prosecutors. But a ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal and rulings by at least two other appellate courts have split on whether the change should apply retroactively to defendants whose cases were pending at the time the legislation took effect. The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to take up the retroactivity issue in a Miami-Dade County case from the 3rd District Court of Appeal, though justices have not scheduled arguments. The ruling from the 4th District Court of Appeal in a Palm Beach County case agreed with the conclusion from the 3rd District Court of Appeal that the 2017 change should not apply retroactively. The 2nd District Court of Appeal, however, took the opposite stance in a Hillsborough County case.

Michael McGlockton said that if the law didn't exist, his son might have gone home the night of July 19, or Drejka might have been arrested. Instead, McGlockton said, he buried his firstborn while the killer walked free. 'No law should be able to protect somebody to the point that they kill somebody on the street and they can lay in the bed the same night,' McGlockton said. 'To me and my family, that's a slap in the face. (Drejka) would've thought twice before he pulled the trigger. With the law, he knew that he could hide behind that.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/michael-mcglockton.jpgMichael\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/michael-mcglockton.jpgMichael</url> McGlockton holds a photo of his son, Markeis McGlockton.;;'Records show road rage, gun threats in stand your ground shooter's past[35]' via Kathryn Varn and Zachary Sampson of the Tampa Bay Times   Since 2012, according to records and interviews, 47-year-oldDrejka\u00a0has been the accused aggressor in four incidents. Investigators documented three cases in police reports. The other was not shared with authorities at the time but involved the same handicap-reserved parking spot outside the Circle A Food Store near Clearwater and another shooting threat. Two involved allegations of Drejka showing a gun. In another, a trooper accused him of aggressive driving and cited him after a crash when Drejka braked hard in front of a woman driving with two children. Drejka has not spoken publicly in the weeks since he shot and killed McGlockton. No one has spoken much about him, either. Not family. Not neighbors. Not lawyers. Drejka remains, in many ways, an enigma to the public.

Four dolphins found dead off Venice, is red tide to blame?[36]' via the Sarasota Herald-Tribune   According to Mote Marine Laboratory, two dead bottlenose dolphins were recovered on a beach in Venice. A third dead dolphin was recovered from the Intracoastal Waterway near Snake Island and the fourth was recovered from Caspersen Beach. Two of the dolphins are male, one is female and the fourth's sex is unknown. Mote staff will conduct necropsies on the four marine mammals to find out the cause of death. All four were moderate to severely decomposed, which complicates the efforts, Mote says. These may be the first dead dolphins reported in Sarasota-Manatee since the start of the red tide bloom. More than 80 manatees have died this year from red tide. 'Are oysters the key to battling red tide in Florida?[37]' via Mark Young of the Bradenton Herald   One oyster filters between nine and 50 gallons of water a day, according to\u00a0Sandy Gilbert, CEO of START, which launched the Gulf Coast Oyster Recycling Renewal program a little more than a year ago. The organization was started in 1995 during another massive red tide bloom in Manatee County and has been working to restore the county's shellfish population. 'Clams and oysters are an important part of our ecosystem,' Charlie Hunsicker, director of the Manatee County Parks and Natural Resources Department, told the county commission. 'They are little creatures that are part of a bigger plan, and we believe, part of the solution to help with red tide.' About 280 volunteers have been working this past year bagging oysters and placing them along the Manatee River and in strategic locations in Sarasota Bay and Robinson Preserve. What Richard Corcoran is reading   'Tallahassee Classical goes before charter appeal commission[38]' via Ashley White of the Tallahassee Democrat   Tallahassee Classical School, whose charter application was denied by the Leon County School District this spring, takes its case to a higher authority The seven-person Charter School Appeal Commission will hear the appeal beginning 9:30 a.m. at the Florida Department of Education, 325 W. Gaines St. Both the school district and charter school are expected to present their cases. The commission will then make a recommendation whether to deny or grant the appeal. After the recommendation, the appeal will go to the State Board of Education, which makes the final decision. 'The state board must consider the commission's recommendation in making its decision but is not bound by the recommendation,' according to Florida Statute 1002.33.   D.C. MATTERS   'The shadow rulers of the VA[39]' via Isaac Arnsdorf of ProPublica   Three Mar-a-Lago members  \u00a0Ike Perlmutter, the chairman of Marvel Entertainment;\u00a0Bruce Moskowitz, a Palm Beach doctor; and a lawyer named\u00a0Marc Sherman\u00a0  together make up an informal council that is exerting sweeping influence on the Department of Veterans Affairs. None of them has ever served in the U.S. military or government. Yet from a thousand miles away, they have leaned on VA officials and steered policies affecting millions of Americans. They have remained hidden except to a few VA insiders, who have come to call them the 'Mar-a-Lago Crowd.' Documents reveal a previously unknown triumvirate that hovered over public servants without any transparency, accountability or oversight. The Mar-a-Lago Crowd spoke with VA officials daily, the documents show, reviewing all manner of policy and personnel decisions. They prodded the VA to start new programs, and officials traveled to Mar-a-Lago at taxpayer expense to hear their views. 'Everyone has to go down and kiss the ring,' a former administration official said.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shadow-rulers.jpgDonald\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shadow-rulers.jpgDonald</url> Trump shakes hands with Isaac 'Ike' Perlmutter, an Israeli-American billionaire, and the CEO of Marvel, right, before signing an Executive Order on 'Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection' at the Department of Veterans Affairs.'White House head of communications for Hispanic media, Helen Ferre, makes quiet exit[40]' via David Adams of Univision -\u00a0Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, 60, who is the daughter of Nicaraguan parents, has not spoken publicly about her departure, which was confirmed to Univision by Mercedes Schlapp, the White House director of Strategic Communications.\u00a0Her unannounced exit from the White House comes in the midst of the immigration crisis over Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy, but Aguirre Ferr\u00e9 has not publicly expressed any reservations about its impact on immigrant families. In fact, she defended the policy and never gave any sign of her loyalty wavering. At a Latina Leaders Summit in June she said; 'I support the President's efforts in securing the border and I support the President's efforts in ensuring that the laws are enacted properly.'  OPINIONS   'Booting Infowars' Alex Jones from social media wasn't wrong, but it could be dangerous[41]' via Cathy Young for the Tallahassee Democrat   To state the obvious: There are no constitutional issues\u00a0involved,\u00a0since the First Amendment protects speech only from intervention by the government. Some, including Rep.\u00a0Steve King, have argued that since today's big tech companies wield virtual monopoly power in the marketplace, they should be treated as public utilities when it comes to speech   an ironic stance that puts conservatives in the position of calling for more government regulation. Meanwhile, free speech champions such as attorney and blogger\u00a0Ken White\u00a0warn that any attempt to treat social media platforms as 'public forums' where First Amendment principles should govern will lead to pernicious government intrusion. But what if\u00a0Jones\u00a0was subjected to a more radical\u00a0deplatforming\u00a0  and what if it was the start of a slippery slope? At least one politician, Rep. Chris Murphy, seemed to advocate exactly that, tweeting that 'Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies' and that sites like Facebook and YouTube 'must do more than take down one website.' When calls for internet companies to restrict objectionable speech turn into political pressure, it should be worrying even to those who shed no tears for Jones. What happens if the Jones purge is followed by a more far-reaching ideological crackdown   targeting, for example, sites like Breitbart or The Federalist? The likely result will not be to silence the\u00a0right,\u00a0but to fracture the internet.   MOVEMENTS   'Appeals court keeps Clay judicial hopeful off ballot[42]' via the News Service of Florida   A three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal rejected arguments by\u00a0Lucy Ann Hoover, who sought to run against Clay County Judge\u00a0Kristina Mobley. Hoover scurried May 4 to meet a noon qualifying deadline for the race, according to the ruling. But a required financial-disclosure document was not notarized at the county elections supervisor's office until 12:12 p.m.   12 minutes late. The elections supervisor initially qualified Hoover as a candidate on the basis that she was in the supervisor's office before the qualifying deadline, according to the appeals court. But Mobley challenged the qualification, and a circuit judge ruled Hoover should not be on the ballot. 'Financial regulator pick pushed back[43]' via the News Service of Florida  \u00a0Kristin Olson,\u00a0Scott's Cabinet aide, said the governor's office continues to review applicants for the job of commissioner of the Office of Financial Regulation and another position as inspector general of the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp. 'Our office needed more time to review those candidates, so they'll be on the next Cabinet agenda,' Olson said. The Cabinet meets only two more times this year after next Tuesday's meeting: Sept. 11 and Dec. 4. Scott and the Cabinet   Attorney General\u00a0Pam Bondi, Agriculture Commissioner\u00a0Adam Putnam\u00a0and Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Jimmy Patronis\u00a0  in June agreed to name\u00a0Pam Epting\u00a0as acting commissioner of the Office of Financial Regulation and to reopen the application process after interviewing five applicants. An additional 20 applications were submitted following the June meeting. Epting was the deputy commissioner of the office and is not among the applicants to replace former Commissioner Drew Breakspear, who resigned under pressure from Patronis.   ALOE   ''Every minute matters': Disney die-hards race to hit 49 rides in one day[44]' via Nancy Coleman of The Wall Street Journal   For an elite group of Disney superfans, doing it all in one day requires months of planning. Challengers dart from the Mad Tea Party to Space Mountain while braving the Florida heat, swarms of tourists and the\u00a0occasional\u00a0broken toe. Runners map out detailed routes in hopes of joining the few\u00a0dozen\u00a0who have ever completed the grueling race. To endure the 20-plus-mile day, some train by hitting the treadmill, Rollerblading or running in quarter-mile sprints to imitate racing between rides. There is no grand prize, only celebrity status among other admiring fans. Runners compare the challenge to a giant jigsaw puzzle with constantly moving pieces: Depending on the day, parks officially open as early as 7 a.m. and close as late as 1 a.m. Some ride times are around 20 minutes long, others are just two minutes. Waiting times vary widely, some rides have a notoriously slim operating window, and hopping between parks could take around a half-hour. The resort covers nearly 40 square miles.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/disney-rides-wsj.jpgBrothers\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/disney-rides-wsj.jpgBrothers</url> Reagan (foreground) and Ryan Wagoner on the Astro Orbiter during a ride race at Disney World.

Magic Leap has spent years raising billions of dollars from investors without a product to show for it. Now, the company will face its first real test as reactions roll in. CNBC reporter\u00a0Todd Haselton, who was invited to test out the headset, writes the 'experience with the goggles was like a computer-generated 3D world with real depth.'

By Peter Schorsch, Phil Ammann, Daniel McAuliffe, Jim Rosica, and Drew Wilson.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.neilcombee.us/\u2014\">https://www.neilcombee.us/\u2014</url> FIVE TAKEAWAYS FROM THE FINAL REPUBLICAN DEBATE \u2014 \u2014 Who won? Neither candidate scored a knockout punch. Adam Putnam tried to attack early but didn't succeed in highlighting policy differences between him and poll-leader Ron DeSantis. They're both Republican. They both support Donald Trump. They both love the Second Amendment. And DeSantis has a big lead in the polls with less than three weeks left before the Aug. 28 primary. So, you'd have to say DeSantis won by not losing. \u2014 Set your GPS: Putnam tried hard to stress his Florida roots, noting, 'I don't need a GPS to get around the state.' It seemed like a glancing blow, though, that had basically no impact on the debate stage and likely will have the same at the ballot box.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gop-debate-jacksonville-8.8.18.jpgThe\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gop-debate-jacksonville-8.8.18.jpgThe</url> final bow: Adam Putnam and Ron Desantis duke it out in the last GOP gubernatorial debate before the Aug. 28 primary.\u2014 The big man himself: Putnam clearly has been staggered by Trump's endorsement of DeSantis, a point amplified last week at a rally in Tampa. DeSantis has run ads touting that endorsement, referring to Trump as 'the big man himself.' Putnam was left to lament, 'I wish he hadn't put his thumb on the scale of a Florida campaign.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/disaster-response.html\u2014\">https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/disaster-response.html\u2014</url> GOP health care plan: Don't get sick: Pressed directly if they believed health care is a basic right, Putnam stuck his foot deeper into the abyss than DeSantis. Putnam after trying to tap-dance around the question, responded, 'It is not a right for all.' DeSantis hemmed and hawed with a talking point quote that probably would make a less damaging sound bite in November, responding, 'I think people should have the right to pursue the type of health care they want.' \u2014 Was anyone paying attention anyway: In some markets, particularly Tampa Bay, you had to really want to watch this. It was not available on regular TV; you had to search it out online. With early ballots going out and opinion polls hardening, was this debate the political equivalent of a tree falling in the forest? Could be. \u2014 THE TOP SEVEN INSULTS FROM THE DEBATE \u2014 With a hat/tip to Kevin Donohoe: \u2014 'A career politician with A.D.D.': DeSantis on Putnam: 'Ron DeSantis has run for three offices in three years. That's a career politician with A.D.D.' \u2014 'Seinfeld candidate': Putnam on DeSantis: He's a 'Seinfeld candidate' running a campaign 'about nothing.' \u2014 'Trump card': Putnam on DeSantis: 'The Trump card is the only card you have.' \u2014 'Errand boy': DeSantis on Putnam: 'Adam is the errand boy for U.S. Sugar, he's going to stand for them.' \u2014'A face on a milk carton': DeSantis on Putnam during the 2016 presidential race: 'Never showed up to a single rally \u2014 you could have put his face on a milk carton. No one knew where he was.' \u2014'Casino owners and pornographers': Putnam on DeSantis' billionaire backers: 'My opponent's contributions have come from casino owners and pornographers on the West Coast.' \u2014'You can put everything he knows on a sticky note':Putnam tweeted[1], 'You can put everything @RonDeSantisFL knows about water on a sticky note and still have room for your grocery list.' \u2014 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS \u2014 \u2014@RealDonaldTrump:As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win! I LOVE the people, ...ey certainly seem to like the job I'm doing. If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave! \u2014@SteveSchale:#PinkWave rising in Florida 61% of absentees cast so far in Democratic primary are from women. 60% of those cast by people with no midterm primary history are from women. \u2014@ScottforFlorida: .@SenBillNelson you are embarrassing yourself and our state. There is no justification for you attacking my wife. Ann is an incredible person. After 46 yrs in office, why can't you say anything positive about yourself? Let's keep this race about our records and plans for FL. \u2014@Daniel_Sweeney:I'm so old, I remember when Rick Scott released an ad attacking Carole Crist for not releasing her taxes in 2014 \u2014@AGGancarski:My post-debate thoughts: Putnam won. Some great lines. Not sure if this had the reach of the first debate. Ultimately they agree on most things except sugar industry. On Medicaid, charter schools, Guns, cannabis, et al: no real difference. \u2014@Fineout:Some of the words tossed around tonight in GOP debate from Florida - 'pornographers' 'errand boy,' 'unicorns and rainbows' 'he's lying' 'attacking me with fake news' 'put it on your sticky note.' 'They are playing hide the ball.' 'It may sound good in a Harvard economics class.' \u2014@LMower3:The weirdest part of tonight's debate was how @adamputnam thinks it's a bad thing to be compared to the greatest sitcom of all time. #Seinfeldcandidate \u2014@SContorno:As much as Republican candidates use the 'liberal media' as a punching bag, an astounding amount of the fodder in tonight's debate came directly from stories published by the @TB_Times, @PolitiFact and other news outlets. \u2014@MarcACaputo:Sheldon Adelson spox hits back at Adam Putnam for attacking Ron DeSantis over taking 'casino' $: 'that was sort of a foolish remark to make. He's probably just jealous as desperately as his campaign tried to get money from the Adelsons I'm surprised he made an issue of it' \u2014@MoteMarineLab:Mote Stranding Investigations Program recovered four deceased dolphins. Two were recovered last night and two this morning. Mote staff will conduct necropsies on all four dolphins to investigate their cause of death. Thank you to all who helped report these animals! \u2014@SteveLemongello:By the way y'all, the @orlandosentinel has turned off comments on our stories.

John Sowinski, chairman of Voters In Charge, which is behind the 'Voter Control of Gambling' amendment, on Wednesday confirmed the total buy The committee is sitting on nearly $10 million in cash-on-hand, according to campaign finance records listed on the Division of Elections website Wednesday. Sowinski said those numbers do not reflect contributions that came in the last 10 days, which he did not disclose. \u2014 NELSON VS. SCOTT \u2014 Florida teachers' union backs Bill Nelson\u2014 Pointing to his unwavering support of public schools and public education employees, the Florida Education Association along with the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers endorsed Nelson's re-election bid. Nelson met with current and retired educators and support personnel at the Hillsborough Teachers Union Hall to discuss the importance of public education funding, teacher pay and supporting our students to invest in the future of Florida. With the new school year beginning, they talked about challenges and about funding for school safety, educating immigrant students, and other issues facing Florida educators and schools. 'Nelson knows and appreciates the value of our public schools andpublic schooleducators,' said Florida Education Association PresidentJoanne McCall. 'We stand with Bill Nelson because he has been a steadfast supporter of our students, teachers, support staff and schools, and has fought for funding for programs to assist some of Florida's most vulnerable students.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nelson-Tampa-3.jpgIn\">http://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Nelson-Tampa-3.jpgIn</url> a Tampa news conference, Bill Nelson receives the endorsement of the Florida Education Association for his re-election bid.;;'Democratic PACs hitting Rick Scott on Medicaid, pre-existing conditions[3]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 Senate Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action PAC are launching a new $1.1 million digital ad campaign to blanket the internet with a new advertisement hitting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Gov.Scottfor refusing to expand Medicaid in Florida and charging that he opposes mandatory insurance coverage of people with pre-existing conditions. The 15-second ad, 'Worry,' is running statewide in both English and Spanish versions. The ads will run across a broad range of platforms including Facebook, Google, YouTube and Pandora, as well as on online news platforms such as CNN, The New York Times, Univision and Telemundo.

Amelia St., Orlando. \u2014 SHOPPING SPREE \u2014 Gwen Graham's affiliation, albeit somewhat remote, with the planned American Dream Miami megamall project evolved into a campaign issue seemingly overnight last week. Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene released television ads attacking Graham for her 'family ties' to the project, and she responded with ads attacking Greene for going after Bob Graham, writes[5] Lawrence Mower for the Tampa Bay Times. Diving into Graham's alleged connections with the project, Mower notes, 'the Graham Companies own part of the land where it would be built, and the company plans on building a mixed-use project on 300 acres south of the mall. Both the mall and the Grahams' commercial project received zoning approval by Miami-Dade County commissioners in a 9-1 vote in May.'

Now prisons are taking the players.[28]' via Ben Conarck of the Florida Times-Union \u2014 In April last year, the Florida Department of Corrections struck a deal with JPay. The private company, spearheading a push to sell profit-driven multimedia tablets to incarcerated people across the country, would be allowed to bring the technology to every facility in the nation's third-largest prison system. But there was a catch. Inmates had already been purchasing electronic entertainment for the last seven years \u2014 an MP3 player program run by a different company: Access Corrections. For around $100, Access sold various models of MP3 players that inmates could then use to download songs for $1.70 each, and keep them in their dorms. More than 30,299 players were sold, and 6.7 million songs were downloaded over the life of the Access contract, according to the Department of Corrections. That's about $11.3 million worth of music. Because of the tablets, inmates will have to return the players, and they can't transfer the music they already purchased onto their new devices.

The 2017 legislation shifted a key burden of proof in 'stand your ground' cases from defendants to prosecutors. But a ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal and rulings by at least two other appellate courts have split on whether the change should apply retroactively to defendants whose cases were pending at the time the legislation took effect. The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to take up the retroactivity issue in a Miami-Dade County case from the 3rd District Court of Appeal, though justices have not scheduled arguments. The ruling from the 4th District Court of Appeal in a Palm Beach County case agreed with the conclusion from the 3rd District Court of Appeal that the 2017 change should not apply retroactively. The 2nd District Court of Appeal, however, took the opposite stance in a Hillsborough County case.

Some, including Rep.Steve King, have argued that since today's big tech companies wield virtual monopoly power in the marketplace, they should be treated as public utilities when it comes to speech \u2014 an ironic stance that puts conservatives in the position of calling for more government regulation. Meanwhile, free speech champions such as attorney and bloggerKen Whitewarn that any attempt to treat social media platforms as 'public forums' where First Amendment principles should govern will lead to pernicious government intrusion. But what ifJoneswas subjected to a more radicaldeplatforming\u2014 and what if it was the start of a slippery slope? At least one politician, Rep. Chris Murphy, seemed to advocate exactly that, tweeting that 'Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies' and that sites like Facebook and YouTube 'must do more than take down one website.' When calls for internet companies to restrict objectionable speech turn into political pressure, it should be worrying even to those who shed no tears for Jones. What happens if the Jones purge is followed by a more far-reaching ideological crackdown \u2014 targeting, for example, sites like Breitbart or The Federalist?

Rick Scott? Oh, honorable one? You might want to think twice, three times, or maybe a hundred before going ahead with another juvenile stunt like the one you just pulled. Troll is not a good look for you, not when everyone examines the big picture. Florida's former Governor and current junior U.S. Senator sent letters to the governors of six states[1], 'outlining his concerns about rising debt in their states, and the actions he took as Governor to turn around Florida's economy.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rick-scott.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rick-scott.png</url> Oh, really? Rick Scott tries to tell Governors how to run their states successfully.; That's how his office phrased it in a news release. I'm sure the Governors of Illinois, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut, and New Jersey were thrilled to learn of Scott's concern and paid rapt attention. Coincidentally, or maybe not, they are all Democrats. Take the blueprint he provided to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who no doubt gave it due attention before asking, 'Who is Rick Scott?' 'When I was elected Governor of Florida in 2010, our state faced enormous challenges: rising rates of unemployment, growing state debt, thousands of burdensome regulations stifling our small businesses, and taxes increased by more than $2 billion in the previous four years before I took office,' Scott wrote. 'In two terms as Governor, we turned Florida from a state in financial free fall to the best state to live, work, and raise a family.' What else did Gov. Scott accomplish in his two terms as Florida's top pol, besides turning us into the Wawa capital of the world? Well, he gutted environmental regulations, and his Department of Environmental Protection couldn't utter the words 'climate change.'[2] It might be a coincidence that two major toxic algae blooms occurred on Scott's watch. Or, it might not. Each state is different, with diverse needs. It's easy for Scott to take a potshot at those other states, but he never had to run them. He doesn't know what challenges those governors face. He doesn't know what their citizens need or prioritize. Scott doesn't need to be throwing stones. I mean, one of those Governors might just throw a jar of green algae goo back at him. That stuff smells bad, too.

'These guys, my guess is never dealt with anybody directly other than fundraisers.' Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were charged with using a company to donate large sums to Republican campaigns across the country. Federal campaign finance law bars donations from foreign sources. A file photo from The Associated Press showed Parnas and Fruman standing next to Ron DeSantis at his victory celebration in Orlando. The Governor's spokeswoman said DeSantis has had no 'one-on-one' contact with the duo. 'We need to continue to make sure that any type of these foreign players that are caught are fully prosecuted, and I'm glad our guys returned the money,' Gruters said.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DeSantis-Parnas.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DeSantis-Parnas.jpeg</url> Lev Parnas takes the stage behind Ron DeSantis during his victory in 2018.;;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/113915;4119252;50126;211;0/?ft_width=1ft_height=1url=25370312\">https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/113915;4119252;50126;211;0/?ft_width=1ft_height=1url=25370312</url>   DATELINE: TALLY   Assignment editors   DeSantis will make a major announcement, 8:30 a.m., Loxahatchee River District (enter through Gate 2), 2500 Jupiter Park Drive, Jupiter. Cabinet mulls termination of farmland lease   DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet will discuss the early termination of a lease on farming land in the Everglades next week, Bruce Ritchie of POLITICO Florida reports. The termination of the lease between the state and a subsidiary of Florida Crystals Corp. could see the state payout $2.4 million. The decision follows Florida Crystals' announcement earlier this month that it would voluntarily terminate its lease on the 6,170-acre tract, which covers part of the site for a planned water storage reservoir. In a separate case, The Florida Department of Environmental Protection recommended the Cabinet pay $1,940 per acre for terminating a lease that was renewed by the state for 30 years in 2015. The Cabinet meeting will be held at 9 a.m. Oct. 22. 'Wilton Simpson puts focus on businesses, water, children[9]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida   Shortly after Trilby Republican Simpson was formally elected Tuesday as Florida's next Senate president, he characterized himself as a farmer and an entrepreneur   and not a politician. And with that introduction, the 53-year-old owner of an egg farm and an environmental-remediation company vowed to tackle Florida's economy with 'common-sense, fiscally conservative principles' and to foster a business-friendly environment. 'If you are a Florida business, we will do all we can to keep you here,' Simpson said. 'If you are a business located in a high-tax, over-regulated, unwelcoming state   consider moving to Florida, where we believe the American dream and the Florida Dream are one in the same.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH013-Large.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH013-Large.jpg</url> Wilton Simpson takes the gavel for 2020.

Senate panel approves Job Growth Grant Fund change   The Senate Commerce and Tourism Committee voted unanimously in favor of a bill that would allow DeSantis to pump Job Growth Grant Fund cash into training programs at charter schools, reports Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida. For a charter school to be eligible for the funds, it must award high school diplomas exclusively through the Career and Technical Education graduation pathway. That pathway requires CTE and work-based learning program credits and must result in the completion of an industry-recognized certification. SB 130, sponsored by Sen.

'State officials promise legislation to speed up payment of hurricane insurance claims[10]' via Lawrence Mower of the Herald/Times Tallahassee bureau  Florida's insurance consumer advocate will propose legislation to ease frustrations of Panhandle residents about the slow rate of payments for Hurricane Michael claims, she said Tuesday.Consumer Advocate Tasha Carter told state senators that she and her boss, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, are working on a consumer protection-focused package of ideas that lawmakers could vote on when the next legislative session starts Jan. 14.'Insurance consumers are very frustrated with their insurance companies,' Carter said. 'They're frustrated that their claims have not been closed and that they have not been handled appropriately. 'Before House panel, critics raise alarm over legalizing 'adult-use' of marijuana[11]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   Bertha K. Madras, professor of psychobiology at Harvard Medical School, warned the House Health Human Services Committee that legalization would have negative effects. 'I am opposed to legalization for obvious reasons,' Madras said. 'Marijuana is not benign. It is not safe. It is addictive. It is psychotomimetic. It interferes with learning and memory.' Madras paid particular focus to studies in recent years showing levels of THC rising in marijuana. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the psychoactive ingredient that causes marijuana's 'high.' As an NPR report detailed: 'One study of pot products seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the potency increased from about 4 percent THC in 1995 to about 12 percent in 2014.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH007-Large.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH007-Large.jpg</url> Bertha K.

'Democrat lawmakers call for leniency for nonviolent offenders[12]' via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics   Sen. Randolph Bracy, along with House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee and fellow Rep. Dianne Hart, called a news conference to discuss 'gain time' legislation that would let nonviolent offenders out early. They were flanked by people who traveled from across the state to stand with the legislators as they made their case for a bill that appears to have no Republican backing   generally a death knell in a Legislature controlled by the GOP. The legislation (SB 394, HB 189) would allow first-time nonviolent offenders to get out after serving just 65 percent of their sentences, instead of 85 percent. Murderers and other violent offenders would still have to serve 85 percent of their time before being eligible for early release. Assignment editors   State Sen. Lori Berman will join state Rep.

The student wrote he wanted to 'kill officers and then the gatekeeper   then go one by one' and that he would have nine minutes to gun down as many people as possible, considering the distance between the Sheriff's Office and the school. But after the student was arrested, a judge dismissed the case saying prosecutors did not prove the threat was 'transmitted' under state law, Baker County Sheriff's Office Maj.

An attorney for Fierle, who resigned as a guardian statewide July 25, filed two petitions asking the state's 5th District Court of Appeals to reverse the ruling from Orange County Circuit Judge Janet C. Thorpe and remove the judge from the case. Fierle's attorney argues Thorpe overstepped her authority by disciplining his client and wrongly suggesting the Orlando guardian needed permission before signing DNRs from the judge or wards' family members. 'Florida insurance companies took months to pay Hurricane Michael claims[17]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times   Florida insurance Commissioner David Altmaier told lawmakers that he hadn't seen 'even an instance' of insurance companies breaking the law following Hurricane Michael. But records show his office was notified of at least four cases of insurers failing to pay their claims on time, with the companies paying penalties in each instance. The notices came from employees at the Department of Financial Services, which operates an insurance complaint line that has fielded more than 1,700 complaints following the storm. The department sent the most serious cases, including at least four involving companies violating the 90-day statute, to Altmaier's office. 'State officials promise legislation to speed up payment of hurricane insurance claims[18]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times   Consumer Advocate Tasha Carter told state Senators that she and her boss, Florida Chief Financial Officer Patronis, are working on a consumer protection-focused package of ideas that lawmakers could vote on when the next Legislative Session starts Jan. 14. 'Insurance consumers are very frustrated with their insurance companies,' Carter said. 'They're frustrated that their claims have not been closed and that they have not been handled appropriately.' For a year, people in the Panhandle have been complaining about insurance companies giving low estimates or taking months to pay their claims.

By comparison, Hurricane Michael, which devastated parts of Northwest Florida last year, has generated about 150,000 claims and $7.16 billion in estimated insured losses. Hurricane Dorian flattened parts of the Bahamas and threatened Florida before staying off the state's East Coast. Of the 5,764 claims filed, 3,113 involved residential property, the Office of Insurance Regulation numbers show. As of Oct. 4, 62.7 percent of the claims had been closed. 'Florida's lack of dental care hurts low-income and rural residents[20]' via Lloyd Dunkelberger of Florida Phoenix   As of Sept. 30, 5.46 million Floridians   about one in four residents   lived in areas lacking dentists, according to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration's latest report on 'designated health professional shortage areas.' It would take an additional 1,230 dentists to resolve that unmet need in Florida. Many of those people without access to regular dental care are poor or live in rural communities, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts. Additionally, Pew found that the more than 55 million children and adults nationally who have some dental coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program 'also face a scarcity of care' because many dentists don't accept public insurance.   FLORIDA'S SOBRIETY INDUSTRY   South Florida has 478 licensed facilities for drug treatment, notes Colton Wooten in The New Yorker[21]. That's more treatment centers than elementary schools.

For years, South Florida has been known as a 'haven for 12-step programs.' Wooten writes: 'In 2007, the Times described the constellation of sober homes in Delray Beach as 'a funky outpost of sobriety,' and 'the epicenter of the country's largest and most vibrant recovery community.'' One of the factors is Delray Beach's appeal to private residential-rehab facilities, offering their own outpatient treatment plans   which developed into the so-called Florida Model, a less expensive option for those seeking recovery who have either bad credit, criminal records or lack the resources to live alone. By 2010, the Affordable Care Act changed the landscape of addiction treatment, mandating that insurance companies cover services for substance-use disorders   and prohibiting limits for preexisting conditions. While addiction alone is not a preexisting condition, relapse   which is common among addicts   could count as one. This made it easier for treatment centers to bill insurance, making it fall within the reaches of the middle class. 'Little in medicine is as ill-defined or as anecdotal as addiction treatment,' Wooten writes. 'Like any industry in a period of explosive growth, addiction treatment attracted wrongdoers. Insurance fraud became rampant.' Along with rehab centers, urinalysis for drug use is also became profitable   a 'liquid gold mine'   despite the lack of regulation defining best practices. 'The kids who arrived for treatment soon saw that their insurance policies could be used as expense accounts for detox or sober living,' Wooten notes.    NOTES FROM ELSEWHERE   What Jeff Brandes is reading   'Illinois drivers have paid $1 billion in red light camera tickets in last 10 years[22]' via CBS2 Chicago   Illinois drivers have forked over an astounding $1 billion in red light camera fines in the past 10 years, according to a new study. Now, some lawmakers in Springfield are reviving a push to ban the cameras. At least two state representatives have introduced proposed legislation to eliminate red-light cameras in Illinois, although both proposals remain in the infancy stages.

What Erin Gillespie is reading   'Across Pa., lucrative Donald Trump tax break isn't delivering for the struggling places that need it most[24]' via SpotlightPA   A federal tax incentive program passed in 2017 by Republicans in Congress has been hailed by Trump as a lifeline for ailing Rust Belt cities The central premise of the program is simple: Offer wealthy investors generous tax breaks for putting money into real estate or businesses in distressed areas. Those areas were designated 'opportunity zones.' In Pennsylvania, however, early signs suggest the program is not living up to the claims of transformative change, and is unlikely to be a cure for communities most in need.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://wearegeo.com\">https://wearegeo.com</url>/   PEACHY   'Nancy Pelosi holds often vote to authorize Trump impeachment inquiry   for now[25]' via John Bresnahan, Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle of POLITICO   Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be 'reassessed at some point.' Trump, White House official and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son or risk losing U.S. military aid.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pelosi.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pelosi.jpg</url> Nancy Pelosi is holding off a House floor vote on impeachment. 'Trump's impeachment barricade crumbles[26]' via Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio of POLITICO   The President's former top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill   the first White House official to cooperate in Democrats' investigation of the Ukraine scandal   has detailed for lawmakers a trail of alleged corruption that extends from Kyiv to the West Wing. In dramatic testimony, she roped in some of Trump's top advisers as witnesses to the unfolding controversy. And Tuesday, a senior State Department official, George Kent, appeared on Capitol Hill to testify about his knowledge of the episode despite an attempt by Trump administration lawyers to block him. It's the latest evidence that the White House's stonewalling against congressional requests for documents and testimony is crumbling   and Democrats are feeling a new sense of momentum. 'John Bolton's eruption shows that Trump's defenses are collapsing[27]' via Greg Sargent of The Washington Post   Trump's explicitly declared position in the scandal consuming his presidency is that pressuring a foreign power to 'investigate' a leading domestic political opponent absolutely falls within his rightfully exercised authority. But this defense is cracking up. That's because we're now learning, one after another, that all the people around him knew that it was grievously wrong   that is, all except for those who were carrying out Trump's corrupt scheme. The latest domino to fall is John Bolton, who grew so alarmed by efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch 'investigations' into Biden and his son that he instructed an aide to alert White House lawyers. That aide is Fiona Hill, a former senior White House adviser on Russia and Europe. 'Lara Trump: Impeachment 'hysteria' will die down[28]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics   'Impeachment hysteria, as I continue to call it, will ultimately die down,' said Trump, who is married to Trump's son Eric and is an adviser to the President's reelection campaign, Donald J. Trump for President. She was speaking in one of two briefings the Trump campaign held for journalists, essentially offering the 'Stop the Madness' protests as a short-term response to pressure moderate Democrats in swing districts, such as U.S. Reps. Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy, while the long-term strategy focuses on organizing ground operations nationally, while pushing the messaging of a booming economy.   D.C. MATTERS   'Republicans buckle to Trump on Syria[29]' via Burgess Everett, Melanie Zanona and Marianne Levine of POLITICO   Republicans unleashed perhaps their most aggressive outcry of the Trump era after he abandoned the U.S.'s Kurdish allies and ceded northeastern Syria to Turkey. But now GOP lawmakers are dialing back their direct criticism of the President   instead working with Trump, dinging Democrats and trying to move forward. Senior Republicans are coordinating with Trump's top officials to try to rein in Turkey with sanctions and protect the Kurds, and while they're still dissatisfied with the situation, they've shifted gears away from confrontation with the President.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flchamber.com/event_post/future-of-florida-forum/\">https://www.flchamber.com/event_post/future-of-florida-forum/</url>   2020   'Elizabeth Warren wins big in Broward Young Democrats straw poll, far ahead of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders[30]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   The U.S. Senator from Massachusetts received 27 first-choice votes (her closest competitor received 15).

THE TRAIL   'Eight ain't enough: Ted Yoho keeps fundraising, almost as if a 2020 candidate[31]' via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics  The Congressman raised $49,410[32] in the 3rd quarter of 2019, which ran through Sept. 30. This is nearly two-thirds of the $76,614 he has raised this cycle. Of that money, just two checks totaling $5,000 came from Florida political action committees, with one more individual contribution from Florida. Yoho's campaign committee has nearly a quarter-million dollars on hand. This is factoring in third-quarter spending of over $26,000, including a $318 tab at a Trump Hotel in D.C.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ted-Yoho.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ted-Yoho.jpg</url> Ted Yoho keeps fundraising but does not explain precisely why. 'Ross Spano (barely) digs himself out of the red in latest campaign finance activity[33]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   He's out quite a bit of cash thanks to loan repayments to his botched 2018 campaign loans. Reports show Spano raised $117,000 from July through September, bringing his total amount raised this year to $400,000. But he repaid $110,000 to loans that fueled his 2018 campaign that Spano admitted amounted to illegal campaign contributions. That leaves nearly $60,000 in loans that still need to be paid, which means Spano's campaign still owes almost as much as it's worth. 'DCCC roasts Spano in 'here I fixed it for you' news release rewrite[34]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   After Spano's campaign sent out a news release morning defending its 3rd quarter fundraising, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wasted no time in picking it to pieces. The DCCC offered a simple edit, striking through the campaign's words and replacing them with 'worst quarter of 2019' and 'historically weak.' Spano's release said the campaign had repaid loans, which the DCCC added were illegal, at the advice of 'staff from the Federal Election Commission,' which resulted in nearly zeroing out Spano's campaign's worth. With loans still owed, Spano's campaign is worth just $10,000, a fact the DCCC noted in its edit was 'one of the lowest account balances of any member of Congress.' 'Adam Hattersley rakes in six figures in first congressional campaign finance report[35]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics   State Rep. Hattersley raised $115,000 during the third quarter report period for his Congressional campaign. That quarter covers July through September. Hattersley didn't enter the race until the end of July. Hattersley's earnings came from more than 1,800 individual contributions. None of his funding came from corporate political action committees. Hattersley is running for Florida's 15th Congressional District, which represents eastern Hillsborough County. He faces fellow Democrat Alan Cohn in the primary. The winner will take on incumbent Spano. Laura Loomer raises $154K for CD 21 bid   Far-right activist Loomer has raised $154,000 for her bid to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel in Florida's 21st Congressional District, Gary Fineout of POLITICO Florida reports. Loomer is one of several Republicans challenging Frankel in the reliably Democratic congressional district. 'Despite the radical left, big tech tyrants and the fake-news media doing everything they can to hinder my campaign, this early showing puts career politician Lois Frankel and the do-nothing-Democrats in Congress on notice that no seat is safe and that I'm running to win,' Loomer said. Frankel has posted her third-quarter fundraising numbers, but she raised nearly $328,000 in the first half of the year.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/loomer.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/loomer.jpg</url> Laura Loomer raises $154K, but compared to her opponents, she has a rough road ahead. 'Maria Elvira Salazar brings in $504K in 3Q, topping Donna Shalala[36]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics   That hefty haul was helped in part by a $50,000 loan from Salazar to her campaign. But even just looking at outside contributions, Salazar's $454,000 number tops Shalala's third-quarter figure by about $140,000. Indeed, Shalala's biggest quarter this year, her second quarter, showed Shalala raising $422,000. Salazar's number tops that as well. This is, however, Salazar's first filing with the FEC this cycle. Candidates typically shoot for a significant number in their first fundraising report, so it remains to be seen whether Salazar will keep up the fundraising pace as she continues her challenge against Shalala. 'Joe Harding takes fundraising lead in HD 22 contest[37]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics   Republican Harding added more than $13,000 to his campaign account last month, putting him ahead in the contest to replace term-limited Rep. Charlie Stone in House District 22. Harding's haul brought him past the $85,000 mark. With candidate loans included, he has raised more than $99,000 and has about $97,000 in the bank. Also seeking the Republican nomination is Russ Randall, who reported $1,075 in September receipts. The report was his lowest of the cycle. All told, Randall has raised $81,225 and has about $79,600 on hand. Harding's campaign called the month a 'turning point' in the race, citing the exit of former Republican Rep. Kurt Kelly and an endorsement from current Republican Rep. Stan McClain.

He's worked for the Democratic Party and as a political consultant since, and now he's campaigning to represent a district he's called home since March 2018. The first-time candidate, born and raised in Puerto Rico, sees his youth and recent move into the district as assets more than liabilities. He counters any criticism of his newness to the district by comparing his candidacy to the political rise of immigrants who move to the United States, a narrative that he said should resonate with families in the diverse District 1. 'For [critics] to use that kind of message here, it's disappointing,' he said.

You might get higher taxes[41]' via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel   You could argue Universal   whose parent company posted $11.7 billion in profits last year from families like mine   should pay for its own darn road, since the park is clearly the prime beneficiary. (So much so that Universal is in charge of construction. That's unusual.) Second, if we're going to subsidize businesses, I'd rather subsidize businesses with high wages. Third, there's the price tag. After the state throws in another $16 million and Universal pays $174 million, it's more than $300 million for a 1.7-mile stretch of pavement. That's more, per mile, than the mammoth 10-lane, I-4 Ultimate project. Fourth, if construction comes in under budget, the theme park   not taxpayers   get most, if not all, of the savings. 'Orlando drivers among best in U.S., survey finds[42]' via Tiffani Theisen of the Orlando Sentinel   That's according to QuoteWizard, an online insurance comparison company owned by LendingTree.

'Calculated means having a careful plan or a prearranged design to commit murder. In this case, they were careful enough to follow and stalk their victim,' Cappleman said. But Garcia's defense attorney argued Katherine Magbanua was controlling Garcia, which he says is a mitigating factor.

But she was setting her sights on retrying Garcia's longtime girlfriend, Magbanua, whose case ended with a hung jury. 'We will be going forward with that case,' Cappleman said after Garcia's sentencing. 'The state will retry Ms. Magbanua.' The 34-year-old faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder. Cappleman, who argued for death, said Garcia, 37, killed Markel for financial gain in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner.

On the witness stand in his trial at the Orange County Courthouse, Loyd said the shooting wasn't his fault because Dixon's brother had attacked him and 'just was reacting' when he gunned the siblings down. 'You're really the victim today here, aren't you?' Assistant State Attorney Ric Ridgway asked the accused killer in front of jurors. 'Of course,' Loyd said.

DeSantis went on a press tour touting a proposal for a statewide minimum salary for teachers of $47,500. His proposal is, however, so light on specifics that it is more of a sketch than a plan at this point. But regardless of whether DeSantis achieves all, some, or none of his stated goal, he has already won. He is now an education governor. And even his continued cooperation with the Republican-controlled Legislature in vandalizing traditional public education in the name of 'school choice' is unlikely to alter this good first impression.

It is not difficult to see why I would take exception to being told to 'shut up,' but to be told to 'shut up' for the specific reason of lacking a college degree requires a response.

Rick Scott? Oh, honorable one? You might want to think twice, three times, or maybe a hundred before going ahead with another juvenile stunt like the one you just pulled. Troll is not a good look for you, not when everyone examines the big picture. Florida's former Governor and current junior U.S. Senator sent letters to the governors of six states[1], 'outlining his concerns about rising debt in their states, and the actions he took as Governor to turn around Florida's economy.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rick-scott.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rick-scott.png</url> Oh, really? Rick Scott tries to tell Governors how to run their states successfully.; That's how his office phrased it in a news release. I'm sure the Governors of Illinois, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut, and New Jersey were thrilled to learn of Scott's concern and paid rapt attention. Coincidentally, or maybe not, they are all Democrats. Take the blueprint he provided to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who no doubt gave it due attention before asking, 'Who is Rick Scott?' 'When I was elected Governor of Florida in 2010, our state faced enormous challenges: rising rates of unemployment, growing state debt, thousands of burdensome regulations stifling our small businesses, and taxes increased by more than $2 billion in the previous four years before I took office,' Scott wrote. 'In two terms as Governor, we turned Florida from a state in financial free fall to the best state to live, work, and raise a family.' What else did Gov. Scott accomplish in his two terms as Florida's top pol, besides turning us into the Wawa capital of the world? Well, he gutted environmental regulations, and his Department of Environmental Protection couldn't utter the words 'climate change.'[2] It might be a coincidence that two major toxic algae blooms occurred on Scott's watch. Or, it might not. Each state is different, with diverse needs. It's easy for Scott to take a potshot at those other states, but he never had to run them. He doesn't know what challenges those governors face. He doesn't know what their citizens need or prioritize. Scott doesn't need to be throwing stones. I mean, one of those Governors might just throw a jar of green algae goo back at him. That stuff smells bad, too. \u2014 SUNRISE \u2014 The Department of Children and Families wants its employees to 'be well,' creating a state Office of Well-Being.

'These guys, my guess is never dealt with anybody directly other than fundraisers.' Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were charged with using a company to donate large sums to Republican campaigns across the country. Federal campaign finance law bars donations from foreign sources. A file photo from The Associated Press showed Parnas and Fruman standing next to Ron DeSantis at his victory celebration in Orlando. The Governor's spokeswoman said DeSantis has had no 'one-on-one' contact with the duo. 'We need to continue to make sure that any type of these foreign players that are caught are fully prosecuted, and I'm glad our guys returned the money,' Gruters said.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DeSantis-Parnas.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DeSantis-Parnas.jpeg</url> Lev Parnas takes the stage behind Ron DeSantis during his victory in 2018.;;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/113915;4119252;50126;211;0/?ft_width=1...height=1...=25370312\">https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/113915;4119252;50126;211;0/?ft_width=1...height=1...=25370312</url> \u2014 DATELINE: TALLY \u2014 Assignment editors \u2014 DeSantis will make a major announcement, 8:30 a.m., Loxahatchee River District (enter through Gate 2), 2500 Jupiter Park Drive, Jupiter. Cabinet mulls termination of farmland lease \u2014 DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet will discuss the early termination of a lease on farming land in the Everglades next week, Bruce Ritchie of POLITICO Florida reports. The termination of the lease between the state and a subsidiary of Florida Crystals Corp. could see the state payout $2.4 million. The decision follows Florida Crystals' announcement earlier this month that it would voluntarily terminate its lease on the 6,170-acre tract, which covers part of the site for a planned water storage reservoir. In a separate case, The Florida Department of Environmental Protection recommended the Cabinet pay $1,940 per acre for terminating a lease that was renewed by the state for 30 years in 2015. The Cabinet meeting will be held at 9 a.m. Oct. 22. 'Wilton Simpson puts focus on businesses, water, children[9]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Shortly after Trilby Republican Simpson was formally elected Tuesday as Florida's next Senate president, he characterized himself as a farmer and an entrepreneur \u2014 and not a politician. And with that introduction, the 53-year-old owner of an egg farm and an environmental-remediation company vowed to tackle Florida's economy with 'common-sense, fiscally conservative principles' and to foster a business-friendly environment. 'If you are a Florida business, we will do all we can to keep you here,' Simpson said.

Senate panel approves Job Growth Grant Fund change \u2014 The Senate Commerce and Tourism Committee voted unanimously in favor of a bill that would allow DeSantis to pump Job Growth Grant Fund cash into training programs at charter schools, reports Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida. For a charter school to be eligible for the funds, it must award high school diplomas exclusively through the Career and Technical Education graduation pathway. That pathway requires CTE and work-based learning program credits and must result in the completion of an industry-recognized certification. SB 130, sponsored by Sen. Travis Hutson, has two stops to go before hitting the chamber floor. 'State officials promise legislation to speed up payment of hurricane insurance claims[10]' via Lawrence Mower of the Herald/Times Tallahassee bureau \u2014Florida's insurance consumer advocate will propose legislation to ease frustrations of Panhandle residents about the slow rate of payments for Hurricane Michael claims, she said Tuesday.Consumer Advocate Tasha Carter told state senators that she and her boss, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, are working on a consumer protection-focused package of ideas that lawmakers could vote on when the next legislative session starts Jan. 14.'Insurance consumers are very frustrated with their insurance companies,' Carter said.

'Before House panel, critics raise alarm over legalizing 'adult-use' of marijuana[11]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 Bertha K. Madras, professor of psychobiology at Harvard Medical School, warned the House Health ...man Services Committee that legalization would have negative effects. 'I am opposed to legalization for obvious reasons,' Madras said. 'Marijuana is not benign. It is not safe. It is addictive. It is psychotomimetic. It interferes with learning and memory.' Madras paid particular focus to studies in recent years showing levels of THC rising in marijuana. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the psychoactive ingredient that causes marijuana's 'high.' As an NPR report detailed: 'One study of pot products seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the potency increased from about 4 percent THC in 1995 to about 12 percent in 2014.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH007-Large.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FLAPOL101519CH007-Large.jpg</url> Bertha K.

Dianne Hart, called a news conference to discuss 'gain time' legislation that would let nonviolent offenders out early. They were flanked by people who traveled from across the state to stand with the legislators as they made their case for a bill that appears to have no Republican backing \u2014 generally a death knell in a Legislature controlled by the GOP. The legislation (SB 394, HB 189) would allow first-time nonviolent offenders to get out after serving just 65 percent of their sentences, instead of 85 percent.

The student wrote he wanted to 'kill officers and then the gatekeeper \u2014 then go one by one' and that he would have nine minutes to gun down as many people as possible, considering the distance between the Sheriff's Office and the school.

An attorney for Fierle, who resigned as a guardian statewide July 25, filed two petitions asking the state's 5th District Court of Appeals to reverse the ruling from Orange County Circuit Judge Janet C.

'Florida insurance companies took months to pay Hurricane Michael claims[17]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Florida insurance Commissioner David Altmaier told lawmakers that he hadn't seen 'even an instance' of insurance companies breaking the law following Hurricane Michael.

The notices came from employees at the Department of Financial Services, which operates an insurance complaint line that has fielded more than 1,700 complaints following the storm. The department sent the most serious cases, including at least four involving companies violating the 90-day statute, to Altmaier's office.

By comparison, Hurricane Michael, which devastated parts of Northwest Florida last year, has generated about 150,000 claims and $7.16 billion in estimated insured losses. Hurricane Dorian flattened parts of the Bahamas and threatened Florida before staying off the state's East Coast. Of the 5,764 claims filed, 3,113 involved residential property, the Office of Insurance Regulation numbers show. As of Oct. 4, 62.7 percent of the claims had been closed. 'Florida's lack of dental care hurts low-income and rural residents[20]' via Lloyd Dunkelberger of Florida Phoenix \u2014 As of Sept. 30, 5.46 million Floridians \u2014 about one in four residents \u2014 lived in areas lacking dentists, according to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration's latest report on 'designated health professional shortage areas.' It would take an additional 1,230 dentists to resolve that unmet need in Florida. Many of those people without access to regular dental care are poor or live in rural communities, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts. Additionally, Pew found that the more than 55 million children and adults nationally who have some dental coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program 'also face a scarcity of care' because many dentists don't accept public insurance. \u2014 FLORIDA'S SOBRIETY INDUSTRY \u2014 South Florida has 478 licensed facilities for drug treatment, notes Colton Wooten in The New Yorker[21]. That's more treatment centers than elementary schools. Wooten describes his experiences in the Florida drug treatment 'shuffle,' cycling between addiction and recovery \u2014 and the industry that keeps the cycle going. For years, South Florida has been known as a 'haven for 12-step programs.' Wooten writes: 'In 2007, the Times described the constellation of sober homes in Delray Beach as 'a funky outpost of sobriety,' and 'the epicenter of the country's largest and most vibrant recovery community.'' One of the factors is Delray Beach's appeal to private residential-rehab facilities, offering their own outpatient treatment plans \u2014 which developed into the so-called Florida Model, a less expensive option for those seeking recovery who have either bad credit, criminal records or lack the resources to live alone. By 2010, the Affordable Care Act changed the landscape of addiction treatment, mandating that insurance companies cover services for substance-use disorders \u2014 and prohibiting limits for preexisting conditions. While addiction alone is not a preexisting condition, relapse \u2014 which is common among addicts \u2014 could count as one. This made it easier for treatment centers to bill insurance, making it fall within the reaches of the middle class. 'Little in medicine is as ill-defined or as anecdotal as addiction treatment,' Wooten writes. 'Like any industry in a period of explosive growth, addiction treatment attracted wrongdoers. Insurance fraud became rampant.' Along with rehab centers, urinalysis for drug use is also became profitable \u2014 a 'liquid gold mine' \u2014 despite the lack of regulation defining best practices. 'The kids who arrived for treatment soon saw that their insurance policies could be used as expense accounts for detox or sober living,' Wooten notes.  \u2014 NOTES FROM ELSEWHERE \u2014 What Jeff Brandes is reading \u2014 'Illinois drivers have paid $1 billion in red light camera tickets in last 10 years[22]' via CBS2 Chicago \u2014 Illinois drivers have forked over an astounding $1 billion in red light camera fines in the past 10 years, according to a new study. Now, some lawmakers in Springfield are reviving a push to ban the cameras. At least two state representatives have introduced proposed legislation to eliminate red-light cameras in Illinois, although both proposals remain in the infancy stages.

What Erin Gillespie is reading \u2014 'Across Pa., lucrative Donald Trump tax break isn't delivering for the struggling places that need it most[24]' via SpotlightPA \u2014 A federal tax incentive program passed in 2017 by Republicans in Congress has been hailed by Trump as a lifeline for ailing Rust Belt cities The central premise of the program is simple: Offer wealthy investors generous tax breaks for putting money into real estate or businesses in distressed areas. Those areas were designated 'opportunity zones.' In Pennsylvania, however, early signs suggest the program is not living up to the claims of transformative change, and is unlikely to be a cure for communities most in need.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://wearegeo.com\">https://wearegeo.com</url>/ \u2014 PEACHY \u2014 'Nancy Pelosi holds often vote to authorize Trump impeachment inquiry \u2014 for now[25]' via John Bresnahan, Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle of POLITICO \u2014 Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be 'reassessed at some point.' Trump, White House official and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son or risk losing U.S. military aid.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pelosi.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pelosi.jpg</url> Nancy Pelosi is holding off a House floor vote on impeachment. 'Trump's impeachment barricade crumbles[26]' via Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio of POLITICO \u2014 The President's former top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill \u2014 the first White House official to cooperate in Democrats' investigation of the Ukraine scandal \u2014 has detailed for lawmakers a trail of alleged corruption that extends from Kyiv to the West Wing. In dramatic testimony, she roped in some of Trump's top advisers as witnesses to the unfolding controversy. And Tuesday, a senior State Department official, George Kent, appeared on Capitol Hill to testify about his knowledge of the episode despite an attempt by Trump administration lawyers to block him. It's the latest evidence that the White House's stonewalling against congressional requests for documents and testimony is crumbling \u2014 and Democrats are feeling a new sense of momentum. 'John Bolton's eruption shows that Trump's defenses are collapsing[27]' via Greg Sargent of The Washington Post \u2014 Trump's explicitly declared position in the scandal consuming his presidency is that pressuring a foreign power to 'investigate' a leading domestic political opponent absolutely falls within his rightfully exercised authority. But this defense is cracking up. That's because we're now learning, one after another, that all the people around him knew that it was grievously wrong \u2014 that is, all except for those who were carrying out Trump's corrupt scheme. The latest domino to fall is John Bolton, who grew so alarmed by efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch 'investigations' into Biden and his son that he instructed an aide to alert White House lawyers. That aide is Fiona Hill, a former senior White House adviser on Russia and Europe. 'Lara Trump: Impeachment 'hysteria' will die down[28]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 'Impeachment hysteria, as I continue to call it, will ultimately die down,' said Trump, who is married to Trump's son Eric and is an adviser to the President's reelection campaign, Donald J. Trump for President. She was speaking in one of two briefings the Trump campaign held for journalists, essentially offering the 'Stop the Madness' protests as a short-term response to pressure moderate Democrats in swing districts, such as U.S. Reps. Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy, while the long-term strategy focuses on organizing ground operations nationally, while pushing the messaging of a booming economy. \u2014 D.C. MATTERS \u2014 'Republicans buckle to Trump on Syria[29]' via Burgess Everett, Melanie Zanona and Marianne Levine of POLITICO \u2014 Republicans unleashed perhaps their most aggressive outcry of the Trump era after he abandoned the U.S.'s Kurdish allies and ceded northeastern Syria to Turkey. But now GOP lawmakers are dialing back their direct criticism of the President \u2014 instead working with Trump, dinging Democrats and trying to move forward. Senior Republicans are coordinating with Trump's top officials to try to rein in Turkey with sanctions and protect the Kurds, and while they're still dissatisfied with the situation, they've shifted gears away from confrontation with the President.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flchamber.com/event_post/future-of-florida-forum/\">https://www.flchamber.com/event_post/future-of-florida-forum/</url> \u2014 2020 \u2014 'Elizabeth Warren wins big in Broward Young Democrats straw poll, far ahead of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders[30]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The U.S. Senator from Massachusetts received 27 first-choice votes (her closest competitor received 15).

Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014The Congressman raised $49,410[32] in the 3rd quarter of 2019, which ran through Sept. 30. This is nearly two-thirds of the $76,614 he has raised this cycle. Of that money, just two checks totaling $5,000 came from Florida political action committees, with one more individual contribution from Florida. Yoho's campaign committee has nearly a quarter-million dollars on hand. This is factoring in third-quarter spending of over $26,000, including a $318 tab at a Trump Hotel in D.C.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ted-Yoho.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ted-Yoho.jpg</url> Ted Yoho keeps fundraising but does not explain precisely why. 'Ross Spano (barely) digs himself out of the red in latest campaign finance activity[33]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 He's out quite a bit of cash thanks to loan repayments to his botched 2018 campaign loans. Reports show Spano raised $117,000 from July through September, bringing his total amount raised this year to $400,000. But he repaid $110,000 to loans that fueled his 2018 campaign that Spano admitted amounted to illegal campaign contributions. That leaves nearly $60,000 in loans that still need to be paid, which means Spano's campaign still owes almost as much as it's worth. 'DCCC roasts Spano in 'here I fixed it for you' news release rewrite[34]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 After Spano's campaign sent out a news release morning defending its 3rd quarter fundraising, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wasted no time in picking it to pieces. The DCCC offered a simple edit, striking through the campaign's words and replacing them with 'worst quarter of 2019' and 'historically weak.' Spano's release said the campaign had repaid loans, which the DCCC added were illegal, at the advice of 'staff from the Federal Election Commission,' which resulted in nearly zeroing out Spano's campaign's worth. With loans still owed, Spano's campaign is worth just $10,000, a fact the DCCC noted in its edit was 'one of the lowest account balances of any member of Congress.' 'Adam Hattersley rakes in six figures in first congressional campaign finance report[35]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 State Rep. Hattersley raised $115,000 during the third quarter report period for his Congressional campaign. That quarter covers July through September. Hattersley didn't enter the race until the end of July. Hattersley's earnings came from more than 1,800 individual contributions. None of his funding came from corporate political action committees. Hattersley is running for Florida's 15th Congressional District, which represents eastern Hillsborough County. He faces fellow Democrat Alan Cohn in the primary. The winner will take on incumbent Spano. Laura Loomer raises $154K for CD 21 bid \u2014 Far-right activist Loomer has raised $154,000 for her bid to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel in Florida's 21st Congressional District, Gary Fineout of POLITICO Florida reports. Loomer is one of several Republicans challenging Frankel in the reliably Democratic congressional district. 'Despite the radical left, big tech tyrants and the fake-news media doing everything they can to hinder my campaign, this early showing puts career politician Lois Frankel and the do-nothing-Democrats in Congress on notice that no seat is safe and that I'm running to win,' Loomer said.

'Maria Elvira Salazar brings in $504K in 3Q, topping Donna Shalala[36]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 That hefty haul was helped in part by a $50,000 loan from Salazar to her campaign. But even just looking at outside contributions, Salazar's $454,000 number tops Shalala's third-quarter figure by about $140,000. Indeed, Shalala's biggest quarter this year, her second quarter, showed Shalala raising $422,000. Salazar's number tops that as well. This is, however, Salazar's first filing with the FEC this cycle. Candidates typically shoot for a significant number in their first fundraising report, so it remains to be seen whether Salazar will keep up the fundraising pace as she continues her challenge against Shalala. 'Joe Harding takes fundraising lead in HD 22 contest[37]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics \u2014 Republican Harding added more than $13,000 to his campaign account last month, putting him ahead in the contest to replace term-limited Rep.

Also seeking the Republican nomination is Russ Randall, who reported $1,075 in September receipts. The report was his lowest of the cycle. All told, Randall has raised $81,225 and has about $79,600 on hand. Harding's campaign called the month a 'turning point' in the race, citing the exit of former Republican Rep. Kurt Kelly and an endorsement from current Republican Rep. Stan McClain.

The first-time candidate, born and raised in Puerto Rico, sees his youth and recent move into the district as assets more than liabilities. He counters any criticism of his newness to the district by comparing his candidacy to the political rise of immigrants who move to the United States, a narrative that he said should resonate with families in the diverse District 1.

You might get higher taxes[41]' via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 You could argue Universal \u2014 whose parent company posted $11.7 billion in profits last year from families like mine \u2014 should pay for its own darn road, since the park is clearly the prime beneficiary. (So much so that Universal is in charge of construction. That's unusual.) Second, if we're going to subsidize businesses, I'd rather subsidize businesses with high wages. Third, there's the price tag. After the state throws in another $16 million and Universal pays $174 million, it's more than $300 million for a 1.7-mile stretch of pavement. That's more, per mile, than the mammoth 10-lane, I-4 Ultimate project. Fourth, if construction comes in under budget, the theme park \u2014 not taxpayers \u2014 get most, if not all, of the savings.

But she was setting her sights on retrying Garcia's longtime girlfriend, Magbanua, whose case ended with a hung jury. 'We will be going forward with that case,' Cappleman said after Garcia's sentencing. 'The state will retry Ms. Magbanua.'

DeSantis went on a press tour touting a proposal for a statewide minimum salary for teachers of $47,500. His proposal is, however, so light on specifics that it is more of a sketch than a plan at this point. But regardless of whether DeSantis achieves all, some, or none of his stated goal, he has already won. He is now an education governor. And even his continued cooperation with the Republican-controlled Legislature in vandalizing traditional public education in the name of 'school choice' is unlikely to alter this good first impression.

It is not difficult to see why I would take exception to being told to 'shut up,' but to be told to 'shut up' for the specific reason of lacking a college degree requires a response.

Taggart will receive a reported $18 million buyout after he was fired Sunday following a desultory 27-10 loss Saturday against rival Miami. He was the first African-American FSU head football coach. He is replaced on an interim basis by Odell Haggins, a former FSU African-American football athlete.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/taggart.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/taggart.jpg</url>Florida State fires coach Willie Taggart after 21 games.; Taggart, who grew up in Bradenton, was hired by FSU in 2018 after Jimbo Fisher took the head coaching job at Texas A...Taggart replaced him, despite spending just one season at Oregon after a successful 4-year run at the University of South Florida. The Bulls were 6-18 in Taggart's first two seasons at USF, but 18-7 after that. After going 7-5 in one season at Oregon in 2017, Taggart came back to Florida. Immediately, though, his tenure struggled. Under his leadership, FSU finished 5-7 and missed qualifying for a bowl game for the first time since 1981. While some of the program's decline was blamed on Fisher, Taggart took the brunt of fans' impatience. The problem was Taggart's buyout, but that was raised through about $20 million in private donations. The Seminoles now look to the task of winning two of their last three games to qualify for a bowl game. 'Replacing Willie Taggart: Florida State football coaching hot board[1]' via Wayne McGahee III of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Florida State decided to fire coach Taggart and will need a new head coach for the 2020 season. Who will the FSU administration turn to to get the program back on track? Top target: Dallas Renegades coach/general manager Bob Stoops. Other names to know: Iowa State coach Matt Campbell; Minnesota coach PJ Fleck; Kentucky coach Mark Stoops; Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables; Memphis coach Mike Norvell; Clemson offensive coordinator Jeff Scott; Former Georgia/Miami coach Mark Richt; Washington State coach Mike Leach. 'Where does Florida State go from here after pulling the plug on Taggart?[2]' via Pat Forde of Sports Illustrated \u2014 We already know that Urban Meyer is not going to Tallahassee. Bob Stoops? The first thing he's likely to say to any inquiry is that FSU should call his younger brother, former Seminoles defensive coordinator Mark Stoops, who is currently doing good work at Kentucky. If FSU is intent on closing the chasm between it and ACC top dog Clemson, it can try to raid Dabo Swinney's rock-solid staff. This much is a certainty: it's going to cost another small fortune to hire the next guy, as Florida State continues to burn through money in its quest to regain relevance. 'Kirk Herbstreit blasts FSU lack of discipline, says Seminoles 'program is done'[3]' via Luis Torres of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 Appearing on an Instagram post with Chris Fowler and Chris 'The Bear' Fallica, Herbstreit went on a 90-second rant on the state of FSU football. 'I want to get this off my chest; I'm done with Florida State,' Herbstreit said. 'I don't want to talk about them anymore. I hate the way they represent themselves. Their current roster needs to go back and watch the Bobby Bowden era because it wasn't about talking trash and fighting. That's all they do. They are the most undisciplined team you're gonna watch, and they are a terrible team. They need to focus more on execution and less on chirping. All they do is chirp.' \u2014 TODAY'S SUNRISE \u2014 It's committee week at the Florida Capitol as lawmakers kick into high gear to prepare for the Legislative Session beginning in January.

Here are five things to watch in Florida.[5]' via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Hispanic and Latino voters: Florida's Hispanics are the state's fastest-growing demographic, and both parties believe many of their votes are up in the air. Amendment 4 fallout: It's too early to say how many previously disenfranchised people would vote, or how many will even register. Impeachment: How damaging will the impeachment hearings be \u2014 and who will take the hit? Who is the Democratic nominee: Whoever it is, the Florida Democratic Party vows to turn over a much more robust campaign apparatus than it did for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Election security and Russian interference: Florida should watch these developments closely. It's here that Russians penetrated up to four supervisors of elections offices, according to a Senate intelligence report.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump.jpg</url> How the impeachment saga plays out in Florida will be one of several things to watch for in the 2020 election.

They discussed what kind of fundraising is needed to reelect Donald Trump, according to sources familiar with the meeting. 'Republicans can't lose Florida, so everything's on the table,'' said Al Cardenas, the former longtime chair of the Republican Party of Florida whose business partner, Slater Bayliss, attended the meeting. 'The Governor is essential in raising the funds you need in a presidential election year.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ron-desantis-1.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ron-desantis-1.jpg</url> For Donald Trump to win Florida in 2020, Ron DeSantis will have to shoulder much of the fundraising duties. 'DeSantis health care agenda focuses on implementation, rather than new issues[7]' via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Don't expect much new in the way of a health care agenda from DeSantis' administration for the coming 2020 Session. That's because he says he's more focused on implementing what he already has accomplished. 'We had a lot of good stuff on health care, as you know, from telehealth, CON reform, we did the patient savings where people can save if they choose cheaper options, then the big prescription drug thing,' DeSantis told a group of newspaper reporters and editors in Tallahassee. DeSantis said his administration was 'actively working with HHS' on new proposed rules that would allow Florida to move ahead with its drug importation programs as outlined in HB 19, which he signed into law. Assignment editors \u2014 DeSantis will make a major announcement, 10 a.m., Walmart Supercenter, 35404 U.S. Hwy 19 N, Palm Harbor. Hmmm \u2014 'Florida GOP leaders starting to address climate change again after long ignoring issue[8]' via John Kennedy of GateHouse Capital Bureau \u2014 The GOP-led Florida Senate embraced the change last month, holding its first-ever hearing on climate change \u2014 with experts presenting data on water intrusion and its impact along the state's 8,400 miles of coast. Most in the environmental community are pleased with the newfound attention. But they also wonder: Now what? 'The question will be, what will Gov. DeSantis \u2014 the governor's administration \u2014 allow to happen?' said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit that promotes renewable energy. Manny Diaz celebrates his district's 'A+' schools \u2014 The Florida Department of Education identified more than 30 'A+' schools inside District 36, which is represented by State Sen. Diaz. The list includes district-run schools, such as Spanish Lake Elementary, as well as charter schools, such as Mater Gardens Academy. Those schools are eligible for additional state funding based on the 'A+' designation. 'The 'A+' School Recognition designation is one of the highest honors in education,' Diaz said. 'This honor is not an easy feat, and the determination of these schools deserves to be applauded. Congratulations to the teachers, students, staff and families across our district for ensuring education is a priority for our community.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/manny-diaz.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/manny-diaz.jpg</url> Manny Diaz is touting 'A+' schools in his district, which allow them to get additional state funding. 'Joe Gruters wants to stop abortions of babies with Down syndrome[9]' via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics \u2014 'To me, it's unacceptable that we allow it to happen,' the Sarasota Republican said. Gruters has now filed the Down Syndrome Nondiscrimination Act (SB 734), which would outlaw elective procedures based on genetic testing for the trait. Limiting abortions based on disabilities has been a priority for groups like RollExit. The case against aborting over Down syndrome diagnoses has convinced five other states \u2014 Indiana, Ohio, North Dakota, Louisiana and Kentucky \u2014 to pass restrictions there. 'I got into politics because of the life issue,' Gruters said. 'It's always been extremely important to me.' 'Perry Thurston responds to Stoneman Douglas dad's claim he lied[10]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Thurston, a Broward Democrat, slammed what he characterized as an 'unmitigated attack by the strident voices on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission.' Thurston was referring to comments made by Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son Alex was killed in the school shooting and is a member of the commission. A Schachter said he wasn't attacking Thurston. He said he was trying to set the record straight and calling out the Senator for lying. Thurston, in a written statement Friday evening, said: 'Unfortunately, vocal elements on the commission and within the Parkland community continue to attack anyone who disagrees with their pencil-thin point-of-view.' \u2014 IN THE CAPITOL \u2014 'House, Senate panels to take up fireworks measures[11]' via the News Service of Florida \u2014 Senate Community Affairs and the House Business and Professions Subcommittee are slated to take up nearly identical measures (SB 140, HB 65) by Sen. Travis Hutson and Rep. Ana Maria Rodriguez. The proposals for the 2020 Legislative Session, which begins Jan. 14, would allow individuals to pledge to use the fireworks 'solely and exclusively' during one of three designated holidays. Both measures would allow the use of fireworks on Memorial Day and Independence Day. The Senate proposal also designates the third holiday on New Year's Eve, while the House version allows for the fireworks on New Year's Day.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FLAPOL101519CH021-Large.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FLAPOL101519CH021-Large.jpg</url> Travis Hutson is looking to finally straighten out Florida's fireworks laws.

And the voter registration deadline in Florida is still 29 days before the election. 'Many laws don't get changed as technology changes,' said Orange County elections supervisor Bill Cowles. The early registration deadline is just one example of how the state's elections laws 'are as arbitrary as they come,' said FloridaACLU executive director Micah Kubic. 'Everything is sort of a domino effect,' said Okaloosa County elections supervisor Paul Lux. 'When you move one marker, everything else falls over.' 'Florida and federal officials promise transparency but sidestep specifics on election security[13]' via Jeff Schweers of the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 State, local and federal officials asked the public to trust their ongoing efforts to strengthen Florida's election system leading up to the 2020 elections, but they refused to give any details. 'We are committed to the maximum amount of transparency as possible,' Secretary of State Laurel Lee told more than a dozen reporters at a Tallahassee news conference hosted by Larry Keefe, U.S. Attorney for Florida's northern district. She dodged a barrage of questions about why the state won't say which counties were hacked in 2016, what vulnerabilities her office found during a review of the election systems of all 67 counties, and whether the state would disclose any future breaches or potential breaches to the public.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/laurel-lee.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/laurel-lee.jpg</url> Secretary of State Laurel Lee is promising more transparency in securing elections but has not given any specifics. 'The hidden danger of unvaccinated children in Florida's schools[14]' via Mario Ariza and John Maines of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 Overall, 94 percent of the state's kindergartners have been vaccinated as required, along with 96 percent of seventh-graders, the two grades reported by the Department of Education. Although both are near the state's 95 percent goal, a closer look at individual schools reveals trouble. Only 45 percent of public and charter schools with kindergartners meet the 95 percent goal at a time when diseases such as whooping cough and measles are on the rise, according to data for 2018, the most recent year available. Only 72 percent of schools with seventh graders meet the goal. Many schools do not even come close. 'Florida virtual school needs new board, new ethics standards, state education department says[15]' via Beth Kassab and Leslie Postal of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 The troubled Florida Virtual School should get a new Governor-appointed board, new ethics standards for employees and a new inspector general inside the school to oversee internal audits and investigations, according to a report by the Florida Department of Education. The recommendations are in response to a scandal that rocked the virtual school last year when its former General Counsel Frank Kruppenbacher resigned amid accusations of improper behavior and spending. DeSantis and lawmakers then ordered a state takeover of Florida's public online school. FLVS has been 'plagued in recent years with recurring leadership crises that threatened to destabilize what was otherwise a school with high-quality educators, curriculum and innovative online course delivery,' the report said. Happening today \u2014 The Florida Education Association continues its bus tour focused on calling for increased education funding, 9 a.m., Village Oaks Elementary, 1601 Florida 29, Immokalee. Later the tour visits Lake Trafford Elementary, noon, 3500 Lake Trafford Road, Immokalee.

Bill Montford refiled legislation for the 2020 Session to allocate $50 million a year from the Land Acquisition Trust Fund for projects dedicated to conservation and land management activities in Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Okaloosa, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington counties. While lawmakers advanced more than $220 million toward relief efforts related to Michael during the 2019 Legislative Session earlier this year, a similar trust fund measure proposed by Montford and Rep. Brad Drake failed to advance. 'Housing assistance opportunity helping local hurricane victims[17]' via Olivia Michael of WJHG \u2014 When John Hunt's home was damaged from Hurricane Michael, he didn't know how he would pay for the repairs. That's when he learned about the William E. Sadowski Affordable Housing Act. Michael Johnson, the Director of the Community Development and Redevelopment Agency in Panama City, said, 'It's administered by the Florida Housing Finance Corporation out of Tallahassee.' So far, the program has helped hundreds of Bay County residents pay for things like down payments, first month's rent, and even home repairs. Johnson said, 'In January, we received $1.6 million, and just recently, we received another $4.7 million, and the county received $11 million, and all of those dollars must be used for housing.'

'Battle continues on underground power lines in Florida[18]' via Jim Saunders of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Pointing to concerns about the effects on millions of utility customers, the state Office of Public Counsel is continuing to battle proposed rules for carrying out a law that is expected to lead to building more underground power lines in Florida. The Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers in utility issues, has made a series of legal moves during the past week, after the Florida Public Service Commission approved the proposed rules. The moves included requesting a public hearing on the proposed rules, a hearing that the PSC scheduled for Tuesday. But the Office of Public Counsel argued that is too short of a time frame. \u2014 DEEP DIVE ON INSURANCE \u2014 Resilience, genetic testing, Hurricane Michael, and cybersecurity will be on the agenda as insurance professionals gather in what is billed as the state's 'leading industry summit.'

But the shift among Senate Republicans could complicate the message coming from Trump as he furiously fights the claim that he had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine to pressure it to dig up dirt on a political rival, even as an increasing number of Republicans wonder how long they can continue to argue that no quid pro quo was at play in the matter. The pivot was the main topic during a private Senate GOP lunch.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump-2.jpeg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump-2.jpeg</url> The new Republican Party line on Donald Trump's quid pro quo with Ukraine is that he may have done it, but it doesn't rise to the level of impeachment.; \u2014 D.C. MATTERS \u2014 'What Trump might gain as newest Florida Man[22]' via Matt Dixon and Brian Faler of POLITICO Florida \u2014 There are myriad tax code differences between blue-state New York and Florida, which is overwhelmingly run by Republicans who tout the state's tax climate to attract both people and businesses. Moving to Florida would potentially spare Trump one of the stiffest tax increases included in his 2017 overhaul of the code \u2014 a new $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. That hits wealthy people in blue states particularly hard, because they pay so much in taxes and therefore have a lot to deduct, although it's unclear how much Trump pays. The far more significant savings would come from avoiding New York's 16 percent estate tax, which could potentially be huge. Florida does not have an estate tax. 'Trump may face fight over planned move from NYC to Florida[23]' via Bernard Condon and Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press \u2014 Trump's plan to shift his permanent residence to Palm Beach will likely be heavily scrutinized by New York state officials, who are notorious for auditing wealthy residents seeking to flee to lower-tax states to make sure such moves are real and not just on paper. Those cases can go on for years. 'New York says just because you fill out a piece of paper, that doesn't make you a Floridian,' said Mark Klein, a tax lawyer who has handled hundreds of tax-residency audits. 'People have this misunderstanding that if you go to Florida and fill out an affidavit, you register to vote and you get a driver's license, that is all it takes.'

From the sleep disruption it causes, to the reduction in evening sunlight, the practice of rolling the clock back an hour in the fall and then adjusting forward an hour in the spring offers plenty of reasons for objections. Buchanan and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio have sponsored the 'Sunshine Protection Act,' which would eliminate the clock switching and keep the country in daylight saving time all year.

'Fox News poll: Joe Biden leads nomination race, tops Trump by 12 points in matchup[28]' via Diana Blanton of Fox News \u2014 While most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their field, more than a quarter wish they had other options. Biden leads the nomination race with the backing of 31 percent of Democratic primary voters, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 21 percent, Bernie Sanders at 19 percent, and Pete Buttigieg at 7 percent. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang receive 3 percent apiece, followed by Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, and Amy Klobuchar, each at 2 percent, and Tom Steyer at 1 percent.

'Beto O'Rourke drops out of 2020 race[29]' via David Siders of POLITICO \u2014 O'Rourke, running out of money and flatlining in public opinion polls, abandoned his presidential campaign, exiting the contest just as a crush of better-funded, higher-polling candidates arrived here for an Iowa Democratic Party event. Speaking to a group of tearful supporters on a lawn across from the convention center where O'Rourke had originally been scheduled to appear, O'Rourke pointed to the campaign's inability to raise sufficient money in recent months. 'This is a campaign that has prided itself on seeing things clearly, on speaking honestly and on acting decisively,' O'Rourke said. 'We have to clearly see at this point that we do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully.' 'In Iowa, Biden confronts a growing threat: Pete Buttigieg[30]' via Natasha Korecki of POLITICO \u2014 Biden dropped to fourth place in Iowa, according to a new poll, his worst showing to date in the pivotal early state. A few hours later, at the largest gathering to date for any 2020 event, it was clear why. While Biden delivered a solid performance on stage before a crowd of 13,500 Democrats at the state party's Liberty ...stice dinner, he was overshadowed and outshined by the candidate who just passed him in the polls \u2014 Buttigieg. At the massive state party event known for its catalytic effect on campaigns, Buttigieg captured the audience's imagination, articulating a case for generational change. ''This is going to cause down-ballot damage': Elizabeth Warren's $20 trillion health plan fails to quiet critics[31]' via Marc Caputo and Alex Thompson of POLITICO \u2014 The most-vulnerable Democrat in Colorado's state House, Bri Buentello, is dreading door-knocking in her rural district now that Warren dropped her massive 'Medicare for All' plan into the presidential arena. 'This is going to cause down-ballot damage in swing districts and states if she's the nominee,' Buentello says, describing how her Pueblo-area constituents \u2014 who voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016 \u2014 were already echoing criticisms about a giant, one-size-fits-all big government-run plan that cancels private health insurance and raises taxes. The fear of blowback is indicative of the broad and mostly negative response to Warren's proposal from centrist, moderate and rural Democrats \u2014 many of whom, like Buentello, back Biden in the primary.\u2014 THE TRAIL \u2014 'Florida Democrats focus on voter registration[32]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida \u2014 Pe\u00f1alosatold reporters that the party had registered more than 17,000 voters since June.

Work is complete at only eight of 233 schools, leaving students and teachers in schools with mold, leaky roofs and failing air conditioners. Enrollment has dropped by 3,200 students in district-run schools in the past five years, and about 20% of parents in a survey last school year said poor facilities were a factor.

What about the people who clean them?[43]' via Bob Wile of the Miami Herald \u2014 According to a report from the University of California-Los Angeles' Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, the median wage for contracted office janitors in South Florida is approximately $8.50 per hour. That places South Florida janitorial workers in the bottom 10 percent for contracted janitorial earnings in Florida, a state where low-wage work is already pervasive. And the gap between janitors' wages and the rest of the economy is only growing. While inflation-adjusted wages for all private-sector workers in South Florida have climbed 7.6 percent since 1998, janitorial wages have barely budged, increasing just 1.8 percent. The Miami metro area now ranks 380th out of 382 among all metro areas for janitorial wages when the cost of living is taken into account.

The nuclear plant's swollen price also hovers over JEA's negotiations with bidders interested in buying the utility because its multibillion-dollar Vogtle obligation would need to be resolved if the city were to sell JEA. Plant Vogtle might not be a household name for JEA's 478,000 electric customers because so far, JEA's cost for purchasing power from the plant when Vogtle's two units come online in 2021 and 2022 hasn't shown up in monthly electric bills.

'Twitter ad ban will disadvantage new candidates, grassroots causes[49]' via Joe Clements for the Tallahassee Democrat \u2014 Why should the average voter care about the ad policies of big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook? The simple reason is digital political ads are good for our democracy. Digital political ads provide a huge advantage for upstart candidates and causes with small budgets because they are the only ad format that permits effective small-dollar campaigns. The power of digital ads is that they lower the cost of campaigning and give all candidates and causes the opportunity to run a competitive campaign. The formula is now well known: Find a small group of supporters online, raise small-dollar donations and then reinvest back in the campaign to find even more supporters. 'Restore septic tank inspections, Governor, and fix the Legislature's mistake[50]' via Lee Constantine for the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 In October, the Blue-Green Algae Task Force, appointed by DeSantis, recommended a series of policies to fight toxic algae, including a program to inspect and monitor septic tanks. As the task force pointed out in its report, 'Poorly functioning and/or failing septic systems can contribute disproportionately to nutrient pollution and pose increased health risks.' It's bad enough that Florida doesn't have a program to inspect its nearly 3 million septic tanks, but it's worse that legislators passed a law almost a decade ago to create one, then repealed it before it could take effect. If we don't do something about this problem, we can count on more bills in the future amid mounting damage to our economy, environment and image. 'Joe Henderson: Make private, public, and charter schools play by the same rules[51]' via Florida Politics \u2014 Charters and private schools are here to stay in Florida. But the rules that apply to public schools sometimes don't apply to the other schools. State Sen. Linda Stewart wants to change that. She filed SB 632 to make private and charter schools operate by the same standards as public schools. That seems fair to me. There are excellent charter and private schools, and they can be an attractive alternative to a struggling public school. Students can receive more individual instruction than a sometimes-harried public-school teacher can provide. They can receive religious instruction at a private church school. If the family chooses that route, they should have that right. But while the methods can be different, the standards shouldn't be. 'Legislature needs to fix the crisis it created[52]' via the Citrus County Chronicle editorial board \u2014 Stop raiding the state's housing trust fund.

It improves a family's overall health and helps children to perform better. It makes our communities safer by serving to reduce crime and drug abuse. It lessens the taxpayers' burden by expanding the tax base, enabling the elderly and disabled to live independently, and by breaking the cycle of chronic homelessness. Florida's affordable housing is in crisis due to the legalized looting of more than $2.2 billion from the Sadowski Trust Fund by state lawmakers every year since 2001 \u2014 enough to have subsidized nearly 177,000 new homes.\u2014 MOVEMENTS \u2014 Appointed \u2014 Carlos de la Cruz Jr. and Jason Barrett to the Florida Children and Youth Cabinet.

'The money spent on lobbying by government agencies \u2014 cities, counties, school districts, water agencies, even rent control boards across the Golden State \u2014 consistently ranks at or near the top of the heap,' according to a KQED report. It's a big problem at the local level, too.  \u2014 ALOE \u2014 What Jenna Buzzacco-Foerster is reading \u2014 ''Hamilton' hopefuls arrive early for tickets at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall[55]' via Charles Runnells of the Fort Myers News-Press \u2014 It was 5:30 a.m., and already people were lined up outside Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall. They all wanted the same thing: a shot at some of those much-hyped, much-anticipated 'Hamilton' tickets. The biggest musical of the year is scheduled for performances Jan. 14-26 in Fort Myers. Karen Farhat was one of about 200 people who showed up Saturday hoping to see it. That's why she got to Mann Hall at 4:15 a.m. \u2014 almost four hours before tickets went on sale at 8 a.m.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hamilton-national-tour.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hamilton-national-tour.jpg</url> South Florida is anxious for the arrival of the national tour of 'Hamilton.' \u2014 HAPPY BIRTHDAY \u2014 Celebrating today are lobbyist Carlos Cruz, Angela Dempsey, Rep.

Taggart will receive a reported $18 million buyout after he was fired Sunday following a desultory 27-10 loss Saturday against rival Miami. He was the first African-American FSU head football coach. He is replaced on an interim basis by Odell Haggins, a former FSU African-American football athlete.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/taggart.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/taggart.jpg</url>Florida State fires coach Willie Taggart after 21 games.; Taggart, who grew up in Bradenton, was hired by FSU in 2018 after Jimbo Fisher took the head coaching job at Texas AM. Taggart replaced him, despite spending just one season at Oregon after a successful 4-year run at the University of South Florida. The Bulls were 6-18 in Taggart's first two seasons at USF, but 18-7 after that. After going 7-5 in one season at Oregon in 2017, Taggart came back to Florida. Immediately, though, his tenure struggled. Under his leadership, FSU finished 5-7 and missed qualifying for a bowl game for the first time since 1981. While some of the program's decline was blamed on Fisher, Taggart took the brunt of fans' impatience. The problem was Taggart's buyout, but that was raised through about $20 million in private donations. The Seminoles now look to the task of winning two of their last three games to qualify for a bowl game. 'Replacing Willie Taggart: Florida State football coaching hot board[1]' via Wayne McGahee III of the Tallahassee Democrat   Florida State decided to fire coach Taggart and will need a new head coach for the 2020 season. Who will the FSU administration turn to to get the program back on track? Top target: Dallas Renegades coach/general manager Bob Stoops. Other names to know: Iowa State coach Matt Campbell; Minnesota coach PJ Fleck; Kentucky coach Mark Stoops; Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables; Memphis coach Mike Norvell; Clemson offensive coordinator Jeff Scott; Former Georgia/Miami coach Mark Richt; Washington State coach Mike Leach. 'Where does Florida State go from here after pulling the plug on Taggart?[2]' via Pat Forde of Sports Illustrated   We already know that Urban Meyer is not going to Tallahassee. Bob Stoops? The first thing he's likely to say to any inquiry is that FSU should call his younger brother, former Seminoles defensive coordinator Mark Stoops, who is currently doing good work at Kentucky. If FSU is intent on closing the chasm between it and ACC top dog Clemson, it can try to raid Dabo Swinney's rock-solid staff. This much is a certainty: it's going to cost another small fortune to hire the next guy, as Florida State continues to burn through money in its quest to regain relevance. 'Kirk Herbstreit blasts FSU lack of discipline, says Seminoles 'program is done'[3]' via Luis Torres of the Orlando Sentinel   Appearing on an Instagram post with Chris Fowler and Chris 'The Bear' Fallica, Herbstreit went on a 90-second rant on the state of FSU football. 'I want to get this off my chest; I'm done with Florida State,' Herbstreit said. 'I don't want to talk about them anymore. I hate the way they represent themselves. Their current roster needs to go back and watch the Bobby Bowden era because it wasn't about talking trash and fighting. That's all they do. They are the most undisciplined team you're gonna watch, and they are a terrible team. They need to focus more on execution and less on chirping. All they do is chirp.'   TODAY'S SUNRISE   It's committee week at the Florida Capitol as lawmakers kick into high gear to prepare for the Legislative Session beginning in January. Florida Politics' Jim Rosica stops by the studio with a preview of what's in store.

They'll be on the road for the rest of the month.   Florida is No. 1 in America for fraud; all three members of the state Cabinet are vowing to crack down on fraud, and each has a unique role to play on the issue.

I deleted that tweet about @mattgaetz though I thought it was true and funny, it wasn't kind. I apologize. I am human and will try harder.  @MattGaetz: I've been known to regret a tweet now and then also. There but for the Grace of God go I   @Fineout: Let's be clear: It was this administration that also brought Taggart in inked this deal. And it's now incumbent on them to find a successor.  @SkipFoster:Yes, Willie Taggart will be paid handsomely, but a man just failed at his dream job   there is no joy in that. Keep it classy.  @AOC: Quick Daylight Savings tip: if you worked a late shift last night when the clocks rolled back had to work an extra hour, make sure you check your paystub this week and get paid for it!

Here are five things to watch in Florida.[5]' via Steve Contorno of the Tampa Bay Times   Hispanic and Latino voters: Florida's Hispanics are the state's fastest-growing demographic, and both parties believe many of their votes are up in the air. Amendment 4 fallout: It's too early to say how many previously disenfranchised people would vote, or how many will even register. Impeachment: How damaging will the impeachment hearings be   and who will take the hit? Who is the Democratic nominee: Whoever it is, the Florida Democratic Party vows to turn over a much more robust campaign apparatus than it did for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Election security and Russian interference: Florida should watch these developments closely. It's here that Russians penetrated up to four supervisors of elections offices, according to a Senate intelligence report.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/donald-trump.jpg</url> How the impeachment saga plays out in Florida will be one of several things to watch for in the 2020 election.

They discussed what kind of fundraising is needed to reelect Donald Trump, according to sources familiar with the meeting. 'Republicans can't lose Florida, so everything's on the table,'' said Al Cardenas, the former longtime chair of the Republican Party of Florida whose business partner, Slater Bayliss, attended the meeting.

'DeSantis health care agenda focuses on implementation, rather than new issues[7]' via Christine Sexton of the News Service of Florida   Don't expect much new in the way of a health care agenda from DeSantis' administration for the coming 2020 Session. That's because he says he's more focused on implementing what he already has accomplished. 'We had a lot of good stuff on health care, as you know, from telehealth, CON reform, we did the patient savings where people can save if they choose cheaper options, then the big prescription drug thing,' DeSantis told a group of newspaper reporters and editors in Tallahassee. DeSantis said his administration was 'actively working with HHS' on new proposed rules that would allow Florida to move ahead with its drug importation programs as outlined in HB 19, which he signed into law.

Most in the environmental community are pleased with the newfound attention. But they also wonder: Now what? 'The question will be, what will Gov. DeSantis   the governor's administration   allow to happen?' said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit that promotes renewable energy. Manny Diaz celebrates his district's 'A+' schools   The Florida Department of Education identified more than 30 'A+' schools inside District 36, which is represented by State Sen. Diaz. The list includes district-run schools, such as Spanish Lake Elementary, as well as charter schools, such as Mater Gardens Academy. Those schools are eligible for additional state funding based on the 'A+' designation. 'The 'A+' School Recognition designation is one of the highest honors in education,' Diaz said.

Gruters has now filed the Down Syndrome Nondiscrimination Act (SB 734), which would outlaw elective procedures based on genetic testing for the trait. Limiting abortions based on disabilities has been a priority for groups like RollExit. The case against aborting over Down syndrome diagnoses has convinced five other states   Indiana, Ohio, North Dakota, Louisiana and Kentucky   to pass restrictions there. 'I got into politics because of the life issue,' Gruters said. 'It's always been extremely important to me.' 'Perry Thurston responds to Stoneman Douglas dad's claim he lied[10]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Thurston, a Broward Democrat, slammed what he characterized as an 'unmitigated attack by the strident voices on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission.' Thurston was referring to comments made by Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son Alex was killed in the school shooting and is a member of the commission. A Schachter said he wasn't attacking Thurston. He said he was trying to set the record straight and calling out the Senator for lying. Thurston, in a written statement Friday evening, said: 'Unfortunately, vocal elements on the commission and within the Parkland community continue to attack anyone who disagrees with their pencil-thin point-of-view.'

And the voter registration deadline in Florida is still 29 days before the election. 'Many laws don't get changed as technology changes,' said Orange County elections supervisor Bill Cowles. The early registration deadline is just one example of how the state's elections laws 'are as arbitrary as they come,' said FloridaACLU executive director Micah Kubic. 'Everything is sort of a domino effect,' said Okaloosa County elections supervisor Paul Lux. 'When you move one marker, everything else falls over.' 'Florida and federal officials promise transparency but sidestep specifics on election security[13]' via Jeff Schweers of the Tallahassee Democrat   State, local and federal officials asked the public to trust their ongoing efforts to strengthen Florida's election system leading up to the 2020 elections, but they refused to give any details. 'We are committed to the maximum amount of transparency as possible,' Secretary of State Laurel Lee told more than a dozen reporters at a Tallahassee news conference hosted by Larry Keefe, U.S. Attorney for Florida's northern district. She dodged a barrage of questions about why the state won't say which counties were hacked in 2016, what vulnerabilities her office found during a review of the election systems of all 67 counties, and whether the state would disclose any future breaches or potential breaches to the public.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/laurel-lee.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/laurel-lee.jpg</url> Secretary of State Laurel Lee is promising more transparency in securing elections but has not given any specifics. 'The hidden danger of unvaccinated children in Florida's schools[14]' via Mario Ariza and John Maines of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Overall, 94 percent of the state's kindergartners have been vaccinated as required, along with 96 percent of seventh-graders, the two grades reported by the Department of Education. Although both are near the state's 95 percent goal, a closer look at individual schools reveals trouble. Only 45 percent of public and charter schools with kindergartners meet the 95 percent goal at a time when diseases such as whooping cough and measles are on the rise, according to data for 2018, the most recent year available. Only 72 percent of schools with seventh graders meet the goal. Many schools do not even come close. 'Florida virtual school needs new board, new ethics standards, state education department says[15]' via Beth Kassab and Leslie Postal of the Orlando Sentinel   The troubled Florida Virtual School should get a new Governor-appointed board, new ethics standards for employees and a new inspector general inside the school to oversee internal audits and investigations, according to a report by the Florida Department of Education. The recommendations are in response to a scandal that rocked the virtual school last year when its former General Counsel Frank Kruppenbacher resigned amid accusations of improper behavior and spending. DeSantis and lawmakers then ordered a state takeover of Florida's public online school. FLVS has been 'plagued in recent years with recurring leadership crises that threatened to destabilize what was otherwise a school with high-quality educators, curriculum and innovative online course delivery,' the report said.

'Housing assistance opportunity helping local hurricane victims[17]' via Olivia Michael of WJHG   When John Hunt's home was damaged from Hurricane Michael, he didn't know how he would pay for the repairs.

The Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers in utility issues, has made a series of legal moves during the past week, after the Florida Public Service Commission approved the proposed rules. The moves included requesting a public hearing on the proposed rules, a hearing that the PSC scheduled for Tuesday. But the Office of Public Counsel argued that is too short of a time frame.

But the shift among Senate Republicans could complicate the message coming from Trump as he furiously fights the claim that he had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine to pressure it to dig up dirt on a political rival, even as an increasing number of Republicans wonder how long they can continue to argue that no quid pro quo was at play in the matter.

MATTERS   'What Trump might gain as newest Florida Man[22]' via Matt Dixon and Brian Faler of POLITICO Florida   There are myriad tax code differences between blue-state New York and Florida, which is overwhelmingly run by Republicans who tout the state's tax climate to attract both people and businesses. Moving to Florida would potentially spare Trump one of the stiffest tax increases included in his 2017 overhaul of the code   a new $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. That hits wealthy people in blue states particularly hard, because they pay so much in taxes and therefore have a lot to deduct, although it's unclear how much Trump pays. The far more significant savings would come from avoiding New York's 16 percent estate tax, which could potentially be huge. Florida does not have an estate tax. 'Trump may face fight over planned move from NYC to Florida[23]' via Bernard Condon and Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press   Trump's plan to shift his permanent residence to Palm Beach will likely be heavily scrutinized by New York state officials, who are notorious for auditing wealthy residents seeking to flee to lower-tax states to make sure such moves are real and not just on paper. Those cases can go on for years. 'New York says just because you fill out a piece of paper, that doesn't make you a Floridian,' said Mark Klein, a tax lawyer who has handled hundreds of tax-residency audits. 'People have this misunderstanding that if you go to Florida and fill out an affidavit, you register to vote and you get a driver's license, that is all it takes.'

'Fox News poll: Joe Biden leads nomination race, tops Trump by 12 points in matchup[28]' via Diana Blanton of Fox News   While most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their field, more than a quarter wish they had other options. Biden leads the nomination race with the backing of 31 percent of Democratic primary voters, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 21 percent, Bernie Sanders at 19 percent, and Pete Buttigieg at 7 percent. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang receive 3 percent apiece, followed by Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, and Amy Klobuchar, each at 2 percent, and Tom Steyer at 1 percent.

'Beto O'Rourke drops out of 2020 race[29]' via David Siders of POLITICO   O'Rourke, running out of money and flatlining in public opinion polls, abandoned his presidential campaign, exiting the contest just as a crush of better-funded, higher-polling candidates arrived here for an Iowa Democratic Party event. Speaking to a group of tearful supporters on a lawn across from the convention center where O'Rourke had originally been scheduled to appear, O'Rourke pointed to the campaign's inability to raise sufficient money in recent months. 'This is a campaign that has prided itself on seeing things clearly, on speaking honestly and on acting decisively,' O'Rourke said. 'We have to clearly see at this point that we do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully.' 'In Iowa, Biden confronts a growing threat: Pete Buttigieg[30]' via Natasha Korecki of POLITICO   Biden dropped to fourth place in Iowa, according to a new poll, his worst showing to date in the pivotal early state. A few hours later, at the largest gathering to date for any 2020 event, it was clear why. While Biden delivered a solid performance on stage before a crowd of 13,500 Democrats at the state party's Liberty Justice dinner, he was overshadowed and outshined by the candidate who just passed him in the polls   Buttigieg. At the massive state party event known for its catalytic effect on campaigns, Buttigieg captured the audience's imagination, articulating a case for generational change. ''This is going to cause down-ballot damage': Elizabeth Warren's $20 trillion health plan fails to quiet critics[31]' via Marc Caputo and Alex Thompson of POLITICO   The most-vulnerable Democrat in Colorado's state House, Bri Buentello, is dreading door-knocking in her rural district now that Warren dropped her massive 'Medicare for All' plan into the presidential arena. 'This is going to cause down-ballot damage in swing districts and states if she's the nominee,' Buentello says, describing how her Pueblo-area constituents   who voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016   were already echoing criticisms about a giant, one-size-fits-all big government-run plan that cancels private health insurance and raises taxes. The fear of blowback is indicative of the broad and mostly negative response to Warren's proposal from centrist, moderate and rural Democrats   many of whom, like Buentello, back Biden in the primary.  THE TRAIL   'Florida Democrats focus on voter registration[32]' via Ana Ceballos of the News Service of Florida   Pe\u00f1alosatold reporters that the party had registered more than 17,000 voters since June.

'I was a first-time candidate in 2018, and our upstart campaign came within a tiny margin of defeating an entrenched incumbent backed by big money,' Kagan said in a news release. 'The narrow race proves that Seminole County is moving toward a more inclusive agenda that puts people   not corporations and special interests   first,' she added. 'Families are tired of not having a voice who fights for them in Tallahassee.' 'Sarasota attorney Jason Miller running for state House seat[36]' via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune   Miller is making another run for the House District 72 seat. Miller, 47, ran for the seat   which covers much of northern Sarasota County   last year, losing to former state Rep. Ray Pilon in the GOP primary. Having grown up in Sarasota and lived here much of his life, Miller said he is deeply invested in the community and wants to help solve some of the region's pressing problems, such as ongoing water quality concerns. Miller's public service includes eight years as a prosecutor in the 12th Judicial Circuit, a stint working for the Florida Attorney General's office, and nine years in the U.S. Army Reserve. He currently is a major in the Army JAG Corps Reserve.  'Fewer competitive races in Sarasota and Manatee[37]' via Zac Anderson of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune 'Daniel Perez holding joint fundraiser with Chip LaMarca next week[38]' via Florida Politics   The reception will be held in Tallahassee Wednesday on the second floor of 106 East Jefferson Street, above the Tallahassee Visitors Center. Supporters can get more information on the event by sending in an RSVP. The fundraiser is notable because it shows there's no bad blood between the two freshman lawmakers following the 2024-26 House Speaker race, which Perez won. LaMarca, however, wasn't one of the freshmen in Perez' camp during the behind-the-scenes leadership race according to sources familiar with the competition. ''Auxiliary deputy' Shaquille O'Neal gives $10,000 to Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony's political committee[39]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   In March, the sheriff's office said O'Neal 'now works as an auxiliary deputy' in Broward County   a designation he also enjoyed under Scott Israel. In September, O'Neal gave a $10,000 contribution to the political committee that's raising money to support Tony in the 2020 election. Serving as an honorary law enforcement officer is something O'Neal likes to do. Besides Broward, he's been a reserve police officer or honorary deputy in multiple jurisdictions, including Miami Beach; Doral; Golden Beach; the Port of Los Angeles; Tempe, Ariz.; and Clayton County, Ga.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shaquille-ONeal.jpg\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shaquille-ONeal.jpg</url> Broward County named Shaquille O' Neal auxiliary deputy, after which the basketball star donated $10,000 to Gregory Tony's election effort.

'Hialeah voters have five charter amendments on their ballots[40]' via Christina Morales of the Miami Herald   Hialeah voters could give their Mayor the authority to declare a state of emergency after a hurricane or other disaster, then spend an unlimited amount of city funds on cleanup without approval from the City Council for up to three months. That's one of five proposed amendments to the city's charter that will be on the Nov. 5 ballot and the one that would make the most substantial change to city government. Another would change the date of the city's runoff election to line up with other municipalities. Others would amend the charter to conform to changes in state law, update language or make minor changes.  LOCAL   'Broward schools lag on renovations[41]' via Scott Travis of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel   Five years after Broward schools secured $800 million from taxpayers to renovate crumbling schools, progress has been astoundingly slow, with 97 percent of schools yet to receive long-promised repairs. Work is complete at only eight of 233 schools, leaving students and teachers in schools with mold, leaky roofs and failing air conditioners. Enrollment has dropped by 3,200 students in district-run schools in the past five years, and about 20% of parents in a survey last school year said poor facilities were a factor. The problems related to the $800 million bond, passed by voters in 2014, go beyond widely known delays and cost increases. 'Miami DREAMers mull their future as DACA heads to Supreme Court[42]' via Lautaro Grinspan of the Miami Herald   As they await a Supreme Court decision on the legality of the DACA program   with oral arguments set to start on Nov. 12   some Miami DREAMers are mulling over an uncertain future. On the cusp of a bachelor's degree in biology at Florida International University, Juliette Herrera faces a more uncertain future than most college seniors. During the years she has spent in school, the 28-year-old Venezuela native had seen the country she was born in   but moved away from by the time she was 5   spiral further and further into economic collapse and political chaos. Meanwhile, the United States, the country she calls home, is still working out whether Herrera and other young people like her belong here at all. 'Miami is blooming with skyscrapers. What about the people who clean them?[43]' via Bob Wile of the Miami Herald   According to a report from the University of California-Los Angeles' Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, the median wage for contracted office janitors in South Florida is approximately $8.50 per hour. That places South Florida janitorial workers in the bottom 10 percent for contracted janitorial earnings in Florida, a state where low-wage work is already pervasive. And the gap between janitors' wages and the rest of the economy is only growing. While inflation-adjusted wages for all private-sector workers in South Florida have climbed 7.6 percent since 1998, janitorial wages have barely budged, increasing just 1.8 percent. The Miami metro area now ranks 380th out of 382 among all metro areas for janitorial wages when the cost of living is taken into account.  'Duval's state legislators will introduce bill to have referendum on elected schools superintendent[44]' via Christopher Hong of the Florida Times-Union   The local bill, which was proposed by State Rep. Jason Fischer, was passed by the Duval Delegation 6-2. State Reps. Cord Byrd, Kimberly Daniels, Clay Yarborough, Wyman Duggan, Fischer and State Sen. Aaron Bean voted yes. State Sen. Audrey Gibson and State Rep. Tracie Davis voted no. Fischer has proposed holding a referendum next November to allow voters to decide whether the superintendent should become an elected position, as opposed to an appointed one selected by the Duval County School Board. If the Legislature allowed the referendum and it passes, an election would be held in November 2022 to choose a superintendent.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image1.png\">https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image1.png</url> Jason Fischer's push to have Duval County School Superintendent as an elected position is coming closer to reality.

'Nuclear bill coming due for JEA[45]' via David Bauerlein of the Florida Times-Union   The Plant Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia is 230 miles away from Jacksonville, but the financial impact of the budget-busting plant keeps coming closer as JEA begins to assess how much Vogtle will drive up customers' bills. The nuclear plant's swollen price also hovers over JEA's negotiations with bidders interested in buying the utility because its multibillion-dollar Vogtle obligation would need to be resolved if the city were to sell JEA. Plant Vogtle might not be a household name for JEA's 478,000 electric customers because so far, JEA's cost for purchasing power from the plant when Vogtle's two units come online in 2021 and 2022 hasn't shown up in monthly electric bills. 'Shad Khan, Jaguars expect Lot J development to begin in early 2020[46]' via Jean Frenette of the Florida Times-Union   Jaguars owner Khan and president Mark Lamping expect to get approval for the development of Lot J by January and anticipate groundbreaking to begin by the end of the 2020 first quarter. Khan said the Lot J development, viewed as the city's most significant centerpiece in a decades-old battle to build up downtown Jacksonville, is necessary to break a negative historical trend. 'This has been like a 50-year objective in Jacksonville to do something downtown,' Khan said. 'I've talked to enough people. We are probably as anxious as anybody to break this curse and get something going.'  MORE LOCAL   'Widow of combat veteran who died after fight at Brevard Jail appeals to Governor[47]' via Alessandro Sassoon of FLORIDA TODAY   Kathleen Edwards sent a letter to DeSantis as well as other state and local officials, imploring them to reopen an investigation into the death of her husband, who died after a fight with corrections deputies at the Brevard County Jail in December last year. 'We, community leaders, friends and family of U.S. Army veteran, Gregory L. Edwards, fervently appeal to you as guardians of the public trust,' the letter begins. Edwards, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, was arrested after allegedly assaulting a man on the morning of December 9, 2018. Within a few hours, Edwards would be rushed with no pulse to the hospital from the jail after a fight with a corrections officer during the booking process.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://yoursearchisdone.com\">http://yoursearchisdone.com</url>/   OPINIONS   'Welcome to Florida, Trump, you'll fit right in[48]' via the Bob Morris for the Orlando Sentinel   As a proud fourth-generation Floridian, I applaud your decision to switch your official residency to our state. Welcome! You'll fit right in here. Let your critics whine about how this is all about you not wanting to pay New York taxes. Idiots. Everyone knows you don't pay taxes, at least not at the percentage level we suckers pay. Maybe we can learn something from you. And if that doesn't work out, maybe you can pardon us. Clearly, you are switching states simply because you love it down here. The heat, the bugs, the humidity, the fact that Mar-a-Lago will come tumbling down when the Atlantic Ocean rises to claim it within the next century. But no worries. 'Twitter ad ban will disadvantage new candidates, grassroots causes[49]' via Joe Clements for the Tallahassee Democrat   Why should the average voter care about the ad policies of big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook? The simple reason is digital political ads are good for our democracy. Digital political ads provide a huge advantage for upstart candidates and causes with small budgets because they are the only ad format that permits effective small-dollar campaigns. The power of digital ads is that they lower the cost of campaigning and give all candidates and causes the opportunity to run a competitive campaign. The formula is now well known: Find a small group of supporters online, raise small-dollar donations and then reinvest back in the campaign to find even more supporters. 'Restore septic tank inspections, Governor, and fix the Legislature's mistake[50]' via Lee Constantine for the Orlando Sentinel   In October, the Blue-Green Algae Task Force, appointed by DeSantis, recommended a series of policies to fight toxic algae, including a program to inspect and monitor septic tanks. As the task force pointed out in its report, 'Poorly functioning and/or failing septic systems can contribute disproportionately to nutrient pollution and pose increased health risks.' It's bad enough that Florida doesn't have a program to inspect its nearly 3 million septic tanks, but it's worse that legislators passed a law almost a decade ago to create one, then repealed it before it could take effect. If we don't do something about this problem, we can count on more bills in the future amid mounting damage to our economy, environment and image. 'Joe Henderson: Make private, public, and charter schools play by the same rules[51]' via Florida Politics   Charters and private schools are here to stay in Florida. But the rules that apply to public schools sometimes don't apply to the other schools. State Sen. Linda Stewart wants to change that. She filed SB 632 to make private and charter schools operate by the same standards as public schools. That seems fair to me. There are excellent charter and private schools, and they can be an attractive alternative to a struggling public school. Students can receive more individual instruction than a sometimes-harried public-school teacher can provide. They can receive religious instruction at a private church school. If the family chooses that route, they should have that right. But while the methods can be different, the standards shouldn't be. 'Legislature needs to fix the crisis it created[52]' via the Citrus County Chronicle editorial board   Stop raiding the state's housing trust fund. Demographic research affirms that the availability of affordable housing is fundamental to a community's quality of life. It stimulates local economies by creating jobs. It improves a family's overall health and helps children to perform better. It makes our communities safer by serving to reduce crime and drug abuse. It lessens the taxpayers' burden by expanding the tax base, enabling the elderly and disabled to live independently, and by breaking the cycle of chronic homelessness. Florida's affordable housing is in crisis due to the legalized looting of more than $2.2 billion from the Sadowski Trust Fund by state lawmakers every year since 2001   enough to have subsidized nearly 177,000 new homes.

reins as chief executive of Google parent Alphabet, the soft-spoken, Indian-born Sundar Pichai faces a host of challenges at one of the world's most valuable companies, which has become besieged by activists and political leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 47-year-old Pichai, who will remain as Google CEO in addition to taking up the new post, is seen as a steadying influence at a time when the Silicon Valley titan faces an onslaught from regulators and others.</p><p>The move comes as Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping away from their roles at the company they founded two decades ago in a California garage.</p><p>Pichai will take over from Page as CEO of Alphabet, which includes Google as well as units focused on its \"other bets\" in areas including self-driving cars, life sciences and a variety of \"moonshot\" projects.</p><p>Born in the southern India city of Chennai, Pichai studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur before heading to the United States.</p><p>After leaving India, he earned a degree in engineering and materials science at Stanford University and a master's in business administration at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"He's very intelligent, very capable, seems very low-key and tempered,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research.</p><p>\"I would think he's a calming force overall but he's got to tackle some of these issues.\"</p><p>Hate speech, harassment, privacy</p><p>Known for his Lanvin sneakers and easygoing style, Sundar steps into his new role as antitrust enforcers in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere are stepping up their scrutiny of Google, which is the internet's dominant search engine and also the maker of the leading Android mobile operating system.</p><p>The company has also been in the crosshairs over how it manages \"hate speech\" and extremist content spread online, and how it deals with children's privacy on its YouTube video service.</p><p>Recently, its employees have organized to protest what some claimed was a lack of action on sexual harassment by executives, as well as Google's dealings with the US military and border security authorities.</p><p>When Google dropped out of bidding for a massive military cloud computing contract, it faced criticism for being unpatriotic, and Pichai appeared to ease tensions with a fence-mending visit with President Donald Trump.</p><p>Last December, Pichai kept calm while testifying in Congress as he parried US lawmakers over complaints of political bias and intrusive data collection.</p><p>\"We build our products in a neutral way,\" Pichai said in one exchange.</p><p>Filling a void</p><p>\"His temperament seems very calm and measured, but I don't think that is the reason he is getting the top position,\" said Avi Greengart, of the research consultancy Techsponential.</p><p>Greengart said that Pichai was selected to be the public face of the larger company with Page and Brin fading into the background.</p><p>\"As the big tech companies get in the crosshairs, you need someone who is willing to sit in that seat, and I don't think Sergey and Larry were all that interested,\" he said.</p><p>Greengart said putting Pichai in charge of both Alphabet and Google may be an acknowledgment that the 2015 reorganization was a mistake and that the various operations need to be more tightly integrated.</p><p>\"I don't understand the Alphabet structure,\" Greengart said. \"There are technology platforms (within Alphabet) that need to work together.\"</p><p>The analyst added that Pichai has been effective in helping Google's hardware efforts, especially with its digital home products, which could help reduce its dependence on online advertising.</p><p>\"It does seem clear that hardware endpoints are a big part of his Google strategy,\" he said.</p><p>Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said it's too soon to know if Pichai is up to the task at Alphabet.</p><p>He said Pichai's priorities should be \"to address the massive privacy challenges driven by the current advertising model... to defend getting broken up by regulators and finally, find non-advertising businesses to grow.\"</p><p>An Indian 'export'</p><p>Pichai's low-key style has kept him out of the public limelight. With interests in football and cricket, he is married to a fellow IIT student, Anjali Pichai, with whom he has two children.</p><p>He joins a long list of India-born CEOs of major global companies.</p><p>Among the most notable are Hyderabad-born Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Rajeev Suri of Nokia, Shantanu Narayen of Adobe and, until her departure last year, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo.</p><p>Manu Kumar Jain, the Indian-born vice president of Chinese tech firm Xiaomi, welcomed the news.</p><p>\"From learning alphabets in Jawahar Vidyalaya to leading \"#Alphabet\", one of the most valued tech companies. Congratulations @sundarpichai. You are an inspiration to all,\" Jain tweeted.</p><p>Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra, whose business empire spans everything from cars to real estate, congratulated Pichai, joking that India's \"most robust export product is probably the 'Global CEO.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBBUS-161421790</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBBUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNP-T4D1-JDJN-655F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ArabianBusiness.com - ITP Digital Ltd.

While Facebook and Twitter sent their CEOs, senators noted Mr. Pichai's no-show by leaving an empty chair alongside the witnesses.</p><p> The more than three-hour House hearing Tuesday was vastly different with Republicans shining a harsh spotlight on Google's search algorithms and allegations that the company suppresses right-wing viewpoints because of Silicon Valley's liberal bias.</p><p> Although lawmakers at times displayed limited understanding of the arcana of social media and the fundamentals of web search engines, the lengthy grilling added to momentum that has been building in Congress for legislation to regulate Google and other leading social media platforms in the wake of Kremlin efforts to spread propaganda online during the 2016 presidential election campaign.</p><p> For Google, the bias issue has lingered, as have wider bipartisan worries across Capitol Hill that stricter privacy protections are needed for data that the big tech companies' collect from their billions of users. Mr. Pichai faced multiple questions on Google's expansion plans for China and whether the price of re-entering that market means cooperating with the ruling Communist Party to create a special search engine.</p><p> House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who sits on the judiciary panel, warned Mr. Pichai that \"a free world depends on a free internet\" and noted that Google is responsible for 90 percent of all internet searches. He told Mr. Pichai that there was a \"widening gap of distrust between tech companies and the American people.\"</p><p> Political bias</p><p> Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, criticized Google's monopoly over search engines, cloud-based email and Android mobile operating system. Mr. Goodlatte mentioned a video from the presidential election showing Google employees distraught about Mr. Trump's upset victory.</p><p> \"This committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\" Mr. Goodlatte said about Google search parameters, \"given the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google's values.\"</p><p> The most withering line of questioning was from Rep. Ted Poe, Texas Republican, who raised privacy concerns by holding up his smartphone and asking Mr. Pichai whether his company could track his movements if he walked across the hearing room.</p><p> Mr. Poe lashed out at Mr. Pichai's halting answer. \"You make $100 million a year,\" he said. \"You should be able to answer that question. I'm shocked you don't know. I think Google obviously does.\"</p><p> Rep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee Democrat, at one point wondered how Mr. Pichai could appear multiple times on left-leaning cable network MSNBC but a Google search of his name linked to largely conservative websites.</p><p> While Mr. Pichai faced uncomfortable moments inside the hearing room, critics in the corridors outside were heckling him and chanting, \"Google is evil.\"</p><p> They were led by Alex Jones, founder of the conspiracy theory website Infowars, which has been banned from some Google platforms such as YouTube, and former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, who also claimed to have been censored by the search engine.</p><p> On China, Mr. McCarthy raised concerns over reporting that Google intended to work again with the ruling Communist Party to create a search engine tailored to the government's censoring guidelines. Mr. Pichai repeatedly tried to sidestep the question, saying Google had no firm plans to undertake such a project and would be \"fully transparent\" about the move if that changed.</p><p> But the intense questioning provided a few revelations about the China-tailored search program, code-named Butterfly.</p><p> \"We have explored what search could look like if it were to be launched in a country like China. That's what we explored,\" Mr. Pichai said at one point. At another point, he said \"over 100\" engineers had been working on the project.</p><p> In his opening remarks, Mr. Pichai, an India-born computer engineer and management consultant, tried to get ahead of his congressional critics by insisting that Google never forgets its \"American roots.\"</p><p> \"It's no coincidence that a company dedicated to the free flow of information was founded right here in the U.S.,\" he said. \"As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users.\"</p><p> Democrats, who will take control of the House and the Judiciary Committee in January, at times came to Google's defense. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat in line to become the committee chairman next month, said the idea that Google and other tech companies display an anti-conservative bias was a \"fantasy\" driven by Republicans.</p><p> Mr. Nadler offered hints what could be a new agenda for the committee when it comes under Democratic control. He blasted Republicans for their focus on bias as opposed to the Kremlin's efforts to spread disinformation and fake news across social media during the 2016 presidential election.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-1704334CA565A390</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY6-35V1-DXVP-V474-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>12 December 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

His promotion comes at a pivotal moment for the $893 billion company. Alphabet faces an array of challenges, from ongoing employee unrest to mounting political and regulatory scrutiny. And Pichai will also have to ensure that its booming business continues to grow and please investors. </p><p>Click here for more BI Prime stories.[2] Sundar Pichai[3], CEO of Google, is now officially becoming the CEO of the search giant's parent company, Alphabet, as well \u2014 and he does so at a pivotal moment for the company. The $893 billion tech giant's business is booming: Revenues are trending upwards, and its stock is hovering around all-time highs. But it also faces unprecedented regulatory scrutiny and employee revolts from within \u2014 placing Pichai in a precarious position as he attempts to navigate the company's next chapter. A long-time Google employee, and CEO since 2015, Pichai has faced many of these challenges before. But as he ascends to the top job in Alphabet, the pressure on him will be greater than ever before. The disparity between Alphabet's roaring business and the existential threats it faces is shared by rivals Facebook and Amazon, and reflects a new reality for tech companies: The money has never been better, but there are dark storm clouds on the horizon. The company is increasingly in the political firing line. Critics of big tech, notably US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, are calling for Alphabet and other tech firms to be broken up on antitrust grounds. And ongoing debate about Section 230[4], the US law that helps shield tech firms from liability for objectionable content on their platforms, could produce major hurdles for Google and Alphabet if more serious attempts were made to amend of repeal it. \"From a regulatory and government point of view, a lot of scrutiny that the company is facing, not only in the US but a lot of overseas markets, will continue to be a challenge to navigate, and [to] not let that significantly affect the business,\" said David Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones. Internally, Google has been wracked over the past two years by sometimes paralyzing internal protests and employee dissent, over myriad different issues \u2014 from Google's work with the US military to the company's payouts to executives accused of sexual misconduct. Amid constant leaks and employee activism, the company has now clamped down on its famous culture of transparency, presenting a potential threat to its legendary reputation as a great place to work. Google-owned YouTube is also coming under greater and greater pressure. Facebook has borne the brunt of criticism over content moderation issues in recent years, but the focus has since widened to platforms like YouTube, and its ongoing struggle to police itself for objectionable or illegal content while avoiding perceptions of bias could yields years negative media and political scrutiny for the video-sharing service. Meanwhile, some of Alphabet's other bets are starting to grow up at the exact moment Pichai must take responsibility for them. Waymo, its self-driving car unit, has been valued at more than $100 billion[5], and is well-positioned to be a market leader when self-driving cars hit city streets in earnest over the next decade or so \u2014 but only so long as Pichai is able to successfully steer it to a point of technological and commercial viability. Pichai will also be charged with making sense of Alphabet's other, more esoteric development areas, like nascent drone delivery service Wing or smart city firm Sidewalk Labs. Finally \u2014 and perhaps most importantly \u2014 Pichai must ensure that the company's core business continues to fire on all cylinders, and deliver the healthy growth Wall Street has become accustomed to. \"Just continuing the growth engines that the company has done a very good job of,\" said Heger. \"It's going to be a continuing process of how to maintain that lead they have ... and continue to monetize things like YouTube.\" As it currently stands, industry watchers are optimistic about the 47-year-old tech exec. His appointment is \"a natural progression of the company's evolution,\" said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. \"The guy's done a great job so far ... Google's on the forefront of every secular technology trend.\" Now, Sundar Pichai just needs to make sure it stays there.

In an opinion piece published in the Financial Times[1] over the weekend, the big tech boss says:Now there is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated. It is too important not to.  Pichai's op-ed reads like a preemptive strike. </p><p>It begins with an appeal to his status as an everyday person. He discusses his love for technology dating back to his childhood before immediately moving on to all the good that Google's doing: Just this month there have been three concrete examples of how Alphabet and Google are tapping AI's potential. Nature published our research showing that an AI model can help doctors spot breast cancer in mammograms with greater accuracy; we are using AI to make immediate, hyperlocal forecasts of rainfall more quickly and accurately than existing models as part of a larger set of tools to fight climate change; and Lufthansa Group is working with our cloud division to test the use of AI to help reduce flight delays. We all want to fight breast cancer, fight climate change, and make the trains run on time. Pichai wants to remind us what's at stake before he starts talking about the little g (government) and how it should deal with the big one: Google. He then reminds us that cars have been used for evil, as has the internet. You can almost imagine him standing on a raised dais shouting his rhetoric: These lessons teach us that we need to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong. There are real concerns about the potential negative consequences of AI, from deepfakes to nefarious uses of facial recognition. While there is already some work being done to address these concerns, there will inevitably be more challenges ahead that no one company or industry can solve alone. Related:Sundar Pichai calls for moratorium on facial recognition[2] on the Financial Times It's interesting that he chose deepfakes and facial recognition. With deepfakes, there's no vertical for Google or Alphabet to monetize them right now. It's easy to dismiss deepfakes as harmful technology for a company that doesn't want to talk about[3] how its core service is collecting and selling user data to advertisers[4]. And, as far as facial recognition goes, Google and Alphabet haven't fared well[5] in the surveillance world despite their best efforts to gain a toehold with the US military. Unfortunately for Pichai's empire, Amazon, Palantir, and Microsoft have things fairly well covered[6] in that department. Related:Google employees quit over the company's military AI project[7] We completely agree with Pichai when it comes to facial recognition software. In fact, a complete ban on government use would make more sense at this point[8]. But the fact of the matter remains that Pichai is pointing at those other companies while his works in the shadows with the likes of Facebook[9] and Twitter[10] to socially engineer the human race. It's no surprise that Pichai's underlying message, one he weaves throughout his entire article, is that the government should regulate his competitors' AI, not his. He wants to win our hearts and minds; he wants us to believe that only Alphabet can save us from the evils of government, the ignorance of the average person, and his competitors. Ultimately, Pichai's call for regulation is a warning against it. In his own words:We want to be a helpful and engaged partner to regulators as they grapple with the inevitable tensions and trade-offs. We offer our expertise, experience and tools as we navigate these issues together. AI has the potential to improve billions of lives, and the biggest risk may be failing to do so. By ensuring it is developed responsibly in a way that benefits everyone, we can inspire future generations to believe in the power of technology as much as I do.We'd argue that endangering billions of lives[11] is a bigger risk than failing to improve them. Pichai's promises to help regulators serve the greater good goes against the boots-on-the-ground reality[12] of the way his companies operate. Pichai's warning against over-regulation disguised as a 'gee golly' call for regulation echoes the White House's current policy regarding AI - we recently compared this[13] to Ajit Pai's views on net neutrality. In essence, both advocate for a light-touch regulatory approach[14] designed to clear the way for money-making endeavors. At the end of the day, if you completely trust the Trump administration and Alphabet to decide what's best for the world when it comes to regulating AI, there's nothing to worry about.

As TNW's Ivan Mehta wrote earlier today, the big tech boss published an opinion piece in\u00a0the Financial Times over the weekend where he says:</p><p><br/>Now there is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated. It is too important not to.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Pichai's op-ed reads like a preemptive strike. It begins with an appeal to his status as an everyday person. He discusses his love for technology dating back to his childhood before immediately moving on to all the good that Google's doing:<br/>Just this month there have been three concrete examples of how Alphabet and Google are tapping AI's potential. Nature published our research showing that an AI model can help doctors spot breast cancer in mammograms with greater accuracy; we are using AI to make immediate, hyperlocal forecasts of rainfall more quickly and accurately than existing models as part of a larger set of tools to fight climate change; and Lufthansa Group is working with our cloud division to test the use of AI to help reduce flight delays.<br/>We all want to fight breast cancer, fight climate change, and make the trains run on time. Pichai wants to remind us what's at stake before he starts talking about the little g (government) and how it should deal with the big one: Google.<br/>He then reminds us that cars have been used for evil, as has the internet. You can almost imagine him standing on a raised dais shouting his rhetoric:<br/>These lessons teach us that we need to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong. There are real concerns about the potential negative consequences of AI, from deepfakes to nefarious uses of facial recognition. While there is already some work being done to address these concerns, there will inevitably be more challenges ahead that no one company or industry can solve alone.<br/>Related:\u00a0Sundar Pichai calls for moratorium on facial recognition on the Financial Times<br/>It's interesting that he chose deepfakes and facial recognition. With deepfakes, there's no vertical for Google or Alphabet to monetize them right now. It's easy to dismiss deepfakes as harmful technology for a company that doesn't want to talk about how its core service is collecting and selling user data to advertisers.<br/>And, as far as facial recognition goes, Google and Alphabet haven't fared well in the surveillance world despite their best efforts to gain a toehold with the US military. Unfortunately for Pichai's empire, Amazon, Palantir, and Microsoft have things fairly well covered in that department.<br/>Related:\u00a0Google employees quit over the company's military AI project<br/>We completely agree with Pichai when it comes to facial recognition software. In fact, a complete ban on government use would make more sense at this point. But the fact of the matter remains that Pichai is pointing at those other companies while his works in the shadows with the likes of Facebook and Twitter to socially engineer the human race.<br/>It's no surprise that Pichai's underlying message, one he weaves throughout his entire article, is that the government should regulate his competitors' AI, not his. He wants to win our hearts and minds; he wants us to believe that only Alphabet can save us from the evils of government, the ignorance of the average person, and his competitors. Ultimately, Pichai's call for regulation is a warning against it. In his own words:<br/>We want to be a helpful and engaged partner to regulators as they grapple with the inevitable tensions and trade-offs. We offer our expertise, experience and tools as we navigate these issues together.<br/>AI has the potential to improve billions of lives, and the biggest risk may be failing to do so. By ensuring it is developed responsibly in a way that benefits everyone, we can inspire future generations to believe in the power of technology as much as I do.<br/>We'd argue that endangering billions of lives is a bigger risk than failing to improve them. Pichai's promises to help regulators serve the greater good goes against the boots-on-the-ground reality of the way his companies operate.<br/>Pichai's warning against over-regulation disguised as a 'gee golly' call for regulation echoes the White House's current policy regarding AI - we recently compared this to Ajit Pai's views on net neutrality. In essence, both advocate for a light-touch regulatory approach designed to clear the way for money-making endeavors.<br/>As our own Ivan Mehta stated:<br/>As many have pointed out in the past, it would be a good time to form an independent watchdog consisting of experts in the field to keep a close look over advancements in the field and point out malpractices by the company.<br/>At the end of the day, if you completely trust the Trump administration and Alphabet to decide what's best for the world when it comes to regulating AI, there's nothing to worry about.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-542953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1K-02X1-JBYT-H4C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000288B</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE LUFTHANSA AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Data privacy and regulation are among the issues that could draw bipartisan support, particularly with Democrats assuming control of the House of Representatives in January 2019. </p><p>\"Sundar Pichai's first appearance before Congress went as expected, which is to say not very well,\" said Shane Green, CEO of data management app Digi.me. \"As mild-mannered and thoughtful as he appeared, he simply wasn't going to win any points from the members of the House Judiciary Committee on the issue of transparency, which remains the Achilles heel of Google. The black box nature of so much of what they do and making slippery statements like 'Google does not sell personal data' results in people assuming the worst.\"</p><p>Thus far, Alphabet has avoided many of the scandals that have plagued Facebook  for its handling of user data. But it's likely that Pichai's sprawling testimony could raise more questions as U.S. lawmakers  <br/></p><p>Lawmakers on Tuesday, tried to drill down into the inner workings of Google's search algorithm, even performing live Google searches and asking Pichai to describe how the results were compiled. Congressman Ted Lieu (D-California) Googled two of his colleagues in Congress, Steve Scalise and Steve King, and demonstrated the positive or negative search results of both, concluding that \"if you're getting negative search results, stop doing negative things. Don't blame Google,\" Lieu said. </p><p>Beyond politically-oriented search results, Pichai was also forced to defend Google's approach to gathering and using data, which many have criticized as far too opaque for the average user. </p><p>Google's tracking of user locations -- and how that information affects what results are delivered -- emerged as a focal point the testimony. Recently, Google faced a  charging that its location tracking practices, used to deliver ads, are deceptive to users. And some lawmakers echoed those concerns, suggesting that Google is not transparent enough with how it gathers users' data, and what the data is used for. </p><p>\"Numerous members of Congress specifically asked Mr. Pichai how Google's data collection in regard to location tracking works, and even if switched off in privacy settings, if location information is still being collected,\" noted Dimitri Sirota, CEO of BigID, which helps companies with data privacy compliance. \"Although polite and soft spoken in his responses, it was clear that Mr. Pichai did not have the answers to mitigate these concerns, and he did nothing to slow the inevitable -- Federal regulation curtailing the way companies obtain, use, govern and account for personal information of users.\" </p><p>When asked whether he felt the U.S. needed federal data laws similar to Europe's GDPR, Pichai did say he thought the industry might be \"better off with more of an overarching data protection framework for users.\"</p><p>And although the hearing may have done little to pry open the black box of Google's algorithms, Pichai did make one notable concession.</p><p>Asked if Google or YouTube would be willing to make changes in support of a healthier civic dialogue, even if it meant a drop in engagement, Pichai replied: \"Absolutely Mr. Chairman...we have always focused on long-term goals towards user satisfaction.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GOOGL and FB are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

This week, Midas updates investors on its 'Dogs of the Footsie' portfolio, the Times looks at tech firm IQE, and the Telegraph assesses Royal Mail.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAIL ON SUNDAY\u00a0  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dogs of the Footsie experimental portfolio comprises the ten highest-yielding shares in the FTSE 100 index and we last looked at it in July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back then, the Dogs were riding high, comfortably outperforming the FTSE 100 index. In fact, they doubled in value between 2012 and 2017. Over the past months however, there has been a distinct change in sentiment and performance.</p><p>Our July Dogs comprised oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell, housebuilders Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey, utilities Centrica and SSE, insurer Direct Line, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Mail and moneylender Provident Financial.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Since then, the oil price has risen almost 50 per cent and oil companies have followed in its wake. BP is now around 10 per cent higher at 489p and Shell is almost 14 per cent ahead at 2424p after reporting a surge in fourth quarter profits last week. Both companies leave the Dogs, because dividend yields tend to fall when share prices rise.</p><p>The other two leavers - Provident Financial and Royal Mail - have been booted out of the Dogs because they are no longer in the FTSE 100 index.</p><p>As our portfolio always consists of ten Dogs, we have replaced the four leavers with new pups - insurer Admiral Group, BT, cigarette maker Imperial Brands and Marks &amp; Spencer. All four enter the Dogs because their share prices have fallen (and yields rise when stocks fall).</p><p>Their sorry share price performance reflects individual problems that have been self-inflicted over several years. However, these issues are compounded by regulatory uncertainty, a slowdown in economic growth and structural social shifts.</p><p>Sadly too, shares in the six remaining Dogs have fallen or moved sideways since July.</p><p>In July, the Midas Dogs portfolio was valued at \u00a321,292. Today, it is worth \u00a319,482. The FTSE 100 index has risen since the summer, even after the recent sell-off. A nominal \u00a310,000 invested in the index in March 2012 was worth \u00a312,455 in July. Today, that figure has risen to \u00a312,580.</p><p>The Dogs are still beating the FTSE 100 but the gap is narrowing, hit by lacklustre performances from many of the pups in our portfolio.</p><p>Investors can take a modicum of comfort from the dividend yields. Nine of the ten are now over 6 per cent and four are above 7 per cent, significantly higher than on any Government bond or bank savings rate.</p><p>Looking ahead, some of these dividend promises may come under pressure. For now, the Dogs' disappointing share price performances underline the challenges that British firms face in today's troubled economic and political environment.</p><p>  &gt;&gt;&gt;Read the full Midas column here\u00a0 </p><p>THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH\u00a0 </p><p>A bitter battle over staff pensions has been central to Royal Mail's fortunes since Questor's Income Portfolio bought the stock in October 2016. Now the tale has taken another turn.</p><p>Last week the postal group averted a strike planned by the Communications Workers Union by reaching an agreement over a brand new type of pension scheme.</p><p>So-called \"collective defined contribution\" arrangements represent a third way between final salary schemes and \"money purchase\" plans, where employees bear all the risk.</p><p>In December an independent mediator recommended the establishment of a \"collective\" scheme that would share risk between the company and staff.</p><p>Cost savings will be less impressive than would have been achieved by a wholesale switch to a money purchase scheme but they will still be substantial: the closure of the final salary scheme means costs will be about \u00a3400m a year, compared with a projected \u00a31bn or more without the changes. Money will also be saved by avoiding a lengthy strike.</p><p>The plans are being put to staff in the coming weeks and may even require new legislation, a tricky task in today's Brexit-filled parliamentary agenda. Yet if approved the plans will give Royal Mail and investors far greater certainty over the level of future expenditure.</p><p>Questor bought Royal Mail at 455p; yesterday afternoon it stood at 470p. More importantly, our \u00a320,000 investment has yielded \u00a31,350 in income so far.</p><p>With the pension dispute fading into the rear-view mirror, those dividends looks a great deal more sustainable. Resolving the pension issue will also allow the group to make further inroads into Europe.</p><p>THE SUNDAY TIMES\u00a0 </p><p>In recent years IQE, the Cardiff semiconductor firm, has started to look like Britain's next big tech thing.</p><p>Founded in 1988 and floated in 2000, it meandered along at a middling pace. Until last year, that is, when speculation about its silicon wafers finding their way into the next-generation iPhone sent the shares soaring.</p><p>That meteoric rise caught the eye of short-sellers, whose interest has leapt in the past six months on fears that sales of Apple's iPhone X will disappoint - and deflate IQE's bubble. By the end of last week, 21% of the shares were out on loan, a proxy for short interest, according to Markit data.</p><p>On Friday a little-known short-selling outfit run by former research analyst Matt Earl went for the jugular. ShadowFall Capital and Research published a note claiming IQE appears reliant on two joint ventures - one in Cardiff, another in Singapore - for a substantial chunk of its profits: 42% in 2015 and 30% in 2016.</p><p>Yet ShadowFall said IQE's relationship with these joint ventures is a \"somewhat circular state of affairs\" - their only customer appears to be IQE itself.</p><p>The attack added to a recent sell-off in IQE shares, which fell 3.3% to 104.4p, valuing it at \u00a3788m.</p><p>Earl has pedigree. He called out social housing company Connaught before its collapse, and persistently criticised Mitie before its 2016 and 2017 profit warnings. His warning on IQE is worth heeding. It is one tech darling I'd give a wide berth. Avoid.</p><p>                     What you need to know each week: The This is Money podcast\u00a0                   </p><p>Want to know the most important things you need to know about money each week, what has caught our interest and what made us laugh?

This is so scary. </p><p>It's awful. Yeah. Such a concern. in a vulnerable place. I worry that it places children they could end up getting groomed. It puts children in a place where of what's normal behaviour. It's the impact on their idea Aside from the wording, it's the fact that it's normalising the taking of pictures and posting them online, you know, and perhaps asking for them... for sending to one another And that's not good. pledged to make Britain the safest The Conservative Government has but it's been criticised place in the world to be online, for dragging its heels on implement in any kind of legislation. for better education for parents There is cross-party support to protect their children in the digital age, on internet service providers. and for more restrictions So where does the law stand? These images that are posted online, I mean, they are quite graphic, below is encouraging quite but they are legal and the text high risk behaviour. But that's quite legal as well? Yes, ostensibly, it's a picture which is in itself not illegal to post. So if I was to be outside and that picture to be displayed, certainly an offence, then that would probably constitute possibly a public order offence. Because, effectively, the images that we are looking at are kind of... Amateur porn. For all intents and purposes, yes. the context and where they are put. And again, it's all about to clamp down on that level And the reality is trying they say, likely to be very poor use of amateur material is, of resources and frankly, very difficult to do. can really interfere with that is, The extent to which the legislation at this stage. in my view, relatively doubtful is taught in most schools Online safety for children controls that can be put in place and there are parental distressing content. to stop young people from seeing But images we've come across may not necessarily be blocked. Several charities are calling on the Government to do much more spaces, as it's become to protect children in digital an avenue for exploitation. about the risks of online grooming. We are particularly concerned So we have released new statistics showing that in the south-east, there has been around 250 cases in the last nine months of offences and have received sexual messages where children have been contacted by an adult. simply are not doing enough. And the reality is that the firms and that is only going to happen now We need to see a culture shift up and regulate. if we do see the Government step So, who do you think should be regulating this? I think it's twofold. I think they need to be fined heavily in order to make them do all companies have got some kind something about it but I would hope of morality to them, you hope. people will find a way of getting The problem is, in any society, around the laws and restrictions and what have you. And so, you know, the Government or the powers that be must always be one step ahead if they can. thought there, scary, We heard what the mums the word right at the beginning. explicit images, then, Damian Collins, these graphic they're on sites anyone can use, so no age restrictions are going to block them. or no parental blocks Are you... I mean, you can't be comfortable with that being out there? Well, no, nobody is. And the current changes that have been brought about, some of the sites, age verification for are consequences of that concern. There is also the internet safety strategy which was created by the Digital Economy Act, passed last year, which is in at the legal liabilities that consultation at the moment to look tech companies, could be established for major which could be the avenues companies like Facebook and distribute links to material through which people try obligations should they have to try like this, to say, what legal and stop this content getting out there and to act to take it down and should they be fined or block links to it, if they fail to do that? platforms, which is most people's Because I believe these big tech need to have a greater gateway to what's online, for the content they share. sense of responsibility We'll come back to that and the strategy in just a moment. to what you just saw and the fact First, Rosie, your reaction any of our kids, we're all parents, that this is, you know, on that so easily. they could stumble Yeah. who are sort of older, I mean, I've got two teenagers but I was definitely warned when they both started secondary that they would see porn school, we were all warned on their phone and it was just... A fact of life? We had to accept it, yeah. As a single parent, especially, I didn't really know how to tackle that.

What difference will it actually make practically to ask? What will get better? It enables us to plan public services better. </p><p>One of the points about a smart city, that it is all about corporate control, our plan is about taking the technology and putting it into the hands of citizens, it shouldn't just be private companies and their relationship with consumers, it's about access to information, designing services better. We are adopting the latest techniques to put users right at the centre of how we design public services, it is a radical new approach which means a break from the past but allows us to not just static public services that change every few years but services which can change according to people's NEETs and add is a really significant break from the past of how we have done in public services. But this is just talk. At the end the day, there is no money, it's not that City Hall is going to be doing anything, it is going to try to enable others to provide... City Hall is investing in crucial initiatives, firstly, a large amount of money in data sharing between London's 32 boroughs, #400,000 this year in data sharing and we also have the residual city data store, renowned across the world for its open data sets. TFL's work as well. Data sharing between the Barras is crucial and we as secondary setting up ways to collaborate, not big tech, not just big tech, but it will mobilise the tech community across London, large or small. Jamie, who hold the ring here? I am beginning to think big tech is a lot bigger now than in big Government and we have seen this in many areas where governments have tried to tax some huge multinational IT companies, are they now reaching the stage where for all these efforts by City Hall and others, they're a bit part players in the game where the big tech giants are driving things? I think that is the struggle between governments and large technology companies, especially international ones, which are much harder to regulate. In the last six months, Government? Have started to push back and you have seen them being bolder and aggressive, select committees... The Marriott hotel saga, which we have just seen, 500 million people's data seems to have been accessed. This is the thing that worries me. There are great benefits to connecting things and collecting more data but the more you connect things up, the more vulnerable they become to being hacked. There is no doubt that in my mind, in five years, we will see devices, traffic lights, bits of critical national infrastructure, which will be hacked into and don't think we're quite ready for that yet. Inventing the Government is ready, I do think the City of London is ready for that yet and so I hope we could focus much more on this. It will get worse before it gets better. Let's bring in the politicians. Teresa Pearce, from your perspective, how does Government even begin to hold the ring? It is difficult because technology moves quickly. Government and politics moves slowly. We are playing catch up. Did you think Government can catch up? They have to, because this is a threat to security in many respects and data is important because without it you cannot plan and the work that TfL does, on trips people make and how they make them, is good for practical things and I love technology but I wanted to do what I wanted to do, it often tries to tell me what I want to do, so it is about who controls the technology. One thing the Government could do is inflict financial pain of companies if they want access to all this information. We have seen Government? So far being frankly feeble in trying to tax some of these massive multinational global IT companies. Isn't that stage one of the Government getting serious? We do need further action to ensure digital giants pay taxes. We have seen progress in the budget. One of the problems with that is to fix this problem effectively we need global action. Because essentially it derives from an international area but we are making progress on that. Government does absolutely need to get tough on big digital</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-fe1467d9abeb4549bc44d666ee076f70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TW2-RRB1-DY08-34MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Secretary Scalia notes the fundamentals of the economy and employment are strong, yet the restraining factor remains rules &amp;#38; regulations against economic growth instituted by state governors. At this point in the politics of COVID it seems abundantly clear how fear is being used as a weapon by an alliance of media, government bureaucrats, politicians &amp;#38; left-wing activists. Our nation appears frozen in a perpetual state of Orwellian dysfunction; as the resistance extremists continue weaponizing fear (never letting a crisis to to waste[1]) to advance a transparent political objective.[embedded content] </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/labor-secretary-scalia.jpg\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/labor-secretary-scalia.jpg</url> In order to support the most important political objectives of the DNC writ large in the 2020 election, COVID-19 hype is essential: Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot easily achieve 'mail-in' voting; which they desperately need in key battleground states in order to control the outcome. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot shut down rallies and political campaigning efforts of President Trump; which they desperate need to do in key battleground states. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot block the campaign contrast between an energetic President Trump and a physically tenuous, mentally compromised, challenger. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats do not have an excuse for cancelling the DNC convention in Milwaukee; thereby blocking Team Bernie Sanders from visible opposition while protecting candidate gibberish from himself. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats do not have a mechanism to keep voters isolated from each-other; limiting communication and national debate adverse to their interests. COVID-19 panic pushes the national conversation into the digital space where Big Tech controls every element of the conversation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/zogby-poll-biden-dementia.jpgWithout\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/zogby-poll-biden-dementia.jpgWithout</url> COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot keep their Blue state economies easily shut-down and continue to block U.S. economic growth.

Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot easily keep club candidate Joe Biden sealed in the basement; where the electorate is not exposed to visible signs of his dementia. Without COVID-19 panic it becomes more difficult for Big Tech to censor voices that would outline the fraud and scheme. With COVID-19 panic they have a better method and an excuse. Without COVID-19 panic Democrats cannot advance, influence, or organize their preferred presidential debate format, a 'virtual presidential debate' series. [Comrade Gretchen Whitmer knows this plan, hence she cancelled the Michigan venue] All of these, and more, strategic outcomes are based on the manufactured weaponization of the COVID-19 virus to achieve a larger political objective. There is ZERO benefit to anyone other than Democrats for the overwhelming hype surrounding COVID-19. It is not coincidental that all corporate media are all-in to facilitate the demanded fear that Democrats need in order to achieve their objectives. Thus there is an alignment of all big government institutions and multinationals to support the same. Nothing is coincidental. Everything is political. <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/corporate_liar_1.jpg\">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/corporate_liar_1.jpg</url> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2020/07/02/explosive-about-all-these-new-positive-covid-cases-state-health-departments-manipulating-data-changing-definitions/\">https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2020/07/02/explosive-about-all-these-new-positive-covid-cases-state-health-departments-manipulating-data-changing-definitions/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ATOM127393159399035741925876100210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATOM-127393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6094-5P31-F03R-N14Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>11:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Conservative Treehouse</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>media bias</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Occupy Type Moonbats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election 2020</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dem Hypocrisy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Uncategorized</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DECC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;

The sources insisted on anonymity because the discussions were confidential.</p><p>Several analysts said they believe an agreement for IBM to buy Sun is still possible, despite IBM's earlier withdrawal of an offer valued at roughly $7 billion.</p><p>\"There is economic upside\" for both companies, said Ashok Kumar, who follows the tech industry for the Collins Stewart investment firm. \"If there is a meeting of minds, the deal can still happen.\"</p><p>But he said an agreement is probably much more important to Sun, which has been struggling far more than most big tech companies in the current recession. Kumar said IBM, which is bigger and has continued to post profits, doesn't need Sun.</p><p>Representatives of both companies declined to comment, as they have since reports of the negotiations surfaced last month. Talks broke down after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on price and other terms.</p><p>Both companies sell software and computers, including servers and other hardware for big corporate data centers. Acquiring Sun would give IBM a dominant position in the high-end server market, which has prompted suggestions that the deal might raise antitrust issues. Sun has pressed IBM for assurances that it would not abandon the deal if U.S. or European regulators insisted on an extensive review or set conditions for legal approval.</p><p>IBM, meanwhile, reportedly has balked at some of Sun's contracts with its top executives, which guarantee sizable payouts if the company is sold.</p><p>Speculation has swirled since the talks broke down. CNBC, citing unnamed sources, said Thursday that IBM was no longer interested in a deal. But the sources who spoke to the Mercury News said neither company had completely shut the door on further talks, although there has been no further movement.</p><p>When talks stalled April 5, Sun notified IBM that it was ending its exclusive negotiating agreement and would consider itself free to approach other buyers. However, no other suitors have emerged.</p><p>\"I really do not see any other bidders coming to the table at this time,'' said Bill Kreher, a tech industry analyst with the Edward Jones investment firm. \"I think Sun recognizes that IBM may be its best bet here.''</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bbailey@mercurynews.com\">bbailey@mercurynews.com</email> or 408-920-5022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-12158997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VG9-0HF0-Y9NC-P0PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 16, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002M1D</classCode><className>EDWARD D JONES &amp; CO LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00099OJ</classCode><className>COLLINS STEWART HAWKPOINT PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp; COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT &amp; SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6159 MISC.

Good morning to you.  Happy Tuesday, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Alphabet stock under pressure this morning, the parent company of Google, reporting strong fourth quarter results, but it was the expense side of the business, spending concerns dragging on the stock this morning.  We're taking a closer look at that.  Plus the other companies on tap including Disney today.  Earnings round-up coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking bread, Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, having dinner with President Trump at the White House last night on Jay Powell's birthday.  The details coming up right here.  Countdown to State of the Union, President Trump set to tout his economic success tonight.  We're taking a closer look at who will be attending as guests of the President and the Democrats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Patriots on parade.  The team celebrating its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning, following not-so super ratings for the big game.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets right now.  Take a look at futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow industrials right now up better than 70 points, a quarter of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 up 3-1/2, and the NASDAQ right now looking like it gained at the start of trading of about 11 points, this after the market started the week on a strong note.  Big cap technology and industrial stocks led big a rally yesterday, take a look, the Dow industrials up 175 points at the close yesterday, up three quarters of a percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18 and the NASDAQ, with all those tech names there, up better than one percent, 84 points higher at the close yesterday.</p><p>Earnings season rolling on this morning with Google parent company, Alphabet, reporting after the bell last night.  The numbers were better than expected last night, but the concerns are really over higher expenses and that's weighing on investors this morning.  Company is spending more money on a whole host of businesses away from search.  The stock down 2-1/2 right now this morning.  Viacom, Walt Disney, and Snap all reporting today.</p><p>And joining me right now is Wells Fargo Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist, Brian Jacobsen.  Brian, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here.  So characterize, assess for us the fourth-quarter earnings period so far from your standpoint.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Sure.  From our standpoint, it looks like the real story here isn't that it's a lot better than people expected, it's just that it could have been a lot worse.  I think that with the December drubbing that we had with the equity markets, a lot of it was around rising risks of recession.  But now those risks appear to be receding as we that about anywhere from 70 to 75 percent of companies that have reported have actually beat estimates depending upon, you know, which data provider you look at to get earnings estimates.</p><p>So, so far so good.  And our expectation is that we're going to continue to see this economic expansion continue.  And so we're continuing to favor more cyclical areas of the market, you know, the run-up with industrials and technology, to us isn't really all that surprising mainly because we thought that the market was overplaying the risks of recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, because the risk of recession seems to be -- the commentary is getting louder and louder.  But we know from a fundamental basis we saw earnings up better than 20 percent in 2018, 22 percent or something, and we're expecting earnings to be up, what, four percent, six percent.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  They're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that concern you that we're going to see such a slowdown and profitability?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Well, that doesn't happen all that often, but there is something somewhat unique about last year's numbers, is the fact that you did have tax cut, which probably contributed, you know, somewhere between anywhere from 10 to 11 percentage points to EPS growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  So part of it was a one-off with tax cuts.  But we don't think that now we're going to see a rolling over of earnings.  So, what I like to do when you do have these one-off effects like with tax cuts is really look at topline earnings growth as more of an indicator of the underlying strength of businesses, and there, that's still looking pretty healthy, about eight percent year-on-year expectations for the 12 months is something closer to around maybe fix to six percent, which is still pretty good, so it's nothing close to some people are talking about an earnings recession, where you have corporate profits falling, but the economy's still kind of trudging along.  We don't think we're going to see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  The Fed, that's certainly one of the big stories for this market, a real pivot at the end of last year where the Fed told us at the beginning of this year as well, \"Look, we are going to wait, we're going to -- it's going to be data-dependent, they may very well not raise at all this year and maybe we're even going to see them pullback on the balance sheet.  Fed Chairman Powell dined with the President last night.  Does that concern you?  I mean in terms of the Fed's independence given the President's stance on the Fed for so long now?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  It doesn't, and it's mainly because I think that the data justifies the pivot by the Fed.  One of our big concerns going into the last part of 2018 was that the Federal Reserve was going to hike because they could, not because they should.  There was, to us clear, evidence that the housing market had been suffering for a lot of 2018, that you had a lot of somewhat tightening of financial conditions and so I think that without the clear and present danger of inflation picking up, there's really no reason for the Fed to continue hiking as it was, so they're probably closer to being done than they are more towards the mid part of the game as far as with rate hikes.  So, it wasn't really too surprising that they made the pivot, but the markets sure did cheer that on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does the State of the Union matter to investors?  Is there anything that you would anticipate is said tonight at the State of the Union that could move markets tomorrow?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Well, I think that there are a few things that we could see, you know, if there's any sort of policy statement about, you know, let's say anything with drug pricing, or with -- the opioid epidemic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Good point, yes.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  But otherwise, I think that we're going to be really looking for any teasers about trade policy.  It seems like the talks have gone well so far and President Trump and President Xi are going to be meeting at the end of February so is he going to outline what some of those agreements are that they've come to?  But then otherwise, probably going to focus on immigration and the border wall, which, from an investor perspective, probably isn't as meaningful except if it leads to further government shutdowns in the context of a debt ceiling debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I think the most recent shutdown didn't really impact the markets much because it was partial, and also we weren't dealing with trying to raise the debt ceiling.  Future ones, we may not be so lucky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's great point.  And real quick before you go, Disney and Viacom, any thoughts on those earnings today?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I don't have any really view on those --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I don't cover those.  Those are up to our analysts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brian, it's great to see you.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Great to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Brian Jacobsen, great insights from you as always from Wells Fargo.  Meanwhile, the Patriots' victory parade is this morning.  You know it was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history.  Also generating the game's lowest T.V. ratings in a decade.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  What's your take here?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, lame commercials, Maroon, as this -- the half-time performers, and then a game about as interesting as watching your gran papi mow the lawn, that is why this Super Bowl was a ratings loser.  98.2 million people watched the Patriots beat the Rams, that is the smallest television audience since 2008 when the Giants beat the Patriots, we all remember that around New York City, that was a five percent drop in the ratings from last year, a 12 percent drop om ratings from the Super Bowl in 2017.  Now 2.6 million people did stream the game across digital platforms.  That is a digital record for viewership.  It pushed the total audience above that 100 million mark, but this game needed it because people watching on T.V., a lot of them didn't show up, particular Los Angeles.</p><p>The ratings were weak for the Rams and down in New Orleans, the folks down there, the Saints fans upset, about that blown call that if they had gotten it right would have sent the Saints to the Super Bowl.  That city had the lowest ratings for New Orleans in Super Bowl history.  However, this Super Bowl and the rating, the poor ratings, cap a year where ratings have come back for the sport.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Before Sunday's game, ratings were up nine percent during the playoffs, five percent during regular season.  It was people like Patrick Mahomes, people were --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- tuning in to watch him play, and Roger Goodell having a lower profile this past --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  That's what I was going to say, Dagen, because I feel like over the last several months, the hoopla and the upset of the kneeling issue and concussions sort of went down.  And I thought, \"Well, maybe this is, you know, viewed are coming back.\"  Not so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- well, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your numbers won't show it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were during the season, but again when you put up a game that was this awful to watch --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- where both -- neither offense really showed up.  You can argue that it was all about the defense, no, it was just boring and people, well, went and did other things like, I don't know, groom their cats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God, you're tough.  Thank you, Dagen.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  Meanwhile, President Trump is expected to announce some key nominations today.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The President is expected to nominate Treasury Department Official, David Malpass, to be next leader of the World Bank.  He is one of the World Bank's sharpest critics within the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.  Now the U.S. holds a controlling share of the bank's board voting power.  And the President plans to nominate Former Energy Lobbyist, David Bernhardt, as Secretary of the Interior.  Democrats and environmental groups have criticized that decision saying he is vulnerable to conflicts of interest.</p><p>President Trump's Inaugural Committee says it will comply with the subpoena from Federal Prosecutors.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the Feds requesting documents related to spending and donations as well as information about benefits donors received from making contributions including tickets and photo opportunities with the President.  Prosecutors also want documents related to donations made by foreign nationals.  The committee raised a record-breaking $107 million, that leading up to the 2017 inauguration.</p><p>Amazon has named another African American to its mainly white board.  Rosalind Brewer will become the second black female director for Amazon.  She is Starbucks' Chief Operating Officer.  The move comes as companies come under pressure to diversify their corporate boardrooms.  Shares of Amazon are lower just fractionally in premarket trading at 16.33 a share, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you.  Coming up, the State of the Union is tonight.  President Trump will deliver the speech after postponing it a week due to the shutdown.  The key issues he hopes to tackle, plus his special guests right after this.  And then crypto secret, nearly $200 million in cryptocurrency cannot be accessed because the only person with the password is no longer alive.  He passed away.  The stunning story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We got a big program this morning.  Coming up, California Congressman, House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, here in the studio.  Pennsylvania Congressman, and House Foreign Affairs Committee member, Scott Perry, here as well.  RNC Chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, joining me along with FOX News Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane, here.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>We are also counting down to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to address the country, highlighting some key issues that Americans face.  Plus touting his economic success so far under his leadership.  Joining the conversation this morning is 32 Advisors CEO, Former Economic Advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf here.  Along with CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, great to see you guys this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So what should the President tackle tonight, Robert?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I agree.  He should focus on the economy, which has been incredibly strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, he's going to have to go there on the combination of immigration, government shutdown, and talk about the deal he wants.  My guess is half will stand, half will sit down.  And I think he is going to have to talk about foreign policy because it seems like there's republicans that's starting not to basically agree with where he is on Syria.  So, I think it's going to be a very interesting, you know, State of the Union.  I know it's a week later than we were expecting, but I think it's always important to hear the President.</p><p>BELL:  I think the timing of this is really good, too.  After the government shutdown, this is a chance for President Trump to potentially regain some momentum, especially after the loss he incurred during that and really lay out the plan, like you said, with regards to immigration policy going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we are expecting a slowdown.  Is that largely because of the rest of the world, do you think?  Is it because this expansion is going on 10 years, or is it something domestically in the U.S.?  I mean I know housing has been a weak spot.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I mean I think of course the rest of the world is slowing down.  And when China and Europe are slowing down, that is going to have an impact on our economy.  But also we're cycling the sugar high of tax reform, fiscal policy, deregulation, so it's hard to comp on top of those numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  Tough comparisons.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, it is.  We're -- we went off an incurably low base a decade ago, and now all of a sudden it's off a higher base and we're starting to see hourly earnings get better, wages get better, GDP get better, but the question is are we on the backend of that 10-year recovery, and it -- you know, listen, we have 50 percent of the economists saying so, but we have seen 50 percent of them be wrong many, many times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump needs to talk about his strategy to keep this economy going and maybe get out of the way of it because, again, some of the administration's policies have put a damper on American business, the steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place, and the exemptions weren't even getting processed during the government shutdown.  He needs to lay out a two-year agenda on how he's going to keep the economy growing at a three percent rate.</p><p>By the way last year three percent plus rate, even though we haven't gotten the final, final numbers for the year, but that's the fastest since 2005.  He has to continue that because voters have very short-term memories if he wants to get reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is he going to do that?  I mean are there --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- areas in terms of policy that there's common ground or are we going to see the next two years resist, resist, resist?  There are some Democrats who have already said, \"I'm not going.\"  Meaning he's over here.  The President is also expected to make a call for unity tonight.  Unity.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK?  Amid these massive divisions between the Republicans and the Democrats.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  The -- listen, the environment is more polarizing than it's ever been, you know.  Since the midterms, there's no question that the Democratic Party has had a shift to the left.  The biggest voices are more populist, whether it's Cortez or Priestley, or -- and there's a big push to the left.  On the flip side, those who won in the Republican Party definitely a much more of the more conservative far-right base, so we've lost the center and we -- it would be great for all of us if we got the center back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think about Howard Schultz?  Is he the answer?</p><p>WOLF:  You know, Howard Schultz, for me, is not the answer.  I mean I like some of his policies, and if -- I wish he ran as a Democrat.  I'm not one who's touring for an independent third party.  I don't think it's where the country is right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that he will take votes from the Dems?</p><p>WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I think his -- he literally aligns with the Democrats 95 percent of the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he does.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I think that's a real problem for the Democrats going forward into 2020 and I think that the polarization of the country really is going to get people out there and voting this time around, too, I think.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But shouldn't the Dems just recognize that?  If much of the country is in the center like you are leaning to the left or leaning to the right, why can't the Democrats understand that and not have the loudest people in the room, those who want Medicare-for-all, abolish ICE, 70 percent tax rates like AOC?</p><p>WOLF:  I think what's fascinating is if actually you looked at the midterms, the Democrats did best in the moderate areas.  And if you look at most recent polling, actually the Democratic Party wants over 50 percent actually shift to the center, but it doesn't really make a difference what polling says.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  The excitement and the electricity in the party is shifted to the left.  That's where -- that's why I've always said the likely candidate for the Democratic Party who could win a primary will have a tougher time in the national election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Good point.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's call -- let's talk about unity, though.  The Criminal Justice Reform, signed into law by President Trump, it had bipartisan support.  One of the guests at the State of the Union from the President tonight will be Matthew Charles, the first man released from prison under this.  I think that he's also going to have Alice Johnson there whose sentence was commuted by President Trump.  This is something that the Democrats should be cheering more loudly than they are right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But because it's President Trump they're not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- I think people are going to get frustrated with all of this constant resist.  I mean, are the women going to wear all white?</p><p>WOLF:  I don't know what they're wearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More games.  Why can't we just work together?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am most interested to watch the face of Nancy Pelosi --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Behind President Trump, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this entire State of the Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope she rehearses stoicism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So -- because, again, it's going to be --</p><p>BELL:  It's the sign of that resist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's going to be -- that's going to be the thing that we're all talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're going to watch it right here as FOX Business --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- is going to have live coverage of President Trump's State of the Union tonight.  It all kicks off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  The President will speak at 9:00 p.m. and we'll be watching both Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Pence behind the President and, of course, focused on the President's speech.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. with the highlights from the speech and a whole host of terrific guests.</p><p>I'll be sitting down with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, tomorrow, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for this exclusive tomorrow morning from Washington with the Secretary of State right here.  Coming up first, the war on terror, we're talking about it next.  The Pentagon is warning about the future of ISIS in Syria as the senate votes to keep troops there on the ground defying President Trump.  The debate coming up.  Then Hawaii may say aloha to smoking.  The interesting way the state wants to phase out the sale of cigarettes next up right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. .  Headlines across America this morning.  The Hawaii Tribune-Herald writing a Local Representative Richard Creagan is proposing a cigarette ban.  The bill is aimed at stopping the sale of cigarettes by increasing the minimum age to buy them --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to 100 years.  The age would be slowly increased over several years starting at 30 years old in 2020, 40 in 2021, and then 100 by 2024.  Over to the Chicago Tribune, it's reporting today is O'Hare is once again the nation's busiest airport in terms of total flights.  O'Hare International reclaimed the titled from Atlanta for the first time since 2014.  In total, there were over 900,000 thousand flights in and out of O'Hare just last year.  Finally from The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia is considering banning cashless stores.  Philly City Council will consider a bill today that would prevent stores from refusing to accept cash and prevent stores from charging people more if they pay with cash.</p><p>Interesting stories here in the headlines across America.  What do you think that's all about in Philly?  I mean I'm wondering if facial recognition is -- people are looking at it and giving it second thoughts.</p><p>WOLF:  I don't like the idea of cashless stores because I think people don't really use their credit cards that well, right?  And they don't realize they're paying 18, 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true, yes.</p><p>WOLF:  So I think actually, you know, everyone thinks it's for free until they start getting their invoices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't know how much you're spending.</p><p>WOLF:  So, I'm a little nervous about that.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, but I feel like it's the way that technology is taking us.  I mean you have on your iPhone Apple Pay and all these things, people are using Venmo more and more often.  I just feel like it's the way the world --</p><p>WOLF:  But people -- but the other side is you're giving more of your information when people want to start going the other way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  That's fair.  That's fair.</p><p>WOLF:  I mean -- I mean the whole privacy thing -- great, we're going to have 10 more apps on our phone that has everything we do every step of the way.  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are some small businesses that don't want to accept cash.  All you need is a Square account and the Square app and you just a do swipe.  You even use your -- even use your mobile device --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to ring up customers.  So why force small business owners to accept cash?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People have the right to not shop there.  It's not a -- it -- we're not talking about supermarkets and drugstores, I doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  By the way, you mentioned, you know, the data, that's why China is number one in A.I. because of all of the data that it has collected about people.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I mean we were talking offset.  I think one of the most important things that the President's going to say tonight is where he is with China.  What's important is the tariff and trade, where is it with intellectual property.  On the flip side, he knows he wants to put an olive branch out there because March 1st is kind of the deadline before tariffs go up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  So he's got to figure out how he wants to thread the needle between hitting them publicly, but also not hitting them too hard during the negotiation.  It will be interesting what he does, but obviously intellectual property is the big elephant in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.</p><p>WOLF:  It's not about steel and trade and tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get into this because if they do a deal that just allows China to buy more stuff -- yesterday, China said that it is poised to buy more soybean and grain, and then leave I.P. and the forced transfer if technology on the cutting room floor, big trouble.  Big -- that is a big issue and we'll talk about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm still asking the question why are the steel and aluminum tariffs still in place if you've gotten the deal with Mexico and Canada and you're on the road to doing something about China, why are they still there.  And stop talking about them as a revenue generator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me just say, because I've asked this question of the administration and they will say if we don't have steel and aluminum tariffs all over, China will find the opening, and they will push through steel through Canada or somewhere else, that's what the administration will say.  We had to do it everywhere including our friends because otherwise there will be open pockets where China will push their product.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're wildly overselling that threat.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I would respectfully --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wildly overselling that threat.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I would respectfully disagree.</p><p>BELL:  And it's -- and it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  Make sure I'm being respectful.  Respectful disagree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's the putting the screws to American manufacturers and costing people jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big impact.  Big impact.  All right.  Quick break, and then staying in Iraq, that is the question.  President Trump outlines the plan to keep eye on Iran from Iraq, but politicians there are pushing back.  We've got the details coming up.  And then it's World Nutella Day, yes, it is.  How you can score some free jars with your name on it, this and more right after this, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 5th, your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Big names reporting earnings today, Viacom will be out in about half an hour, investors are also keeping an eye on Disney and Snap, reporting later today.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are looking to extend a winning streak this morning, Futures indicating another start that is strong this morning, Dow industrials up better than 90 points right now, about a third of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 is up s6, a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 18.</p><p>Even though we are seeing some weakness in companies like Alphabet, after its earnings last night, the major indices finished at the highest close in two months yesterday.  Take a look at yesterday's close, with the Dow Industrials picked up 175 points, 3 quarters of 1 percent, the S&amp;P 500 was up 18, that was two-thirds of a percent, and the NASDAQ with 83-point rally yesterday, up better than 1 percent.</p><p>I mentioned Alphabet, it is down, even though the numbers were better-than-expected, the company is seeing higher expenses, we'll talk about it coming up.</p><p>European indices this morning, look like this, and they are higher across the board, FT 100 up 1-1/2 percent right now, 106 points higher in London, CAC Quarante in Paris is up better than 1 percent, 54 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 142 points, one and a quarter percent higher this morning, big winners in Europe, today.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the indices are, well, largely closed for the lunar holiday, it is the Chinese New Year.  Japan was down by just a fraction.</p><p>We are on the countdown to tonight's State of the Union Address, with the guest list expanding on all sides.  President Trump is expected to call for unity in tonight's address.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Most importantly, in the State of the Union, the President is calling for an end to, sort of, resistance in retribution politics and calling for cooperation and compromise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  FOX Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight.  We all start it off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern tonight, with Lou Dobbs.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning in Washington with special guests.</p><p>I will be speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning, join us for that special interview, as we take a look at the President's foreign policy with the Secretary of State tomorrow, live from Washington.</p><p>Plus this, crypto mistake, Canada's largest exchange locked out of more than $130 million worth of crypto currency, because the only person who can access it has died.  He's the only person that had the password, we will tell you about that.  Then, spreading joy, it is World Nutella Day, and we will tell you how you can score your own Nutella, free jar with your name on it, all coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, troop withdrawal backlash, the Senate has voted to oppose President Trump's troop withdrawal in Syria and Afghanistan.  And the measure says that ISIS is still posing a serious threat.  And if the U.S. leaves, it opens the door for Russia and Iran to gain power in the region.</p><p>Joining me right now is Retired Four-Star General and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane, General, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I assume you were pleased with the Senate action yesterday, defying the President, but at the same time, putting out the case that maybe it's too soon to leave, what's your take?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, certainly, they're expressing concern over this withdrawal decision.  The President himself has tried to condition this withdrawal based on making certain that ISIS is truly defeated and does not re-emerge to protect the Kurds and three, to contain the Iranian land bridge that's in Southern Syria, and all of them had the oil fields.</p><p>Those conditions frankly, I think, would meet most of the senators' concerns, if they're actually executed.  I think they're reacting to the initial decision that the President made.  And the Pentagon's I.G. report came out just recently, saying that ISIS has the capability to re-emerge in 6 to 12 months, after the territory has been taken away from them, if we don't keep up the pressure on them.</p><p>And, Maria, the best way to keep the pressure on ISIS in Eastern Syria is to make certain that we control the air space, that we -- that's the British, United States and France doing that, and we have to have some people on the ground to facilitate the use of air power, not all of the 2,200 we have now, but the military (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And we do that, we can truly keep the pressure on ISIS and prevent from re-emerging, because we've got 60,000 local Syrian fighters who are on the ground against ISIS.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, I know that ISIS has certainly become a lot weaker in the last two years, but assess the situation of what could happen if the U.S. does, in fact, withdraw completely from Syria and Afghanistan, is the big worry that Iran moves in?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Iran will likely take over the oil fields in Eastern Syria with 70 percent of the oil in Syria.  You have to repair some of them because they've been damaged by conflict.  They will use that to finance the war in Syria which they are doing right now out of their own treasury.</p><p>And, of course, the President is slapping sanctions on them that are truly having some impact.  It would also open up a land bridge all the way through Syria for them that they've been wanting for years.  They fly a lot of their weapons into Damascus airport that they use in Lebanon, and they want to put small little bases in Syria to encroach on Israel's security.</p><p>So, containing Iran is certainly not letting them Syria as a strategic anchor, not letting them encroach on Israel's security.  And I think we can do that without a considerable amount of troops involved in that process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to Iraq, because the U.S. now could be looking to stay in Iraq.  Listen to what the President said in an interview on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  One of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran, because Iran is a real problem.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN, MODERATOR OF FACE THE NATION, CBS NEWS:  Whoa, that's news, you're keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran?</p><p>TRUMP:  No, because I want to be able to watch Iran, all I want to do is be able to watch.  We have an unbelievable and expensive military base spilt in Iraq.  It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, General?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, we are also -- we are already doing that clandestinely.  And the reality is, Iran is the malign actor in the Middle East.  Their presence in Iraq is somewhat formidable.  They've built Shiite militia brigades by the tens of thousands on them and train them, certainly, that would supposedly to take ISIS down, but it gives them leverage over the Iraqi government.</p><p>They put money in the pockets of Iraqi government leaders and every single opportunity they try to undermine the United States' position in Iraq and then the Middle East where at large.  Certainly, that air base that we have there also it's where our counterterrorism guys operate that's well known.</p><p>Clearly, it's a place that's a treasure for us in terms of resources and capability.  I think the President's issue is, could they impact, use that base to impact on things in Syria, the answer to that, of course, is yes, we could operate out of that and conduct some operations in Syria.</p><p>But I think it's the daily presence assisting the local fighters and making certain that we can still deliver air power, as I mentioned before, is going to be decisive in making certain that ISIS does not re-emerge and Iran does not take over Eastern Syria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, General, before you go, your reaction to this administration's stance on Venezuela?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think they are right on the mark.  The President has made up his mind to facilitate a regime change, to do that peacefully.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  -- and certainly, to support the new government that announced itself in President Guaido, and do everything that we can to put additional pressure on the Maduro regime and also to assist in moving the military leaders who are in the pocket of the regime, away from that regime.  That is the decisive move that's taken place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, joining us.  All discussions, topics for tomorrow, FOX Business will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, all the way until 11:00.</p><p>We will also be live tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live from Washington, with highlights of the speech, and I'll be sitting down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that special exclusive interview tomorrow morning with the Secretary of State.</p><p>First, though, this, ESPN fires an anchor over leaks to the media, Lauren Simonetti with the details, Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, Maria, ESPN's rising star, Adnan Virk, has been fired by that network.  He's accused of leaking confidential company information to the media about the network's baseball coverage.</p><p>Reports say that Virk also is uncooperative when ESPN investigated these allegations.  He recently signed a new multi-year contract with the network.</p><p>And get this, there's a crypto currency exchange in Canada, and it might have lost $137 million U.S. dollars after its founder died, taking his business password to the grave with him.  Gerald Cotten who started QuadrigaCX was only 30 years old when he unexpectedly died.</p><p>This was late last year, from complications of Crohn's disease.  His widow says Cotten never shared the passwords before his death, so they can't find them right now.  I know.</p><p>Today is World Nutella Day on a much lighter, sweeter note, and to celebrate Nutella is giving away free personalized jars.  If you live in New York or Chicago, you can visit an official Nutella cafe to get a jar inscribed with your name, each cafe will give away 100 free jars of the chocolate hazelnut spread.</p><p>After that, you can buy them with the purchase of -- well, you can get them for free if you buy an item of the menu.  There is a Nutella cafe in Union Square, I believe, Maria, if you're interested.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nutella Day, all right, thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, the State of the Union is tonight.  We are taking a look at the State of the Union throughout the years.  We will look back at some of the most memorable moments from presidential speeches.  Stay with us, back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria Bartiromo, I want to point out before we move on, I'm going to be interrupting and be the rude person that I am.  But I want to congratulate you, you were on the cover of Resident Magazine.  The article is titled: Life at The Top with Maria Bartiromo, it's expensive article, the photographs of this gorgeous woman are beautiful and there's nobody I've ever worked with who works harder than you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And their article goes through that but you cover a lot of ground and I was reading, you were talking about where you were on 9/11 and covering that and being downtown and it is exceptionally moving.  So, I will tweet this, you tweet it.  I saw the cover because you put it on Instagram, but the photographs are really stunning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was grateful to talk to able to talk to them and be on the cover like that.  But you know what, I want to just say that I would never be able to have such an incredible program without you every morning.  There is nobody more informed, more well-read, knows every op-ed, every story in the news than you, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I mean it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm serious -- because I feel supported and I just feel like this is the smartest conversation on television.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every single day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And It could never be without you and without our incredible guests.  And by the way, I have an incredible support system of fantastic women around me not just onset with Dagen and Lindsey and Lee Carter and our other contributors, but also behind the scenes: Tammy, and Rachel and Gina and Courtney -- I'm not going to say everybody because I'm going to forget, but Tammy is such an incredible support and leader of this program.  And so, people don't know the women, the strong women that we have on MORNINGS WITH MARIA and I'm grateful and blessed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm blessed as well and great outfits.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, some of those were from Morocco.  So, they were my outfits that I -- I wanted to put my own outfit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could tell because you have incredible sense of style that is unique to you.  And I could tell -- and I could tell that you picked out --</p><p>WOLF:  I want to chime in.  I feel like the most powerful man in business this morning sitting in this panel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Well, good.</p><p>WOLF:  Especially between Dagen, Maria and Lindsey.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, you two are dynamic duo and everyone on the show; it's really great to be part of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  We are grateful for our viewers, that's for sure.  Because you're there every day and we appreciate and you make us smarter, so thank you to our viewers, thank you for that, Dagen.  So generous.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, the State of the Union is tonight.  Fox Business is having live coverage this evening but next, we're taking a look back at some of the most memorable moments from past presidential speeches.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  States like these and their terrorist allies, constitute in access of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction.  These regimes pose a grave and growing danger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deja vu.  That was President George W. Bush's 2002 State of the Union address where he coined the iconic phrase the \"access of evil.\"  We're just hours away from President Trump's 2019 State of the Union tonight.  And joining us right now to talk about some of the most memorable State of the Union moments is Presidential Historian Doug Wead.  Doug, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Put the importance of the president or President Bush's access of evil comment in perspective in regards to that time in history as we look ahead to tonight?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, it was right after 9/11 so the country was very unified, but that's also the speech, Maria, with the famous 14 words saying that the British have learned Saddam Hussein tried to purchase uranium in Africa.  Which turned out to be not true.  We went to war; couldn't find weapons of mass destruction.  The world was dropped in second worst depression in history, and the Middle East has been in chaos.  So, sometimes, unity can be overrated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, unity can be -- that's interesting because we're still talking about the access of evil.  Another memorable State of the Union was 1942, speech by FDR one month after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Talk to us about this; the biggest take away of this historic one?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the great example here is what unity can do.  We lost 40 percent of our naval tonnage.  We came back, rebuilt it, built an air force, developed the atomic bomb, defeated Nazi Germany, defeated the Japanese imperial empire.  We did it all in 3 years.  You can't even build 10 miles of interstate highway in three years.  The Mueller probe has taken 2 years.  So, this shows you what America can do if it's united.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  President Lyndon Johnson would use the State of the Union in 1964 to declare war on poverty and unemployment.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNDON JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let the session of Congress be known as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this was called a watershed moment for the Johnson presidency, why?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the war on poverty.  I mean, who could be against that?  But today, it's controversial and debated both ways because we gave subsidized housing, we rewarded mothers based on the number of children they had, we gave them food stamps, we gave a bonus if they were single; it caused an epidemic of divorce in the ghettos.  Millions of young men were raised without a father and no one would want to go back to what happened.  Today, we have full unemployment among women, among African-Americans; among Hispanic, job and the American dream seems to be more powerful than just giving people money out of the concern and love for them.</p><p>WOLF:  Hey, Doug, this is Robert Wolf and I'm a big fan of history of presidents and State of the Unions.  You know, I have a question, you know, I never -- I will always remember when I was sitting with my boys when they were younger and we were watching the State of the Union and they saw half spin and half sit, and they said, I thought everyone respects a president clap.  I'm sure they said it a little differently there, probably like six and four at the time, or six and eight.  when did it become such a polarizing environment where not everyone would applaud great things and half would stand and half would sit?  I used to remember growing up, everyone would stand up and applaud.  When was the first time that you noticed that this was such political event for Congress?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the division began in George Washington's cabinet.  Jefferson, Hamilton and it's been ongoing.  There was a time in our history when we wouldn't even celebrate the fourth of July together, each political party had their own separate celebrations, so it's been bitter.  But America went through a time of unity with Barack Obama.  We unified under the idea that we had elected an African-American as president and coming out of that, we've returned to this division and bitterness, so it's more deeply felt and seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good way to put it.  Hey, how about President Ford calling for U.S. energy independence back in 1975?  In that address, he tried to break the U.S. addiction to foreign oil.  That was ahead of his time.</p><p>WEAD:  That was amazing.  And once again, it's amazing; we were looking for energy independence, today, we've got it.  So, so unity can be overrated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and the U.S. is the number one producer.  Doug, it's good to see you as always.  Thank you.</p><p>WEAD:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business will have live coverage of the president's State of the Union address tonight.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings are in focus this morning.  Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results.  Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today.  Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p>Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening.  Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p>This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact.  The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent.  And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq.  Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices.  FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent.  CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points.  Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight.  It is the lunar holiday.  Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year.  However, Japan is open.  And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig.  How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year.  We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight.  Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency.  It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today.  We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight.  It starts at 7:00 p.m.  And then at 8:00 p.m.  We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\".  Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight.  Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig.  We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.  Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years.  Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Oh is this to me?  Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.  It is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Viacom released mixed earnings this morning.

Three-quarters of one percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well.  The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.</p><p>Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year.  It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan.  It was down a fraction.</p><p>We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight.  The president's expected to call for unity in tonight's address.  After the recent government shutdown over border wall funding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:  He's calling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, c-o-m-i-t-y and also compromise.</p><p>SEN.

It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern.  And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State.  I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.</p><p>Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl.  The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: February 5, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 020503cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast this morning.  Earnings in focus, Google parent Alphabet set to weigh on THE NASDAQ after last night's results.  The stock is down better than two percent right now on the heels of an increase in spending.</p><p>Investors are watching big media this morning.  Viacom reported a revenue miss earlier, that stock is under pressure as well and Disney is out tonight after the close.  That will be the focus after the close tonight.  Meanwhile, the markets are expected to open higher today.  Take a look, Dow Industrials up 85 points right now, a third of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 is up five points and the NASDAQ up a third of a percent, 21 points higher this morning on NASDAQ.</p><p>This after a strong day yesterday.

S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with an 83-point rally better than one percent higher on NASDAQ yesterday.  Global markets this morning, European indices higher across the board, FT-100 up 1-1/4 percent, DAX Index up better than one percent, CAC quarante up about one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, well, most markets are close for the Lunar New Year.  As you see Japan was open and it was lower.  Countdown to the State of the Union back in the U.S.  President Trump set to tout the economy tonight and call for unity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It is a challenge to all of us in this country when the President stands up and says let's work together on X, or Y or Z as he will tomorrow and I hope people will hear that call.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a preview of the State of the Union coming up this morning.  Plus this, breaking bread.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell had dinner with President Trump at the White House last night and it was Powell's birthday.  We'll tell you what was discussed as we know it.  Patriots on parade.  The team celebrating its Super Bowl victory in Boston this morning.  With all of the technology focused at Sunday night new concerns about artificial intelligence on the rise.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen's Dagen McDowell, 32 Advisors CEO, former economic advisor to President Obama --</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Patriots fans.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robert Wolf.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Yes, yes.  You Patriots won again.</p><p>WOLF:  I know.  I thought we were in a slump because it was like 65 days since we won the World Series.  You know, what a can I say, it's been tough few months.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are the kinds of things that annoy people.</p><p>WOLF:  It does and I'm OK because there are so many heirs out there for my path.  I'm all right -- I'm all right to brag, you know, I get a 48 hour --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're allowed.  They're winners.  That's fine.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  -- because now you're tied with the Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins.</p><p>WOLF:  That's true.</p><p>BELL:  We'll see what happens next year.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  I hope that Jay Powell got the most delicious chocolate cake for his birthday at the White House.  Although I think that's at Mar-a-Lago and not the White House.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  Just saying.  And Rich Clarida, the Vice Chair was there at the dinner as well along with Secretary Mnuchin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder if Jay Powell said to the President, you know what, Mr. President?  You were right.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were (INAUDIBLE) we were on auto pilot.  We were (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  You know he went with the talking points exactly what he said at the press conference last week and just read the bullet points to him and they say, how about those Patriots?</p><p>WOLF:  I think your cake had a big 25 on it because we broke to 25,000 again and invite him next month when we pay 26,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  But look, it is a serious and important story that the Federal Reserve gave us the pivot, right?  I mean, what are they saying, Dagen?  They may not even raise rates this year.  It's all about the data.  They might even change the balance sheet unwind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Keep an eye on the balance sheet and there was an interesting article that was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that tried to explain why the Federal Reserve did what they did in terms of this 180-degree turn and it was kind of curious because it says they're looking at the risks down the road, so they were trying not to frighten the market and frighten investors about that they see the economy in a steep -- in some sort of steep decline.  It was very curious.</p><p>The messaging has been to borrow Stephanie Pomboy's phrase.  Real keystone cops in the last couple of months.  But ultimately they did do what President Trump suggested.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They did actually.  Meanwhile, the State of the Union is tonight.  President Trump will tout his economic success.  He'll also call for unity amid another potential government shutdown.  Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the preview of it all.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  The White House says later tonight for the State of the Union Address, President Trump will lay out some of his biggest priorities for the upcoming year.  That includes completing new trade deals, lowering the cost of prescription drug prices and of course, discussing legal and safe immigration as the President sees it.</p><p>The White House says that the President will talk about building new coalitions and healing old wounds.  Kellyanne Conway saying this morning that the speech will be as she put uplifting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY:  The President is calling for unity, he's calling for an end to retribution and resistance politics and more cooperation and compromise.  He's proven this is possible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  But the speech delayed a week comes after the longest government shutdown ever, involving a stalemate over border wall funding.  It's also quite possible there could be another shutdown over this very same issue next weekend.  And the President is threatening to declare a national emergency at the southern border.  Chuck Schumer saying yesterday, that when the President describes the State of our Union as strong, later this evening, don't believe it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  President will say predictably that the State of our Union is strong but the truth is, the state of the Trump economy is failing America's middle class, the state of the Trump healthcare system is failing American families.  And the state of the Trump administration is embroiled in chaos and incompetence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  This is the third time, Maria, that President Trump will go to Capitol Hill and address Congress, the first time he did it the first few weeks after his administration technically joint address to Congress, so last year was technically the first State of the Union, this year the second one but a different dynamic.  A much different dynamic this time around as Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats will be sitting there right behind them.</p><p>So for this hour, hour and a half, we will get real-time reaction from the Democrat leader.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We can't wait to see her facial expressions, Blake.  We'll be watching closely.  We're going to be live tonight on Fox Business with that.  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  I want to bring in Pennsylvania Congressman and House Committee on Foreign Affairs member, Scott Perry.  For your reaction, Congressman, good to see you.  Tell us how you see tonight's big show.</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  Well, good morning, Maria and congratulations on the resident.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>PERRY:  I think it's going to be an uplifting speech.  I think the President is going to try.  Obviously, this resist issue with this President doesn't help any of us.  You can -- you can dislike the President personally, that's -- this is America, you can dislike lima beans, if you dislike them as well.  But the point is is that we don't have to work together for what's good for the country and see, you got to put some of those personal things aside.</p><p>Each of us do for the good of the country and with all due respect to Senator Schumer, I mean, talking about the economy, I mean, January is the best month in the market for a very long time, 300,000 -- plus 300,000 jobs produced in the last month.  And, finally, wage is coming up.  This tax reform that this President has shepherded through and seeing real effects for real Americans, from the top to the very bottom.  And I think you have to acknowledge that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  We just came off of the best month of January in 30 years and we do have some very strong economic numbers as the backdrop but, you know, the fighting words now are coming out through guests this evening, the White House invited 11-year-old Joshua Trump.  He's been bullied because of his last name and they're not related.  Alice Johnson whose prison sentence was commuted last year after lobbying from Kim Kardashian also on the guest list.</p><p>Democrats are inviting furloughed Federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump Golf Clubs.  Your thoughts on this aisle divide.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, , listen once again I think you got to put away your discord for whatever side, you're -- you know, if you have discord with other side no matter what side you're on.  We have to be looking to do what's best for our country, what's best for our neighborhoods.  And I guess making the political point but got to be respectful of the presidency and got to a standard of decorum in this country that has been whining overtime.  All of us have to do a little better with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so right.</p><p>PERRY:  And again, you know, working for -- doing the things we said we're going to do and working for what's best for the country even if it helps the other party a little bit, that's OK as long as it's good for the country.  Each one of us have that -- have that duty, have that responsibility.</p><p>WOLF:  Congressman, I love those words, I hope they go viral.  This is a Democrat saying that to you.  So, thank you.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I appreciate it.</p><p>WOLF:  One question I have here, I think it's on everyone's mind.  We all hate a shutdown, OK?  Left, right, center hates a government --</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  Nancy Pelosi loved it.</p><p>WOLF:  We all hate a shutdown.  So my question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>WOLF:  My question I have for you is, if there is literally no border -- no border money at the $5.7 billion, where do you think this goes and would you be supportive of the President using a national emergency for his border money?</p><p>PERRY:  Obviously I would prefer A, no shutdown and B, no national emergency having to be declared.  This is something that both -- this is a bipartisan issue that in the past both Democrats and Republicans have supported.  And we're happy to talk about things at the points of entry but I think you have to acknowledge in the -- in the month of November alone, 51,000 people apprehended between the points of entry --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not going to let you off the hook.  My question is if there is the possibility of a shutdown, would you support the government staying open and thus therefore, would you support the President allowing him to have national emergency literally going forward for His border money?</p><p>PERRY:  We should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.  So, yes, I'm going to support the border -- the government staying open and if the President is left to that only option to secure our border, then I'm going to have to support the President.  And I have to acknowledge that there's a problem at the border and we have to fix it, whether Democrat, Republican got to work together, understand that there are problems between the points of entry and there are problems at the point of entry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  We should be able to work on both of those things.  All of those things at the same time and acknowledge that regardless of who the President is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of a deal are you going to support with China?  We're less than a month away from this March 1st deadline.  The country remains under pressure because if the -- of I.P. theft, and I wonder if the President is going to allow China to get away with just buying more stuff rather than putting an end to the I.P. theft.  Kansas Senator Jerry Moran joined me along with the former COO of Microsoft, Bob Herbold on this very issue this week.</p><p>Here is what they had to say.  Got to get your reaction.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The theft that Chinese companies do of foreign businesses like American technology cost Microsoft $10 billion a year in profits.  I mean, how -- is that a fair -- is that a fair number?</p><p>BOB HERBOLD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE HERBOLD GROUP:  It is a fair number and the reason why these companies love being in China including Microsoft is that it's a huge population that has developed quickly in terms of middle-income Households.  So, it's like growing, you know, two new United States from a consumer standpoint.  This is a trade and if we make the mistake of simply talking about soybeans in regard to this trade pact that's coming.  We 'e making a huge mistake because the trust issue --</p><p>SEN. HERRY MORAN (R), KANSAS:  In a -- in a terribly dramatic way it's damaging to United States and the rest of the world, they do not play by the rules, they enforce technology transfers, steal our intellectual property, this is something that the President is right to take on, China is among our greatest competitors and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you wouldn't be -- you wouldn't accept a deal that only includes more stuff being bought by China then?</p><p>MORAN:  I think that would be mistake in the sense we would have gone through a lot of pain and not really resolved the overall issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, Congressman, some people think it's too late, it doesn't matter if China stops stealing I.P. tomorrow, they're already ahead of us in A.I.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I think they have plenty and if it -- they would be smart to stop but I would love to see a policy where we actually keep the dialogue open but treat China like China treats us.  So for instance, don't allow them to own any have any ownership in American companies as long as they don't allow us any ownership in their companies.  Don't allow the exchange of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- right now they can own 100 percent of a company in America.  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, we got -- but we got to look at changing, we have to look at changing the rules when you have a malign actor who continues to malign.  It's great to keep the conversation open but we have to protect America and China is not interested in America's interest, they're interested in China's interest.  So, easily, I think it's easy to explain to the American people.  Well, let's just treat China the way China treats us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Such a big story.  Congressman, thanks for weighing in on it.  Scott Perry joining us there.</p><p>PERRY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you here.  Be sure to tune in tonight business - Fox Business will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union Address.  We kick off at 7:00 p.m. and then MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. with the highlights of the speech.</p><p>I will be sitting down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.  This China story is so big.  I don't know if the people understand how enormous it is in terms of the theft.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I think we've made it too much about the tariff.  I think you've been so spot-on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  You've been speaking about the intellectual property for years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A long time.</p><p>WOLF:  And I think it's -- you know, no one's been able to put a hard line in the sand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are watching earnings this morning obviously, Viacom and Estee Lauder, both reporting this morning.  Disney, Snap reporting later today.  We're breaking down everything you need to know.  And then tech takeover.  Artificial Intelligence dominates the attention during Sunday night's Super Bowl Championship. We'll show you all about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are incredible pictures.  This is breaking news right now.  This happened moments ago.  Mexican police have beefed up their presence at the southern border.  They are in riot gear awaiting the arrival of the migrant caravan.  We're monitoring the situation and bring you updates because this is one of the criticisms that President Trump has had saying Mexico is not helping us enough.</p><p>And now you see that the Mexican police are in riot gear.  This new caravan is headed to the southern border and they will be met by this lineup of Mexican police in Piedras Negras, Mexico.  They're lined up at the border.  This is pretty incredible pictures right here.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  It also speaks to our healthy relationship with Mexico quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With ne new President, right?</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  The new President with our current President with the trade deal which is done with Canada and Mexico and how we're working in coordination with the Mexican authorities to prevent people from streaming illegally into this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This is the southern border and these pictures have just come in, so this is breaking -- this is a live picture right here.  We are looking at this live picture as it's happening right now because it's compelling given the fact they are in riot gear.  I guess the caravan is expected sooner.  I mean, I didn't know it was minutes away or within the hour that it's expected to get to the southern border.</p><p>But the migrants have been very clear, we want into the United States.  I mean, they told Griff Jenkins we're going to sneak in.  One guy -- one migrant that he spoke to said no, no, we are going to sneak in, we are on our way and we are going.  So clearly, the Mexican police are responding to this as they have lined up at the U.S.-Mexican border.  So we've got this on watch and as this story develops we will come back here and bring you the live pictures of what's happening at the southern border this morning.</p><p>Mexican police in riot gear lined up at border waiting for that caravan to arrive and it is close.  Meanwhile, we're watching earnings this morning.  Viacom shares are under pressure.  The company reporting mixed earnings.  Kristina Partsinevelos is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at the market that's about to open higher this morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, yes.  So it has opened higher but you have a company Viacom that released their earnings, revenue came in a little bit lower than expected at $3.1 billion.  You're seeing on your screen right now, it's climbing higher.  The earnings per shares adjusted also came in better than expected.  So that's why you're getting that mixed report.</p><p>You're seeing on your screen right now, it's climbing higher, the earnings per share adjusted also came in better than expected so that's why you're getting that mixed report.  The reason being though, was trading lower, now it's up a little bit higher, you had lower ad sales.  And that is a very, very similar story to what we heard yesterday from Alphabet, the parent company of Google.  Google reported their earnings and I'm still saying Google, you had earnings per share come in at $12.77.</p><p>So stronger than expected profit.  The problem though is the stock fell after tradings because of lower ad sales.  And the big concern is that you have Facebook and Google that take two-thirds of the market and Amazon is slowly starting to jump in.  And then last but not least, four earnings today, we have Disney, expectations for Disney is earnings per share to come in at $1.55.  You can see revenue at $15.1 billion.</p><p>A big, big question amongst a lot of analyst though is the streaming platform and how much revenue will be forgone to give towards the streaming platform.  I'm going to throw back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Kristina, thanks so much.  We will be watching that.  And of course, Disney after the bell is going to possibly be market mover, so we'll focus on that later.  Coming up next.  A.I. at the Super Bowl.  How Artificial Intelligence dominated Sunday night's big games.  Wait until you see the commercials.  Not sure if you recognize that.  Then, the power of Alexandria ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>The freshman Congresswoman generating such a powerful following on Twitter that some are comparing her influence to that of President Trump's RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel weighs in coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Motors turning to lay off thousands of white collar workers.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, after about 2000 employees took buyouts and another 1500 were let go, G.M. starts laying off roughly 4300 employees worldwide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOP KRISHER, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER:  Most of them will be in Detroit area, there's -- they're worldwide but G.M. of course has a concentration of white collar workers in the Detroit area mainly at the tech center in Warren.  That employs about 20,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  As many workers are handed pink slips.  The company introduces its new Silverado heavy-duty truck today.  It's a nice truck but it's coming amid some unfortunate news for the workers.  Shares are down a third of one percent in the premarket.</p><p>Lindsey Vonn crashing in the final super G-event of her career at the world championships in Sweden.  Emergency workers helped Vonn get back on her feet after she lost control and skid right through a gate hitting a safety fence.  She was able to ski down the rest of the course by herself as the crowd cheered her on.  Vaughn is an Olympic champion and a world champion.  She said last week she would retire after the world championship due to a series of injuries.</p><p>She is due to race one final time on Sunday.  And in just a few hours from now, Patriots' fans will celebrate their team's 6th Super Bowl win.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown where more than a million fans are expected.  Meanwhile, ratings for the Super Bowl, they hit an 11-year low.  CBS says total viewership hit 100.7 million views, that was about three million fewer than last year.</p><p>Live streaming, that was up 7-1/2 million devices streamed to the big game.  That actually set a new record but as viewership does decline so does ad revenues.  Super Bowl advertising sales fell more than six percent, CBS pulled in $382 million in ad sales during the game.  That was down from 408 million last year.</p><p>And speaking of commercials, you might have noticed there were a lot of robots instead of actors this year.  It's actually a creative trend that many say point to the anxiety of a future where robots replace humans in the workforce.  And Maria, you spoke about this with the former COO of Microsoft Bob Herbold as well as the chairman of Sinovation Ventures, Kai-Fu Lee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERBOLD:  It's the standard kind of jobs that require minimal kinds of training and skills that can be picked up by technology and integrated so that they're being carried out without humans.</p><p>KAI-FU LEE, CHAIRMAN, SINOVATION VENTURES:  A lot of jobs are going to change.  Almost all the jobs will change.  A.I. is not human intelligence, it's not magic, it's just a tool that can in one domain take a lot of data and make very smart decisions better than people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Advertisers are trying to ease some of the anxiety.  And you'll notice that the robots in the Super Bowl, they were always friendly, they were personal and they didn't always get it right.  So arguing that human is better to ease some of our concerns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't be compassionate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got that going for us.  We're funny.  Thank you, Lauren.  State of the Union tonight.  The Commander-in-Chief expected to a deliver a message of unity to the American people tonight amid the nation's heated debate over border security where Mexican police are lined up in riot gear right now.  We'll be speaking with RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings week in high gear, Estee Lauder and Ralph Lauren shares jumping this morning on better-than-expected earnings.  Take a look, Estee Lauder up almost 10 percent right now, Polo Ralph Lauren up almost seven percent.  Viacom had been lower.  It has turned higher, it was a mixed report.  We're breaking down all the earnings news this morning, and that is certainly moving markets.</p><p>Futures, meanwhile, expected to be up strongly up another 100 points at the start of trading, about a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is up five points right now, and the NASDAQ up 20 points also one-third of a percent higher on NASDAQ.  In Europe, the markets are also higher across the board, FT-100 up 1-1/3 percent, 93 points higher.  CAC Quarante in Paris up better than one percent as is the DAX Index in Germany, up 120 points there.  Asian markets mostly closed overnight for the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New Year.  Japan was down, however.</p><p>Countdown to the State of the Union back in the U.S., the President is calling for unity.  He will say that tonight while he threatens to call for a national emergency to fund the border wall.  The two sides digging in.  A Mexican police meanwhile are beefing up their presence at the border this morning.  These pictures just in, this is just happening right now.  These police are in riot gear.  They are waiting the arrival of the migrant caravan, which should get to the border shortly.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, breaking bread, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell having dinner with President Trump last night at the White House on Jay Powell's birthday.  Saddle up, I'm talking to the owner of a horse named, you guessed it, Maria Bartiromo.  Hey, don't bet against Maria Bartiromo.  We're going to take a look at that horse this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union, after a one week delay, President Trump is preparing to give his State of the Union Address tonight.  He is expected to call for optimism and unity as another potential government shutdown looms.  Joining me right now is RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us, Ronna.</p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what's your take?  How is the President going to say, yes, we want unity and everything is great, the economy is doing well when we know we just came off of a government shutdown, 35 days the government was a closed.  And the two sides are digging in, there's resist, resist, resist in the President's face all of the time.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, you're continuing to see the President put forward bipartisan compromise to Democrats, putting DACA on the table.  Democrats said if the government opens, we'll work with you on good faith to find a compromise.  We know there's an immigration crisis, the President did that.  So, he's going to continue to keep that theme, and he's saying \"choosing greatness\" we need to put aside our political differences.  The American people want to see us work together to solve real problems that are facing every American.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what's the plan to push back on this resist, Ronna?  I mean, are you going to have two years of nothing getting done because everything the Republicans want to try to get accomplished is met with resistance, everything the President says is met with resistance?  Do you have a plan to battle this?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, a lot of that is in the Democrats' hands.  And we've seen this since President Trump was elected with the amount of Democrats that boycotted the inauguration.  You're seeing Democrats boycotting the State of the Union tonight.  This is really where their party has gone, resist and obstruct.  Reject the results of the 2016 election because we didn't like what happened.  That's a bad precedent for our country.  We need to recognize the American people elected President Trump, and we need to do our best to help him be successful, and support our President.</p><p>The Democrats aren't doing that.  So, from the Republican's side of things, we're going to continue offering the olive branch.  We're going to say, come work with us, and I think the American people will decide, Republicans are getting things done, we're getting results, Democrats are continuing to double down on resistance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could -- I could count at least three or four Democrats who have already said, I'm not going.  They said, we don't want to be there.  So, they've already said they're not coming.  And then, there's another movement to wear white in the face of another sort of way that they're going to push back on the President.  Then, you've got all these special guests to be at the State of the Union tonight.  The President has the 11-year-old boy named Joshua Trump coming.  He's been bullied at school because of his last name.  They're not even related.  The Democrats are bringing furloughed federal workers, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.  What about this, the undocumented people working at Trump golf clubs?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the Democrats especially with the furloughed workers.  I mean, they should say to those furloughed workers.  Hey, guess what, the government is open because of the President.  If we had our way, it would still be shut cause we're not going to compromise.  So, I think it's ironic that they're bringing furloughed workers.  Listen, the President's guest exemplify the results of this administration.</p><p>Matthew Charles, the first inmate let go, because of the First Step Act, reducing prison sentences for nonviolent crimes, letting people get back into society, what a great story.  He has Alice Johnson, you have people from the Tree of Life Synagogue.  You have a couple -- a family of a couple who was killed in Nevada last month by an illegal immigrant.  So, the President's highlighting issue after issue and saying to Democrats we need to focus on policies that are going to help the American people, not partisan petty politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  They are choosing pettiness, the President is choosing greatness, and he is inviting them along with him.  Let's do great things for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good points.  What about this fight that went on on Twitter?  I mean, New York Freshman Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she's bringing the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake.  You remember this?  That was over his vote on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.  She's been a real star for Democrats.  She's got nearly 3 million followers on Twitter, more than Nancy Pelosi, more than Chuck Schumer.  Some are comparing her influence to President Trump's.  So, what about the power of AOC, do you think she is the face of this party?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, she is certainly very powerful in the Democrat Party.  And you're seeing her party move further and further left.  Listen, AOC is a socialist.  She is proposing government takeover of our education, of our health care.  We're looking at Venezuela right now and the disaster that is, and she's just trying to take us step-by-step closer to a socialist nation.  It is frightening what she's proposing.  She has no backup as to how she would pay for those things except for taxing people at a 70 percent tax rate.  That would be devastating to our country and our economy.  But all the 2020 candidates are lobbying her because they're going to need her base and her enthusiasm to win, which is just going to show how out of step the Democrat Party is becoming from mainstream America that recognizes the greatness of our country, of Democracy, of capitalism, and the ability to achieve the American Dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know what's amazing, I mean, it's like we're speaking different languages because that's not the way Chuck Schumer sees it.  You heard the sound bites earlier and Schumer -- Senator Schumer and Senator Sanders, Bernie Sanders, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times today, maybe you saw it, in support of limiting corporate stock buybacks.  Democratic Presidential contenders for 2020 are also supporting this idea.  They want to ban stock buybacks.  Is this going to be an issue for the presidential campaign, and what does this say about big government?  They're telling companies how to allocate their capital now.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  If they could, they would regulate everything.  And what they refuse to acknowledge, Maria, is jobs are coming back to this country.  We saw 304,000 jobs last month, you have wages up over three percent, growing over three percent.  The first time in a decade that you've seen that happen.  You have 4 million people now off of food stamps under the Trump administration.  Things are going great in this country, because of a couple things, deregulation, getting the government out of business, and the tax cuts, making our corporate tax cuts -- corporate tax rates competitive, and giving people more money to invest in our economy.  It is working, and Democrats can't even acknowledge that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick, Ronna, what would be victory --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDANIEL:  -- is the answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What would be victory tonight for the President?  What does he need to do to come away from this strong?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the President is talking to the American people.  And they're going to see this is a President who's putting forward reasonable, sound solutions, and Democrats continue to reject it.  I don't have hope that the Democrats are going to come across the aisle and work with this President because they haven't since day one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, national emergency.  You think he'll declare national emergency then for the border?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  I don't know.  I think the President is doing the right thing, trying to take every possible step to work with Congress.  But listen, we do have a crisis at our border.  You just showed pictures of this caravan about to come across.  We know 90 percent of the heroin is coming across our southern border.  300 deaths from heroin a week.  Human trafficking is an issue.  We just saw the MS-13 shooting last night in New York City.  This is a problem that we need to address, 2,000 people are trying to cross our border illegally.  Every single day, it's only getting worse, and it's been three decades of getting nothing done in Washington.  And this is a President that doesn't settle and say OK, let's just get nothing done.  He's here to get things done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a very scary sight what we're looking at right now, Ronna, you're right.  These are live pictures from Negras, Mexico, where the Mexico police are in riot gear.  They are lined up at the border waiting for this caravan to come.  So, it looks like Mexico is assisting the United States at this point in this.</p><p>And you mentioned the MS-13 shooting, that's on the cover of the New York Post today, MS-13 on the train.  That was the southern train broad daylight shooting, and it was a gang fight.  Really scary stuff, Ronna, and this is -- this is the post this morning, by the way, everybody.  Ronna Romney McDaniel, thank you so much for weighing in this morning.  We will see you soon.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Be sure to stay with Fox Business tonight.  We've got live coverage of the President's State of the Union Address.  It kicks off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, and then MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning in Washington, D.C.  Join me for the highlights from the speech.  I'll also be sitting down with a \"FIRST ON FOX EXCLUSIVE\" with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  That's tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. Eastern right here.  Join us for that special interview.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Alphabet reporting earnings last night after the bell.  The stock is down two percent.  It is off of the lows despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.  And then, focus on the Fed, what is in store for the Central Bank following Fed Chief Jay Powell's dinner last night with President Trump.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Alphabet reporting fourth-quarter earnings last night, slowing revenue growth, shrinking margins concerning investors.  Stock is down.  Joining me right now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It wasn't that bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  It just wasn't that bad.  I'm not buying this.  What is the stock down about $24.00 -- down 22 bucks, about two percent down.  I'm not buying that.  I think that Alice is saying it's down because Google, Alphabet is spending money on hiring new people and data centers.  OK, I got that.  Are they ignoring the 2 billion monthly users on YouTube which has yet to be monetized.  They seem to be ignoring that.  I just don't get it, Maria.  I'm not going to say the analysts are wrong, the market is wrong, I just don't get this particular equation.  And if I was left to guess, I'd say that Google bounces back fairly quickly to not necessarily its old high which is 12 percent high than where it is now, but certainly bounces back from this downturn that it's going to take first thing this morning.  What do you think?  What do you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it was a big number in terms of what they're spending.  You know how they have all of these other businesses that they want to --</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that they want to diversify.  But 90 percent of the business is still, what, search and advertising, right?</p><p>VARNEY:  Isn't this what they're supposed to do?  I mean, aren't you supposed to plow back your profits in to expansion, new businesses, and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true, yes.  You would think analysts like that.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you would have thought.  But this time, no.  I'm sorry, I don't get it.  But I'm not nasty about analysts or that or expectations.  I just don't get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, I know you'll have more on it.  And plus, you're going to preview Disney.  That's after the close tonight.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.  Thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>But first, the economy under President Trump.  The President dining with Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell last night at the White House.  It was Powell's birthday.  Then saddle up, I'm speaking with the owner of one special horse named, you guessed it, Maria Bartiromo.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are less than an hour away from the opening bell this morning.  We are expecting a gain at the start of trading about 100 points.  Investors are watching earnings.  But what also is important is what President Trump will say at tonight's State of the Union Address.</p><p>Joining us right now is Wayne Wicker, he is Vantage Point Investment Advisors' Chief Investment Officer.  Wayne, it's good to see you this morning.  Does the State of the Union matter to investors?  What do you want to see in order to move markets tomorrow -- tonight?</p><p>WAYNE WICKER, CIO, VANTAGE POINT INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Maria, I think that this is the perfect time for President Trump to come out and talk to the nation.  He's really standing on solid footing economically.  You've seen jobless claims coming in really strong, you see these earnings are coming in well.  I think that investors are really going to be focused on a level of optimism going forward in his words this evening, to propel markets higher.</p><p>BELL:  Wayne, Lindsey Bell here.  What's your read on the meeting last night, the dinner last night between Jerome Powell and President Trump and Steve Mnuchin and Richard Clarida?  What do you think markets should take from that?  Do you think that, you know, the Fed still remains independent.  What's the underlying thing to read?</p><p>WICKER:  Well, Lindsey, I think that we saw the big pivot at the beginning of this year, when we moved away from auto escalation to more of a data dependency.  I think what we saw last night was a little bit more of the same thing, where the Fed is trying to be -- quite frankly, a little bit more benign in their approach, and I think the combination of what Fed Powell is talking about as well as some of these meetings that he had with the administration, solidified that in investors' minds these days.</p><p>BELL:  What are you pricing in for rate hikes this year?</p><p>WICKER:  Well, I would say that the market probably has it right, that you don't see any inflation right now, and it's modest growth in the United States, and really not that great a growth outside the United States.  So, the market is suggesting maybe one hike later on this year.  I don't disagree with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you would buy stocks here?</p><p>WICKER:  I would absolutely buy stocks in this market.  You've seen some really strong earnings growths for the first half of earnings reporting season here.  I see that despite the fact that we had this V-shaped recovery which history would say, you may have some retracement at some point in the next few months.  I think the longer-term outlook is very strong for equities today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Wayne, great to have you weigh in.  Thank you.</p><p>WICKER:  Uh-huh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wayne Wicker joining us there.  Up next, the owner of Maria Bartiromo, the horse.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a winning combination, champions are crowned at Rodeo Rapid City in South Dakota this past weekend.  One horse went 87 points for saddle bronc riding, and the name of that horse -- Maria Bartiromo.  Joining us right now by the telephone is the owner of Maria Bartiromo the horse, Matt Burch.  Matt, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>MATT BURCH, OWNER OF MARIA BARTIROMO THE HORSE (via telephone):  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you name your horse Maria Bartiromo?</p><p>BURCH:  Well, my dad is the one that started this.  We're big time Fox News watchers.  And he was sitting there one day and he normally writes horses' names down on paper that he wants us to name, me and my brother, and he told us that he wanted us to find one horse and wanted to name it after you because you're an intelligent person, very classy, so he told us to make sure we picked it on a good one, so that age of colts we start them at 5 years old.  And for about four or five trips, we could tell that this mare right here was the most talented, classy, intelligent one of the bunch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, Matt --</p><p>BURCH:  And obviously, you can see she's very pretty.  So, I think (INAUDIBLE) you know, big white mane on her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BURCH:  After about five trips, my brother said there's our horse.  So, we put your name on it and come to find out, she is our number one horse of that colt crop, and probably one of the best ones we're hauling down the road right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, Matt, did your daddy know that there was actually another horse, a racehorse that was also named after Maria Bartiromo at one point?</p><p>BURCH:  Well, I've seen that before, yes.  And I'm sure my dad did -- probably had seen that before, but you know, from the racehorse business to where we go is the (INAUDIBLE) horse deal, two totally different kind of horses.  So, my dad is a very intelligent man, I'm sure he probably knew that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love -- I am so honored and she performed how often, Maria Bartiromo?  Yes.</p><p>BURCH:  Oh, that mare, well, she'll go about 20 trips all-year long.  She goes to all of the biggest rodeos we go to.  She's been to Houston, Texas, Clovis, California, (INAUDIBLE) Idaho, San Antonio, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Rapid City, obviously.  Las Vegas, Nevada, to the (INAUDIBLE) NFR.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.  Listen, we're going to keep checking on her.  We so appreciate it.  And I appreciate it.  I'm so honored, Matt, thank you very much.  All the best to you and your father.</p><p>BURCH:  Well, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt Burch --</p><p>BURCH:  OK.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We got to get you to a Rodeo.  We got to go to the NFR in December.  That is rad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's do that.  All right.

Good morning to you.  Happy Tuesday, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Alphabet stock under pressure this morning, the parent company of Google, reporting strong fourth quarter results, but it was the expense side of the business, spending concerns dragging on the stock this morning.  We're taking a closer look at that.  Plus the other companies on tap including Disney today.  Earnings round-up coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking bread, Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, having dinner with President Trump at the White House last night on Jay Powell's birthday.  The details coming up right here.  Countdown to State of the Union, President Trump set to tout his economic success tonight.  We're taking a closer look at who will be attending as guests of the President and the Democrats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Patriots on parade.  The team celebrating its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning, following not-so super ratings for the big game.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets right now.  Take a look at futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow industrials right now up better than 70 points, a quarter of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 up 3-1/2, and the NASDAQ right now looking like it gained at the start of trading of about 11 points, this after the market started the week on a strong note.  Big cap technology and industrial stocks led big a rally yesterday, take a look, the Dow industrials up 175 points at the close yesterday, up three quarters of a percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18 and the NASDAQ, with all those tech names there, up better than one percent, 84 points higher at the close yesterday.</p><p>Earnings season rolling on this morning with Google parent company, Alphabet, reporting after the bell last night.  The numbers were better than expected last night, but the concerns are really over higher expenses and that's weighing on investors this morning.  Company is spending more money on a whole host of businesses away from search.  The stock down 2-1/2 right now this morning.  Viacom, Walt Disney, and Snap all reporting today.</p><p>And joining me right now is Wells Fargo Asset Management Senior Investment Strategist, Brian Jacobsen.  Brian, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here.  So characterize, assess for us the fourth-quarter earnings period so far from your standpoint.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Sure.  From our standpoint, it looks like the real story here isn't that it's a lot better than people expected, it's just that it could have been a lot worse.  I think that with the December drubbing that we had with the equity markets, a lot of it was around rising risks of recession.  But now those risks appear to be receding as we that about anywhere from 70 to 75 percent of companies that have reported have actually beat estimates depending upon, you know, which data provider you look at to get earnings estimates.</p><p>So, so far so good.  And our expectation is that we're going to continue to see this economic expansion continue.  And so we're continuing to favor more cyclical areas of the market, you know, the run-up with industrials and technology, to us isn't really all that surprising mainly because we thought that the market was overplaying the risks of recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, because the risk of recession seems to be -- the commentary is getting louder and louder.  But we know from a fundamental basis we saw earnings up better than 20 percent in 2018, 22 percent or something, and we're expecting earnings to be up, what, four percent, six percent.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  They're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that concern you that we're going to see such a slowdown and profitability?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Well, that doesn't happen all that often, but there is something somewhat unique about last year's numbers, is the fact that you did have tax cut, which probably contributed, you know, somewhere between anywhere from 10 to 11 percentage points to EPS growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  So part of it was a one-off with tax cuts.  But we don't think that now we're going to see a rolling over of earnings.  So, what I like to do when you do have these one-off effects like with tax cuts is really look at topline earnings growth as more of an indicator of the underlying strength of businesses, and there, that's still looking pretty healthy, about eight percent year-on-year expectations for the 12 months is something closer to around maybe fix to six percent, which is still pretty good, so it's nothing close to some people are talking about an earnings recession, where you have corporate profits falling, but the economy's still kind of trudging along.  We don't think we're going to see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  The Fed, that's certainly one of the big stories for this market, a real pivot at the end of last year where the Fed told us at the beginning of this year as well, \"Look, we are going to wait, we're going to -- it's going to be data-dependent, they may very well not raise at all this year and maybe we're even going to see them pullback on the balance sheet.  Fed Chairman Powell dined with the President last night.  Does that concern you?  I mean in terms of the Fed's independence given the President's stance on the Fed for so long now?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  It doesn't, and it's mainly because I think that the data justifies the pivot by the Fed.  One of our big concerns going into the last part of 2018 was that the Federal Reserve was going to hike because they could, not because they should.  There was, to us clear, evidence that the housing market had been suffering for a lot of 2018, that you had a lot of somewhat tightening of financial conditions and so I think that without the clear and present danger of inflation picking up, there's really no reason for the Fed to continue hiking as it was, so they're probably closer to being done than they are more towards the mid part of the game as far as with rate hikes.  So, it wasn't really too surprising that they made the pivot, but the markets sure did cheer that on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does the State of the Union matter to investors?  Is there anything that you would anticipate is said tonight at the State of the Union that could move markets tomorrow?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Well, I think that there are a few things that we could see, you know, if there's any sort of policy statement about, you know, let's say anything with drug pricing, or with -- the opioid epidemic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Good point, yes.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  But otherwise, I think that we're going to be really looking for any teasers about trade policy.  It seems like the talks have gone well so far and President Trump and President Xi are going to be meeting at the end of February so is he going to outline what some of those agreements are that they've come to?  But then otherwise, probably going to focus on immigration and the border wall, which, from an investor perspective, probably isn't as meaningful except if it leads to further government shutdowns in the context of a debt ceiling debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I think the most recent shutdown didn't really impact the markets much because it was partial, and also we weren't dealing with trying to raise the debt ceiling.  Future ones, we may not be so lucky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's great point.  And real quick before you go, Disney and Viacom, any thoughts on those earnings today?</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I don't have any really view on those --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  I don't cover those.  Those are up to our analysts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brian, it's great to see you.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Great to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACOBSEN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  Brian Jacobsen, great insights from you as always from Wells Fargo.  Meanwhile, the Patriots' victory parade is this morning.  You know it was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history.  Also generating the game's lowest T.V. ratings in a decade.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  What's your take here?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, lame commercials, Maroon, as this -- the half-time performers, and then a game about as interesting as watching your gran papi mow the lawn, that is why this Super Bowl was a ratings loser.  98.2 million people watched the Patriots beat the Rams, that is the smallest television audience since 2008 when the Giants beat the Patriots, we all remember that around New York City, that was a five percent drop in the ratings from last year, a 12 percent drop om ratings from the Super Bowl in 2017.  Now 2.6 million people did stream the game across digital platforms.  That is a digital record for viewership.  It pushed the total audience above that 100 million mark, but this game needed it because people watching on T.V., a lot of them didn't show up, particular Los Angeles.</p><p>The ratings were weak for the Rams and down in New Orleans, the folks down there, the Saints fans upset, about that blown call that if they had gotten it right would have sent the Saints to the Super Bowl.  That city had the lowest ratings for New Orleans in Super Bowl history.  However, this Super Bowl and the rating, the poor ratings, cap a year where ratings have come back for the sport.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Before Sunday's game, ratings were up nine percent during the playoffs, five percent during regular season.  It was people like Patrick Mahomes, people were --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- tuning in to watch him play, and Roger Goodell having a lower profile this past --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  That's what I was going to say, Dagen, because I feel like over the last several months, the hoopla and the upset of the kneeling issue and concussions sort of went down.  And I thought, \"Well, maybe this is, you know, viewed are coming back.\"  Not so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- well, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your numbers won't show it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were during the season, but again when you put up a game that was this awful to watch --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- where both -- neither offense really showed up.  You can argue that it was all about the defense, no, it was just boring and people, well, went and did other things like, I don't know, groom their cats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God, you're tough.  Thank you, Dagen.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  Meanwhile, President Trump is expected to announce some key nominations today.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The President is expected to nominate Treasury Department Official, David Malpass, to be next leader of the World Bank.  He is one of the World Bank's sharpest critics within the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.  Now the U.S. holds a controlling share of the bank's board voting power.  And the President plans to nominate Former Energy Lobbyist, David Bernhardt, as Secretary of the Interior.  Democrats and environmental groups have criticized that decision saying he is vulnerable to conflicts of interest.</p><p>President Trump's Inaugural Committee says it will comply with the subpoena from Federal Prosecutors.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the Feds requesting documents related to spending and donations as well as information about benefits donors received from making contributions including tickets and photo opportunities with the President.  Prosecutors also want documents related to donations made by foreign nationals.  The committee raised a record-breaking $107 million, that leading up to the 2017 inauguration.</p><p>Amazon has named another African American to its mainly white board.  Rosalind Brewer will become the second black female director for Amazon.  She is Starbucks' Chief Operating Officer.  The move comes as companies come under pressure to diversify their corporate boardrooms.  Shares of Amazon are lower just fractionally in premarket trading at 16.33 a share, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you.  Coming up, the State of the Union is tonight.  President Trump will deliver the speech after postponing it a week due to the shutdown.  The key issues he hopes to tackle, plus his special guests right after this.  And then crypto secret, nearly $200 million in cryptocurrency cannot be accessed because the only person with the password is no longer alive.  He passed away.  The stunning story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We got a big program this morning.  Coming up, California Congressman, House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, here in the studio.  Pennsylvania Congressman, and House Foreign Affairs Committee member, Scott Perry, here as well.  RNC Chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, joining me along with FOX News Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane, here.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>We are also counting down to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to address the country, highlighting some key issues that Americans face.  Plus touting his economic success so far under his leadership.  Joining the conversation this morning is 32 Advisors CEO, Former Economic Advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf here.  Along with CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, great to see you guys this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So what should the President tackle tonight, Robert?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I agree.  He should focus on the economy, which has been incredibly strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, he's going to have to go there on the combination of immigration, government shutdown, and talk about the deal he wants.  My guess is half will stand, half will sit down.  And I think he is going to have to talk about foreign policy because it seems like there's republicans that's starting not to basically agree with where he is on Syria.  So, I think it's going to be a very interesting, you know, State of the Union.  I know it's a week later than we were expecting, but I think it's always important to hear the President.</p><p>BELL:  I think the timing of this is really good, too.  After the government shutdown, this is a chance for President Trump to potentially regain some momentum, especially after the loss he incurred during that and really lay out the plan, like you said, with regards to immigration policy going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we are expecting a slowdown.  Is that largely because of the rest of the world, do you think?  Is it because this expansion is going on 10 years, or is it something domestically in the U.S.?  I mean I know housing has been a weak spot.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I mean I think of course the rest of the world is slowing down.  And when China and Europe are slowing down, that is going to have an impact on our economy.  But also we're cycling the sugar high of tax reform, fiscal policy, deregulation, so it's hard to comp on top of those numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.  Tough comparisons.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, it is.  We're -- we went off an incurably low base a decade ago, and now all of a sudden it's off a higher base and we're starting to see hourly earnings get better, wages get better, GDP get better, but the question is are we on the backend of that 10-year recovery, and it -- you know, listen, we have 50 percent of the economists saying so, but we have seen 50 percent of them be wrong many, many times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump needs to talk about his strategy to keep this economy going and maybe get out of the way of it because, again, some of the administration's policies have put a damper on American business, the steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place, and the exemptions weren't even getting processed during the government shutdown.  He needs to lay out a two-year agenda on how he's going to keep the economy growing at a three percent rate.</p><p>By the way last year three percent plus rate, even though we haven't gotten the final, final numbers for the year, but that's the fastest since 2005.  He has to continue that because voters have very short-term memories if he wants to get reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is he going to do that?  I mean are there --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- areas in terms of policy that there's common ground or are we going to see the next two years resist, resist, resist?  There are some Democrats who have already said, \"I'm not going.\"  Meaning he's over here.  The President is also expected to make a call for unity tonight.  Unity.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK?  Amid these massive divisions between the Republicans and the Democrats.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  The -- listen, the environment is more polarizing than it's ever been, you know.  Since the midterms, there's no question that the Democratic Party has had a shift to the left.  The biggest voices are more populist, whether it's Cortez or Priestley, or -- and there's a big push to the left.  On the flip side, those who won in the Republican Party definitely a much more of the more conservative far-right base, so we've lost the center and we -- it would be great for all of us if we got the center back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think about Howard Schultz?  Is he the answer?</p><p>WOLF:  You know, Howard Schultz, for me, is not the answer.  I mean I like some of his policies, and if -- I wish he ran as a Democrat.  I'm not one who's touring for an independent third party.  I don't think it's where the country is right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that he will take votes from the Dems?</p><p>WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I think his -- he literally aligns with the Democrats 95 percent of the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he does.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I think that's a real problem for the Democrats going forward into 2020 and I think that the polarization of the country really is going to get people out there and voting this time around, too, I think.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But shouldn't the Dems just recognize that?  If much of the country is in the center like you are leaning to the left or leaning to the right, why can't the Democrats understand that and not have the loudest people in the room, those who want Medicare-for-all, abolish ICE, 70 percent tax rates like AOC?</p><p>WOLF:  I think what's fascinating is if actually you looked at the midterms, the Democrats did best in the moderate areas.  And if you look at most recent polling, actually the Democratic Party wants over 50 percent actually shift to the center, but it doesn't really make a difference what polling says.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  The excitement and the electricity in the party is shifted to the left.  That's where -- that's why I've always said the likely candidate for the Democratic Party who could win a primary will have a tougher time in the national election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Good point.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's call -- let's talk about unity, though.  The Criminal Justice Reform, signed into law by President Trump, it had bipartisan support.  One of the guests at the State of the Union from the President tonight will be Matthew Charles, the first man released from prison under this.  I think that he's also going to have Alice Johnson there whose sentence was commuted by President Trump.  This is something that the Democrats should be cheering more loudly than they are right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But because it's President Trump they're not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- I think people are going to get frustrated with all of this constant resist.  I mean, are the women going to wear all white?</p><p>WOLF:  I don't know what they're wearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More games.  Why can't we just work together?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am most interested to watch the face of Nancy Pelosi --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Behind President Trump, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this entire State of the Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope she rehearses stoicism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So -- because, again, it's going to be --</p><p>BELL:  It's the sign of that resist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's going to be -- that's going to be the thing that we're all talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're going to watch it right here as FOX Business --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- is going to have live coverage of President Trump's State of the Union tonight.  It all kicks off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  The President will speak at 9:00 p.m. and we'll be watching both Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Pence behind the President and, of course, focused on the President's speech.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. with the highlights from the speech and a whole host of terrific guests.</p><p>I'll be sitting down with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, tomorrow, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for this exclusive tomorrow morning from Washington with the Secretary of State right here.  Coming up first, the war on terror, we're talking about it next.  The Pentagon is warning about the future of ISIS in Syria as the senate votes to keep troops there on the ground defying President Trump.  The debate coming up.  Then Hawaii may say aloha to smoking.  The interesting way the state wants to phase out the sale of cigarettes next up right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. .  Headlines across America this morning.  The Hawaii Tribune-Herald writing a Local Representative Richard Creagan is proposing a cigarette ban.  The bill is aimed at stopping the sale of cigarettes by increasing the minimum age to buy them --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to 100 years.  The age would be slowly increased over several years starting at 30 years old in 2020, 40 in 2021, and then 100 by 2024.  Over to the Chicago Tribune, it's reporting today is O'Hare is once again the nation's busiest airport in terms of total flights.  O'Hare International reclaimed the titled from Atlanta for the first time since 2014.  In total, there were over 900,000 thousand flights in and out of O'Hare just last year.  Finally from The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia is considering banning cashless stores.  Philly City Council will consider a bill today that would prevent stores from refusing to accept cash and prevent stores from charging people more if they pay with cash.</p><p>Interesting stories here in the headlines across America.  What do you think that's all about in Philly?  I mean I'm wondering if facial recognition is -- people are looking at it and giving it second thoughts.</p><p>WOLF:  I don't like the idea of cashless stores because I think people don't really use their credit cards that well, right?  And they don't realize they're paying 18, 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true, yes.</p><p>WOLF:  So I think actually, you know, everyone thinks it's for free until they start getting their invoices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't know how much you're spending.</p><p>WOLF:  So, I'm a little nervous about that.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, but I feel like it's the way that technology is taking us.  I mean you have on your iPhone Apple Pay and all these things, people are using Venmo more and more often.  I just feel like it's the way the world --</p><p>WOLF:  But people -- but the other side is you're giving more of your information when people want to start going the other way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  That's fair.  That's fair.</p><p>WOLF:  I mean -- I mean the whole privacy thing -- great, we're going to have 10 more apps on our phone that has everything we do every step of the way.  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are some small businesses that don't want to accept cash.  All you need is a Square account and the Square app and you just a do swipe.  You even use your -- even use your mobile device --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to ring up customers.  So why force small business owners to accept cash?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People have the right to not shop there.  It's not a -- it -- we're not talking about supermarkets and drugstores, I doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  By the way, you mentioned, you know, the data, that's why China is number one in A.I. because of all of the data that it has collected about people.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I mean we were talking offset.  I think one of the most important things that the President's going to say tonight is where he is with China.  What's important is the tariff and trade, where is it with intellectual property.  On the flip side, he knows he wants to put an olive branch out there because March 1st is kind of the deadline before tariffs go up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  So he's got to figure out how he wants to thread the needle between hitting them publicly, but also not hitting them too hard during the negotiation.  It will be interesting what he does, but obviously intellectual property is the big elephant in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.</p><p>WOLF:  It's not about steel and trade and tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get into this because if they do a deal that just allows China to buy more stuff -- yesterday, China said that it is poised to buy more soybean and grain, and then leave I.P. and the forced transfer if technology on the cutting room floor, big trouble.  Big -- that is a big issue and we'll talk about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm still asking the question why are the steel and aluminum tariffs still in place if you've gotten the deal with Mexico and Canada and you're on the road to doing something about China, why are they still there.  And stop talking about them as a revenue generator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me just say, because I've asked this question of the administration and they will say if we don't have steel and aluminum tariffs all over, China will find the opening, and they will push through steel through Canada or somewhere else, that's what the administration will say.  We had to do it everywhere including our friends because otherwise there will be open pockets where China will push their product.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're wildly overselling that threat.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I would respectfully --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wildly overselling that threat.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I would respectfully disagree.</p><p>BELL:  And it's -- and it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  Make sure I'm being respectful.  Respectful disagree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's the putting the screws to American manufacturers and costing people jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big impact.  Big impact.  All right.  Quick break, and then staying in Iraq, that is the question.  President Trump outlines the plan to keep eye on Iran from Iraq, but politicians there are pushing back.  We've got the details coming up.  And then it's World Nutella Day, yes, it is.  How you can score some free jars with your name on it, this and more right after this, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning, welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 5th, your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Big names reporting earnings today, Viacom will be out in about half an hour, investors are also keeping an eye on Disney and Snap, reporting later today.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are looking to extend a winning streak this morning, Futures indicating another start that is strong this morning, Dow industrials up better than 90 points right now, about a third of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 is up s6, a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ up 18.</p><p>Even though we are seeing some weakness in companies like Alphabet, after its earnings last night, the major indices finished at the highest close in two months yesterday.  Take a look at yesterday's close, with the Dow Industrials picked up 175 points, 3 quarters of 1 percent, the S&amp;P 500 was up 18, that was two-thirds of a percent, and the NASDAQ with 83-point rally yesterday, up better than 1 percent.</p><p>I mentioned Alphabet, it is down, even though the numbers were better-than-expected, the company is seeing higher expenses, we'll talk about it coming up.</p><p>European indices this morning, look like this, and they are higher across the board, FT 100 up 1-1/2 percent right now, 106 points higher in London, CAC Quarante in Paris is up better than 1 percent, 54 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 142 points, one and a quarter percent higher this morning, big winners in Europe, today.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the indices are, well, largely closed for the lunar holiday, it is the Chinese New Year.  Japan was down by just a fraction.</p><p>We are on the countdown to tonight's State of the Union Address, with the guest list expanding on all sides.  President Trump is expected to call for unity in tonight's address.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Most importantly, in the State of the Union, the President is calling for an end to, sort of, resistance in retribution politics and calling for cooperation and compromise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  FOX Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight.

MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning in Washington with special guests.</p><p>I will be speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning, join us for that special interview, as we take a look at the President's foreign policy with the Secretary of State tomorrow, live from Washington.</p><p>Plus this, crypto mistake, Canada's largest exchange locked out of more than $130 million worth of crypto currency, because the only person who can access it has died.  He's the only person that had the password, we will tell you about that.  Then, spreading joy, it is World Nutella Day, and we will tell you how you can score your own Nutella, free jar with your name on it, all coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, troop withdrawal backlash, the Senate has voted to oppose President Trump's troop withdrawal in Syria and Afghanistan.  And the measure says that ISIS is still posing a serious threat.  And if the U.S. leaves, it opens the door for Russia and Iran to gain power in the region.</p><p>Joining me right now is Retired Four-Star General and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane, General, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I assume you were pleased with the Senate action yesterday, defying the President, but at the same time, putting out the case that maybe it's too soon to leave, what's your take?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, certainly, they're expressing concern over this withdrawal decision.  The President himself has tried to condition this withdrawal based on making certain that ISIS is truly defeated and does not re-emerge to protect the Kurds and three, to contain the Iranian land bridge that's in Southern Syria, and all of them had the oil fields.</p><p>Those conditions frankly, I think, would meet most of the senators' concerns, if they're actually executed.  I think they're reacting to the initial decision that the President made.  And the Pentagon's I.G. report came out just recently, saying that ISIS has the capability to re-emerge in 6 to 12 months, after the territory has been taken away from them, if we don't keep up the pressure on them.</p><p>And, Maria, the best way to keep the pressure on ISIS in Eastern Syria is to make certain that we control the air space, that we -- that's the British, United States and France doing that, and we have to have some people on the ground to facilitate the use of air power, not all of the 2,200 we have now, but the military (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And we do that, we can truly keep the pressure on ISIS and prevent from re-emerging, because we've got 60,000 local Syrian fighters who are on the ground against ISIS.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, I know that ISIS has certainly become a lot weaker in the last two years, but assess the situation of what could happen if the U.S. does, in fact, withdraw completely from Syria and Afghanistan, is the big worry that Iran moves in?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Iran will likely take over the oil fields in Eastern Syria with 70 percent of the oil in Syria.  You have to repair some of them because they've been damaged by conflict.  They will use that to finance the war in Syria which they are doing right now out of their own treasury.</p><p>And, of course, the President is slapping sanctions on them that are truly having some impact.  It would also open up a land bridge all the way through Syria for them that they've been wanting for years.  They fly a lot of their weapons into Damascus airport that they use in Lebanon, and they want to put small little bases in Syria to encroach on Israel's security.</p><p>So, containing Iran is certainly not letting them Syria as a strategic anchor, not letting them encroach on Israel's security.  And I think we can do that without a considerable amount of troops involved in that process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to Iraq, because the U.S. now could be looking to stay in Iraq.  Listen to what the President said in an interview on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  One of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran, because Iran is a real problem.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN, MODERATOR OF FACE THE NATION, CBS NEWS:  Whoa, that's news, you're keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran?</p><p>TRUMP:  No, because I want to be able to watch Iran, all I want to do is be able to watch.  We have an unbelievable and expensive military base spilt in Iraq.  It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, General?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, we are also -- we are already doing that clandestinely.  And the reality is, Iran is the malign actor in the Middle East.  Their presence in Iraq is somewhat formidable.  They've built Shiite militia brigades by the tens of thousands on them and train them, certainly, that would supposedly to take ISIS down, but it gives them leverage over the Iraqi government.</p><p>They put money in the pockets of Iraqi government leaders and every single opportunity they try to undermine the United States' position in Iraq and then the Middle East where at large.  Certainly, that air base that we have there also it's where our counterterrorism guys operate that's well known.</p><p>Clearly, it's a place that's a treasure for us in terms of resources and capability.  I think the President's issue is, could they impact, use that base to impact on things in Syria, the answer to that, of course, is yes, we could operate out of that and conduct some operations in Syria.</p><p>But I think it's the daily presence assisting the local fighters and making certain that we can still deliver air power, as I mentioned before, is going to be decisive in making certain that ISIS does not re-emerge and Iran does not take over Eastern Syria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, General, before you go, your reaction to this administration's stance on Venezuela?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think they are right on the mark.  The President has made up his mind to facilitate a regime change, to do that peacefully.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  -- and certainly, to support the new government that announced itself in President Guaido, and do everything that we can to put additional pressure on the Maduro regime and also to assist in moving the military leaders who are in the pocket of the regime, away from that regime.  That is the decisive move that's taken place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, joining us.  All discussions, topics for tomorrow, FOX Business will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, all the way until 11:00.</p><p>We will also be live tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live from Washington, with highlights of the speech, and I'll be sitting down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that special exclusive interview tomorrow morning with the Secretary of State.</p><p>First, though, this, ESPN fires an anchor over leaks to the media, Lauren Simonetti with the details, Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, Maria, ESPN's rising star, Adnan Virk, has been fired by that network.  He's accused of leaking confidential company information to the media about the network's baseball coverage.</p><p>Reports say that Virk also is uncooperative when ESPN investigated these allegations.  He recently signed a new multi-year contract with the network.</p><p>And get this, there's a crypto currency exchange in Canada, and it might have lost $137 million U.S. dollars after its founder died, taking his business password to the grave with him.  Gerald Cotten who started QuadrigaCX was only 30 years old when he unexpectedly died.</p><p>This was late last year, from complications of Crohn's disease.  His widow says Cotten never shared the passwords before his death, so they can't find them right now.  I know.</p><p>Today is World Nutella Day on a much lighter, sweeter note, and to celebrate Nutella is giving away free personalized jars.  If you live in New York or Chicago, you can visit an official Nutella cafe to get a jar inscribed with your name, each cafe will give away 100 free jars of the chocolate hazelnut spread.</p><p>After that, you can buy them with the purchase of -- well, you can get them for free if you buy an item of the menu.  There is a Nutella cafe in Union Square, I believe, Maria, if you're interested.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nutella Day, all right, thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, the State of the Union is tonight.  We are taking a look at the State of the Union throughout the years.  We will look back at some of the most memorable moments from presidential speeches.  Stay with us, back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria Bartiromo, I want to point out before we move on, I'm going to be interrupting and be the rude person that I am.  But I want to congratulate you, you were on the cover of Resident Magazine.  The article is titled: Life at The Top with Maria Bartiromo, it's expensive article, the photographs of this gorgeous woman are beautiful and there's nobody I've ever worked with who works harder than you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And their article goes through that but you cover a lot of ground and I was reading, you were talking about where you were on 9/11 and covering that and being downtown and it is exceptionally moving.  So, I will tweet this, you tweet it.  I saw the cover because you put it on Instagram, but the photographs are really stunning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was grateful to talk to able to talk to them and be on the cover like that.  But you know what, I want to just say that I would never be able to have such an incredible program without you every morning.  There is nobody more informed, more well-read, knows every op-ed, every story in the news than you, Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I mean it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm serious -- because I feel supported and I just feel like this is the smartest conversation on television.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every single day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And It could never be without you and without our incredible guests.  And by the way, I have an incredible support system of fantastic women around me not just onset with Dagen and Lindsey and Lee Carter and our other contributors, but also behind the scenes: Tammy, and Rachel and Gina and Courtney -- I'm not going to say everybody because I'm going to forget, but Tammy is such an incredible support and leader of this program.  And so, people don't know the women, the strong women that we have on MORNINGS WITH MARIA and I'm grateful and blessed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm blessed as well and great outfits.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, some of those were from Morocco.  So, they were my outfits that I -- I wanted to put my own outfit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could tell because you have incredible sense of style that is unique to you.  And I could tell -- and I could tell that you picked out --</p><p>WOLF:  I want to chime in.  I feel like the most powerful man in business this morning sitting in this panel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Well, good.</p><p>WOLF:  Especially between Dagen, Maria and Lindsey.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, you two are dynamic duo and everyone on the show; it's really great to be part of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  We are grateful for our viewers, that's for sure.  Because you're there every day and we appreciate and you make us smarter, so thank you to our viewers, thank you for that, Dagen.  So generous.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, the State of the Union is tonight.  Fox Business is having live coverage this evening but next, we're taking a look back at some of the most memorable moments from past presidential speeches.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  States like these and their terrorist allies, constitute in access of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction.  These regimes pose a grave and growing danger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Deja vu.  That was President George W. Bush's 2002 State of the Union address where he coined the iconic phrase the \"access of evil.\"  We're just hours away from President Trump's 2019 State of the Union tonight.  And joining us right now to talk about some of the most memorable State of the Union moments is Presidential Historian Doug Wead.  Doug, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Put the importance of the president or President Bush's access of evil comment in perspective in regards to that time in history as we look ahead to tonight?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, it was right after 9/11 so the country was very unified, but that's also the speech, Maria, with the famous 14 words saying that the British have learned Saddam Hussein tried to purchase uranium in Africa.  Which turned out to be not true.  We went to war; couldn't find weapons of mass destruction.  The world was dropped in second worst depression in history, and the Middle East has been in chaos.  So, sometimes, unity can be overrated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, unity can be -- that's interesting because we're still talking about the access of evil.  Another memorable State of the Union was 1942, speech by FDR one month after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Talk to us about this; the biggest take away of this historic one?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the great example here is what unity can do.  We lost 40 percent of our naval tonnage.  We came back, rebuilt it, built an air force, developed the atomic bomb, defeated Nazi Germany, defeated the Japanese imperial empire.  We did it all in 3 years.  You can't even build 10 miles of interstate highway in three years.  The Mueller probe has taken 2 years.  So, this shows you what America can do if it's united.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  President Lyndon Johnson would use the State of the Union in 1964 to declare war on poverty and unemployment.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNDON JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let the session of Congress be known as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this was called a watershed moment for the Johnson presidency, why?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the war on poverty.  I mean, who could be against that?  But today, it's controversial and debated both ways because we gave subsidized housing, we rewarded mothers based on the number of children they had, we gave them food stamps, we gave a bonus if they were single; it caused an epidemic of divorce in the ghettos.  Millions of young men were raised without a father and no one would want to go back to what happened.  Today, we have full unemployment among women, among African-Americans; among Hispanic, job and the American dream seems to be more powerful than just giving people money out of the concern and love for them.</p><p>WOLF:  Hey, Doug, this is Robert Wolf and I'm a big fan of history of presidents and State of the Unions.  You know, I have a question, you know, I never -- I will always remember when I was sitting with my boys when they were younger and we were watching the State of the Union and they saw half spin and half sit, and they said, I thought everyone respects a president clap.  I'm sure they said it a little differently there, probably like six and four at the time, or six and eight.  when did it become such a polarizing environment where not everyone would applaud great things and half would stand and half would sit?  I used to remember growing up, everyone would stand up and applaud.  When was the first time that you noticed that this was such political event for Congress?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, the division began in George Washington's cabinet.  Jefferson, Hamilton and it's been ongoing.  There was a time in our history when we wouldn't even celebrate the fourth of July together, each political party had their own separate celebrations, so it's been bitter.  But America went through a time of unity with Barack Obama.  We unified under the idea that we had elected an African-American as president and coming out of that, we've returned to this division and bitterness, so it's more deeply felt and seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good way to put it.  Hey, how about President Ford calling for U.S. energy independence back in 1975?  In that address, he tried to break the U.S. addiction to foreign oil.  That was ahead of his time.</p><p>WEAD:  That was amazing.  And once again, it's amazing; we were looking for energy independence, today, we've got it.  So, so unity can be overrated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and the U.S. is the number one producer.  Doug, it's good to see you as always.  Thank you.</p><p>WEAD:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business will have live coverage of the president's State of the Union address tonight.  Join us, MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Washington tomorrow.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings are in focus this morning.  Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results.  Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today.  Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p>Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening.  Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p>This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact.  The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent.  And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq.  Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices.  FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent.  CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points.  Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight.  It is the lunar holiday.  Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year.  However, Japan is open.  And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig.  How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year.  We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight.  Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency.  It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today.  We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight.  It starts at 7:00 p.m.  And then at 8:00 p.m.  We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\".  Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight.  Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig.  We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.  Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years.  Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Oh is this to me?  Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.  It is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Viacom released mixed earnings this morning.  The company beating on earnings per share but missed on revenue.  The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now.  Disney and Snap among the other names reporting later today.  We will bring you the very latest on earnings coming up.</p><p>The markets are expected to trade higher this morning certainly at the open.  Futures indicating a gain of about 87 points on the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent.  S&amp;P is up 5-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 20 points, a third of a percent.</p><p>This after a great day yesterday for stocks, the indices finishing at the highest close in two months with the Dow Industrials picking up 175 points. Three-quarters of one percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well.  The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.</p><p>Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year.  It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan.  It was down a fraction.</p><p>We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight.  The president's expected to call for unity in tonight's address.  After the recent government shutdown over border wall funding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:  He's calling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, c-o-m-i-t-y and also compromise.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight.  It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern.  And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State.  I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.</p><p>Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl.  The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: February 5, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 020503cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast this morning.  Earnings in focus, Google parent Alphabet set to weigh on THE NASDAQ after last night's results.  The stock is down better than two percent right now on the heels of an increase in spending.</p><p>Investors are watching big media this morning.  Viacom reported a revenue miss earlier, that stock is under pressure as well and Disney is out tonight after the close.  That will be the focus after the close tonight.  Meanwhile, the markets are expected to open higher today.  Take a look, Dow Industrials up 85 points right now, a third of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 is up five points and the NASDAQ up a third of a percent, 21 points higher this morning on NASDAQ.</p><p>This after a strong day yesterday.  Gains across the board, in fact, Dow Industrials were up 175 points, three quarter of one percent yesterday at 4:00.  S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with an 83-point rally better than one percent higher on NASDAQ yesterday.  Global markets this morning, European indices higher across the board, FT-100 up 1-1/4 percent, DAX Index up better than one percent, CAC quarante up about one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, well, most markets are close for the Lunar New Year.  As you see Japan was open and it was lower.  Countdown to the State of the Union back in the U.S.  President Trump set to tout the economy tonight and call for unity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It is a challenge to all of us in this country when the President stands up and says let's work together on X, or Y or Z as he will tomorrow and I hope people will hear that call.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a preview of the State of the Union coming up this morning.  Plus this, breaking bread.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell had dinner with President Trump at the White House last night and it was Powell's birthday.  We'll tell you what was discussed as we know it.  Patriots on parade.  The team celebrating its Super Bowl victory in Boston this morning.  With all of the technology focused at Sunday night new concerns about artificial intelligence on the rise.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen's Dagen McDowell, 32 Advisors CEO, former economic advisor to President Obama --</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Patriots fans.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robert Wolf.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Yes, yes.  You Patriots won again.</p><p>WOLF:  I know.  I thought we were in a slump because it was like 65 days since we won the World Series.  You know, what a can I say, it's been tough few months.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are the kinds of things that annoy people.</p><p>WOLF:  It does and I'm OK because there are so many heirs out there for my path.  I'm all right -- I'm all right to brag, you know, I get a 48 hour --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're allowed.  They're winners.  That's fine.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  -- because now you're tied with the Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins.</p><p>WOLF:  That's true.</p><p>BELL:  We'll see what happens next year.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  I hope that Jay Powell got the most delicious chocolate cake for his birthday at the White House.  Although I think that's at Mar-a-Lago and not the White House.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  Just saying.  And Rich Clarida, the Vice Chair was there at the dinner as well along with Secretary Mnuchin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder if Jay Powell said to the President, you know what, Mr. President?  You were right.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were (INAUDIBLE) we were on auto pilot.  We were (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  You know he went with the talking points exactly what he said at the press conference last week and just read the bullet points to him and they say, how about those Patriots?</p><p>WOLF:  I think your cake had a big 25 on it because we broke to 25,000 again and invite him next month when we pay 26,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  But look, it is a serious and important story that the Federal Reserve gave us the pivot, right?  I mean, what are they saying, Dagen?  They may not even raise rates this year.  It's all about the data.  They might even change the balance sheet unwind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Keep an eye on the balance sheet and there was an interesting article that was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that tried to explain why the Federal Reserve did what they did in terms of this 180-degree turn and it was kind of curious because it says they're looking at the risks down the road, so they were trying not to frighten the market and frighten investors about that they see the economy in a steep -- in some sort of steep decline.  It was very curious.</p><p>The messaging has been to borrow Stephanie Pomboy's phrase.  Real keystone cops in the last couple of months.  But ultimately they did do what President Trump suggested.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They did actually.  Meanwhile, the State of the Union is tonight.  President Trump will tout his economic success.  He'll also call for unity amid another potential government shutdown.  Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the preview of it all.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  The White House says later tonight for the State of the Union Address, President Trump will lay out some of his biggest priorities for the upcoming year.  That includes completing new trade deals, lowering the cost of prescription drug prices and of course, discussing legal and safe immigration as the President sees it.</p><p>The White House says that the President will talk about building new coalitions and healing old wounds.  Kellyanne Conway saying this morning that the speech will be as she put uplifting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY:  The President is calling for unity, he's calling for an end to retribution and resistance politics and more cooperation and compromise.  He's proven this is possible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  But the speech delayed a week comes after the longest government shutdown ever, involving a stalemate over border wall funding.  It's also quite possible there could be another shutdown over this very same issue next weekend.  And the President is threatening to declare a national emergency at the southern border.  Chuck Schumer saying yesterday, that when the President describes the State of our Union as strong, later this evening, don't believe it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  President will say predictably that the State of our Union is strong but the truth is, the state of the Trump economy is failing America's middle class, the state of the Trump healthcare system is failing American families.  And the state of the Trump administration is embroiled in chaos and incompetence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  This is the third time, Maria, that President Trump will go to Capitol Hill and address Congress, the first time he did it the first few weeks after his administration technically joint address to Congress, so last year was technically the first State of the Union, this year the second one but a different dynamic.  A much different dynamic this time around as Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats will be sitting there right behind them.</p><p>So for this hour, hour and a half, we will get real-time reaction from the Democrat leader.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We can't wait to see her facial expressions, Blake.  We'll be watching closely.  We're going to be live tonight on Fox Business with that.  Thank you so much, Blake Burman.  I want to bring in Pennsylvania Congressman and House Committee on Foreign Affairs member, Scott Perry.  For your reaction, Congressman, good to see you.  Tell us how you see tonight's big show.</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  Well, good morning, Maria and congratulations on the resident.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>PERRY:  I think it's going to be an uplifting speech.  I think the President is going to try.  Obviously, this resist issue with this President doesn't help any of us.  You can -- you can dislike the President personally, that's -- this is America, you can dislike lima beans, if you dislike them as well.  But the point is is that we don't have to work together for what's good for the country and see, you got to put some of those personal things aside.</p><p>Each of us do for the good of the country and with all due respect to Senator Schumer, I mean, talking about the economy, I mean, January is the best month in the market for a very long time, 300,000 -- plus 300,000 jobs produced in the last month.  And, finally, wage is coming up.  This tax reform that this President has shepherded through and seeing real effects for real Americans, from the top to the very bottom.  And I think you have to acknowledge that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  We just came off of the best month of January in 30 years and we do have some very strong economic numbers as the backdrop but, you know, the fighting words now are coming out through guests this evening, the White House invited 11-year-old Joshua Trump.  He's been bullied because of his last name and they're not related.  Alice Johnson whose prison sentence was commuted last year after lobbying from Kim Kardashian also on the guest list.</p><p>Democrats are inviting furloughed Federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump Golf Clubs.  Your thoughts on this aisle divide.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, , listen once again I think you got to put away your discord for whatever side, you're -- you know, if you have discord with other side no matter what side you're on.  We have to be looking to do what's best for our country, what's best for our neighborhoods.  And I guess making the political point but got to be respectful of the presidency and got to a standard of decorum in this country that has been whining overtime.  All of us have to do a little better with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so right.</p><p>PERRY:  And again, you know, working for -- doing the things we said we're going to do and working for what's best for the country even if it helps the other party a little bit, that's OK as long as it's good for the country.  Each one of us have that -- have that duty, have that responsibility.</p><p>WOLF:  Congressman, I love those words, I hope they go viral.  This is a Democrat saying that to you.  So, thank you.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I appreciate it.</p><p>WOLF:  One question I have here, I think it's on everyone's mind.  We all hate a shutdown, OK?  Left, right, center hates a government --</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  Nancy Pelosi loved it.</p><p>WOLF:  We all hate a shutdown.  So my question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>WOLF:  My question I have for you is, if there is literally no border -- no border money at the $5.7 billion, where do you think this goes and would you be supportive of the President using a national emergency for his border money?</p><p>PERRY:  Obviously I would prefer A, no shutdown and B, no national emergency having to be declared.  This is something that both -- this is a bipartisan issue that in the past both Democrats and Republicans have supported.  And we're happy to talk about things at the points of entry but I think you have to acknowledge in the -- in the month of November alone, 51,000 people apprehended between the points of entry --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not going to let you off the hook.  My question is if there is the possibility of a shutdown, would you support the government staying open and thus therefore, would you support the President allowing him to have national emergency literally going forward for His border money?</p><p>PERRY:  We should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.  So, yes, I'm going to support the border -- the government staying open and if the President is left to that only option to secure our border, then I'm going to have to support the President.  And I have to acknowledge that there's a problem at the border and we have to fix it, whether Democrat, Republican got to work together, understand that there are problems between the points of entry and there are problems at the point of entry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  We should be able to work on both of those things.  All of those things at the same time and acknowledge that regardless of who the President is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of a deal are you going to support with China?  We're less than a month away from this March 1st deadline.  The country remains under pressure because if the -- of I.P. theft, and I wonder if the President is going to allow China to get away with just buying more stuff rather than putting an end to the I.P. theft.  Kansas Senator Jerry Moran joined me along with the former COO of Microsoft, Bob Herbold on this very issue this week.</p><p>Here is what they had to say.  Got to get your reaction.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The theft that Chinese companies do of foreign businesses like American technology cost Microsoft $10 billion a year in profits.  I mean, how -- is that a fair -- is that a fair number?</p><p>BOB HERBOLD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE HERBOLD GROUP:  It is a fair number and the reason why these companies love being in China including Microsoft is that it's a huge population that has developed quickly in terms of middle-income Households.  So, it's like growing, you know, two new United States from a consumer standpoint.  This is a trade and if we make the mistake of simply talking about soybeans in regard to this trade pact that's coming.  We 'e making a huge mistake because the trust issue --</p><p>SEN. HERRY MORAN (R), KANSAS:  In a -- in a terribly dramatic way it's damaging to United States and the rest of the world, they do not play by the rules, they enforce technology transfers, steal our intellectual property, this is something that the President is right to take on, China is among our greatest competitors and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you wouldn't be -- you wouldn't accept a deal that only includes more stuff being bought by China then?</p><p>MORAN:  I think that would be mistake in the sense we would have gone through a lot of pain and not really resolved the overall issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, Congressman, some people think it's too late, it doesn't matter if China stops stealing I.P. tomorrow, they're already ahead of us in A.I.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I think they have plenty and if it -- they would be smart to stop but I would love to see a policy where we actually keep the dialogue open but treat China like China treats us.  So for instance, don't allow them to own any have any ownership in American companies as long as they don't allow us any ownership in their companies.  Don't allow the exchange of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- right now they can own 100 percent of a company in America.  Yes.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, we got -- but we got to look at changing, we have to look at changing the rules when you have a malign actor who continues to malign.  It's great to keep the conversation open but we have to protect America and China is not interested in America's interest, they're interested in China's interest.  So, easily, I think it's easy to explain to the American people.  Well, let's just treat China the way China treats us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Such a big story.  Congressman, thanks for weighing in on it.  Scott Perry joining us there.</p><p>PERRY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you here.  Be sure to tune in tonight business - Fox Business will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union Address.  We kick off at 7:00 p.m. and then MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. with the highlights of the speech.</p><p>I will be sitting down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.  Eastern.  This China story is so big.  I don't know if the people understand how enormous it is in terms of the theft.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I think we've made it too much about the tariff.  I think you've been so spot-on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  You've been speaking about the intellectual property for years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A long time.</p><p>WOLF:  And I think it's -- you know, no one's been able to put a hard line in the sand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are watching earnings this morning obviously, Viacom and Estee Lauder, both reporting this morning.  Disney, Snap reporting later today.  We're breaking down everything you need to know.  And then tech takeover.  Artificial Intelligence dominates the attention during Sunday night's Super Bowl Championship. We'll show you all about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are incredible pictures.  This is breaking news right now.  This happened moments ago.  Mexican police have beefed up their presence at the southern border.  They are in riot gear awaiting the arrival of the migrant caravan.  We're monitoring the situation and bring you updates because this is one of the criticisms that President Trump has had saying Mexico is not helping us enough.</p><p>And now you see that the Mexican police are in riot gear.  This new caravan is headed to the southern border and they will be met by this lineup of Mexican police in Piedras Negras, Mexico.  They're lined up at the border.  This is pretty incredible pictures right here.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  It also speaks to our healthy relationship with Mexico quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With ne new President, right?</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  The new President with our current President with the trade deal which is done with Canada and Mexico and how we're working in coordination with the Mexican authorities to prevent people from streaming illegally into this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This is the southern border and these pictures have just come in, so this is breaking -- this is a live picture right here.  We are looking at this live picture as it's happening right now because it's compelling given the fact they are in riot gear.  I guess the caravan is expected sooner.  I mean, I didn't know it was minutes away or within the hour that it's expected to get to the southern border.</p><p>But the migrants have been very clear, we want into the United States.  I mean, they told Griff Jenkins we're going to sneak in.  One guy -- one migrant that he spoke to said no, no, we are going to sneak in, we are on our way and we are going.  So clearly, the Mexican police are responding to this as they have lined up at the U.S.-Mexican border.  So we've got this on watch and as this story develops we will come back here and bring you the live pictures of what's happening at the southern border this morning.</p><p>Mexican police in riot gear lined up at border waiting for that caravan to arrive and it is close.  Meanwhile, we're watching earnings this morning.  Viacom shares are under pressure.  The company reporting mixed earnings.  Kristina Partsinevelos is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at the market that's about to open higher this morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, yes.  So it has opened higher but you have a company Viacom that released their earnings, revenue came in a little bit lower than expected at $3.1 billion.  You're seeing on your screen right now, it's climbing higher.  The earnings per shares adjusted also came in better than expected.  So that's why you're getting that mixed report.</p><p>You're seeing on your screen right now, it's climbing higher, the earnings per share adjusted also came in better than expected so that's why you're getting that mixed report.  The reason being though, was trading lower, now it's up a little bit higher, you had lower ad sales.  And that is a very, very similar story to what we heard yesterday from Alphabet, the parent company of Google.  Google reported their earnings and I'm still saying Google, you had earnings per share come in at $12.77.</p><p>So stronger than expected profit.  The problem though is the stock fell after tradings because of lower ad sales.  And the big concern is that you have Facebook and Google that take two-thirds of the market and Amazon is slowly starting to jump in.  And then last but not least, four earnings today, we have Disney, expectations for Disney is earnings per share to come in at $1.55.  You can see revenue at $15.1 billion.</p><p>A big, big question amongst a lot of analyst though is the streaming platform and how much revenue will be forgone to give towards the streaming platform.  I'm going to throw back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Kristina, thanks so much.  We will be watching that.  And of course, Disney after the bell is going to possibly be market mover, so we'll focus on that later.  Coming up next.  A.I. at the Super Bowl.  How Artificial Intelligence dominated Sunday night's big games.  Wait until you see the commercials.  Not sure if you recognize that.  Then, the power of Alexandria ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>The freshman Congresswoman generating such a powerful following on Twitter that some are comparing her influence to that of President Trump's RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel weighs in coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Motors turning to lay off thousands of white collar workers.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, after about 2000 employees took buyouts and another 1500 were let go, G.M. starts laying off roughly 4300 employees worldwide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOP KRISHER, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER:  Most of them will be in Detroit area, there's -- they're worldwide but G.M. of course has a concentration of white collar workers in the Detroit area mainly at the tech center in Warren.  That employs about 20,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  As many workers are handed pink slips.  The company introduces its new Silverado heavy-duty truck today.  It's a nice truck but it's coming amid some unfortunate news for the workers.  Shares are down a third of one percent in the premarket.</p><p>Lindsey Vonn crashing in the final super G-event of her career at the world championships in Sweden.  Emergency workers helped Vonn get back on her feet after she lost control and skid right through a gate hitting a safety fence.  She was able to ski down the rest of the course by herself as the crowd cheered her on.  Vaughn is an Olympic champion and a world champion.  She said last week she would retire after the world championship due to a series of injuries.</p><p>She is due to race one final time on Sunday.  And in just a few hours from now, Patriots' fans will celebrate their team's 6th Super Bowl win.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown where more than a million fans are expected.  Meanwhile, ratings for the Super Bowl, they hit an 11-year low.  CBS says total viewership hit 100.7 million views, that was about three million fewer than last year.</p><p>Live streaming, that was up 7-1/2 million devices streamed to the big game.  That actually set a new record but as viewership does decline so does ad revenues.  Super Bowl advertising sales fell more than six percent, CBS pulled in $382 million in ad sales during the game.  That was down from 408 million last year.</p><p>And speaking of commercials, you might have noticed there were a lot of robots instead of actors this year.  It's actually a creative trend that many say point to the anxiety of a future where robots replace humans in the workforce.  And Maria, you spoke about this with the former COO of Microsoft Bob Herbold as well as the chairman of Sinovation Ventures, Kai-Fu Lee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERBOLD:  It's the standard kind of jobs that require minimal kinds of training and skills that can be picked up by technology and integrated so that they're being carried out without humans.</p><p>KAI-FU LEE, CHAIRMAN, SINOVATION VENTURES:  A lot of jobs are going to change.  Almost all the jobs will change.  A.I. is not human intelligence, it's not magic, it's just a tool that can in one domain take a lot of data and make very smart decisions better than people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Advertisers are trying to ease some of the anxiety.  And you'll notice that the robots in the Super Bowl, they were always friendly, they were personal and they didn't always get it right.  So arguing that human is better to ease some of our concerns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't be compassionate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got that going for us.  We're funny.  Thank you, Lauren.  State of the Union tonight.  The Commander-in-Chief expected to a deliver a message of unity to the American people tonight amid the nation's heated debate over border security where Mexican police are lined up in riot gear right now.  We'll be speaking with RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings week in high gear, Estee Lauder and Ralph Lauren shares jumping this morning on better-than-expected earnings.  Take a look, Estee Lauder up almost 10 percent right now, Polo Ralph Lauren up almost seven percent.  Viacom had been lower.  It has turned higher, it was a mixed report.  We're breaking down all the earnings news this morning, and that is certainly moving markets.</p><p>Futures, meanwhile, expected to be up strongly up another 100 points at the start of trading, about a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is up five points right now, and the NASDAQ up 20 points also one-third of a percent higher on NASDAQ.  In Europe, the markets are also higher across the board, FT-100 up 1-1/3 percent, 93 points higher.  CAC Quarante in Paris up better than one percent as is the DAX Index in Germany, up 120 points there.  Asian markets mostly closed overnight for the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New Year.  Japan was down, however.</p><p>Countdown to the State of the Union back in the U.S., the President is calling for unity.  He will say that tonight while he threatens to call for a national emergency to fund the border wall.  The two sides digging in.  A Mexican police meanwhile are beefing up their presence at the border this morning.  These pictures just in, this is just happening right now.  These police are in riot gear.  They are waiting the arrival of the migrant caravan, which should get to the border shortly.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, breaking bread, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell having dinner with President Trump last night at the White House on Jay Powell's birthday.  Saddle up, I'm talking to the owner of a horse named, you guessed it, Maria Bartiromo.  Hey, don't bet against Maria Bartiromo.  We're going to take a look at that horse this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union, after a one week delay, President Trump is preparing to give his State of the Union Address tonight.  He is expected to call for optimism and unity as another potential government shutdown looms.  Joining me right now is RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us, Ronna.</p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC:  Thanks for having me.  Always good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what's your take?  How is the President going to say, yes, we want unity and everything is great, the economy is doing well when we know we just came off of a government shutdown, 35 days the government was a closed.  And the two sides are digging in, there's resist, resist, resist in the President's face all of the time.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, you're continuing to see the President put forward bipartisan compromise to Democrats, putting DACA on the table.  Democrats said if the government opens, we'll work with you on good faith to find a compromise.  We know there's an immigration crisis, the President did that.  So, he's going to continue to keep that theme, and he's saying \"choosing greatness\" we need to put aside our political differences.  The American people want to see us work together to solve real problems that are facing every American.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what's the plan to push back on this resist, Ronna?  I mean, are you going to have two years of nothing getting done because everything the Republicans want to try to get accomplished is met with resistance, everything the President says is met with resistance?  Do you have a plan to battle this?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, a lot of that is in the Democrats' hands.  And we've seen this since President Trump was elected with the amount of Democrats that boycotted the inauguration.  You're seeing Democrats boycotting the State of the Union tonight.  This is really where their party has gone, resist and obstruct.  Reject the results of the 2016 election because we didn't like what happened.  That's a bad precedent for our country.  We need to recognize the American people elected President Trump, and we need to do our best to help him be successful, and support our President.</p><p>The Democrats aren't doing that.  So, from the Republican's side of things, we're going to continue offering the olive branch.  We're going to say, come work with us, and I think the American people will decide, Republicans are getting things done, we're getting results, Democrats are continuing to double down on resistance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could -- I could count at least three or four Democrats who have already said, I'm not going.  They said, we don't want to be there.  So, they've already said they're not coming.  And then, there's another movement to wear white in the face of another sort of way that they're going to push back on the President.  Then, you've got all these special guests to be at the State of the Union tonight.  The President has the 11-year-old boy named Joshua Trump coming.  He's been bullied at school because of his last name.  They're not even related.  The Democrats are bringing furloughed federal workers, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.  What about this, the undocumented people working at Trump golf clubs?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the Democrats especially with the furloughed workers.  I mean, they should say to those furloughed workers.  Hey, guess what, the government is open because of the President.  If we had our way, it would still be shut cause we're not going to compromise.  So, I think it's ironic that they're bringing furloughed workers.  Listen, the President's guest exemplify the results of this administration.</p><p>Matthew Charles, the first inmate let go, because of the First Step Act, reducing prison sentences for nonviolent crimes, letting people get back into society, what a great story.  He has Alice Johnson, you have people from the Tree of Life Synagogue.  You have a couple -- a family of a couple who was killed in Nevada last month by an illegal immigrant.  So, the President's highlighting issue after issue and saying to Democrats we need to focus on policies that are going to help the American people, not partisan petty politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  They are choosing pettiness, the President is choosing greatness, and he is inviting them along with him.  Let's do great things for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good points.  What about this fight that went on on Twitter?  I mean, New York Freshman Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she's bringing the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake.  You remember this?  That was over his vote on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.  She's been a real star for Democrats.  She's got nearly 3 million followers on Twitter, more than Nancy Pelosi, more than Chuck Schumer.  Some are comparing her influence to President Trump's.  So, what about the power of AOC, do you think she is the face of this party?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, she is certainly very powerful in the Democrat Party.  And you're seeing her party move further and further left.  Listen, AOC is a socialist.  She is proposing government takeover of our education, of our health care.  We're looking at Venezuela right now and the disaster that is, and she's just trying to take us step-by-step closer to a socialist nation.  It is frightening what she's proposing.  She has no backup as to how she would pay for those things except for taxing people at a 70 percent tax rate.  That would be devastating to our country and our economy.  But all the 2020 candidates are lobbying her because they're going to need her base and her enthusiasm to win, which is just going to show how out of step the Democrat Party is becoming from mainstream America that recognizes the greatness of our country, of Democracy, of capitalism, and the ability to achieve the American Dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know what's amazing, I mean, it's like we're speaking different languages because that's not the way Chuck Schumer sees it.  You heard the sound bites earlier and Schumer -- Senator Schumer and Senator Sanders, Bernie Sanders, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times today, maybe you saw it, in support of limiting corporate stock buybacks.  Democratic Presidential contenders for 2020 are also supporting this idea.  They want to ban stock buybacks.  Is this going to be an issue for the presidential campaign, and what does this say about big government?  They're telling companies how to allocate their capital now.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  If they could, they would regulate everything.  And what they refuse to acknowledge, Maria, is jobs are coming back to this country.  We saw 304,000 jobs last month, you have wages up over three percent, growing over three percent.  The first time in a decade that you've seen that happen.  You have 4 million people now off of food stamps under the Trump administration.  Things are going great in this country, because of a couple things, deregulation, getting the government out of business, and the tax cuts, making our corporate tax cuts -- corporate tax rates competitive, and giving people more money to invest in our economy.  It is working, and Democrats can't even acknowledge that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick, Ronna, what would be victory --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDANIEL:  -- is the answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What would be victory tonight for the President?  What does he need to do to come away from this strong?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, I think the President is talking to the American people.  And they're going to see this is a President who's putting forward reasonable, sound solutions, and Democrats continue to reject it.  I don't have hope that the Democrats are going to come across the aisle and work with this President because they haven't since day one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, national emergency.  You think he'll declare national emergency then for the border?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  I don't know.  I think the President is doing the right thing, trying to take every possible step to work with Congress.  But listen, we do have a crisis at our border.  You just showed pictures of this caravan about to come across.  We know 90 percent of the heroin is coming across our southern border.  300 deaths from heroin a week.  Human trafficking is an issue.  We just saw the MS-13 shooting last night in New York City.  This is a problem that we need to address, 2,000 people are trying to cross our border illegally.  Every single day, it's only getting worse, and it's been three decades of getting nothing done in Washington.  And this is a President that doesn't settle and say OK, let's just get nothing done.  He's here to get things done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a very scary sight what we're looking at right now, Ronna, you're right.  These are live pictures from Negras, Mexico, where the Mexico police are in riot gear.  They are lined up at the border waiting for this caravan to come.  So, it looks like Mexico is assisting the United States at this point in this.</p><p>And you mentioned the MS-13 shooting, that's on the cover of the New York Post today, MS-13 on the train.  That was the southern train broad daylight shooting, and it was a gang fight.  Really scary stuff, Ronna, and this is -- this is the post this morning, by the way, everybody.  Ronna Romney McDaniel, thank you so much for weighing in this morning.  We will see you soon.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Be sure to stay with Fox Business tonight.  We've got live coverage of the President's State of the Union Address.  It kicks off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, and then MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live tomorrow morning in Washington, D.C.  Join me for the highlights from the speech.  I'll also be sitting down with a \"FIRST ON FOX EXCLUSIVE\" with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  That's tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. Eastern right here.  Join us for that special interview.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Alphabet reporting earnings last night after the bell.  The stock is down two percent.  It is off of the lows despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.  And then, focus on the Fed, what is in store for the Central Bank following Fed Chief Jay Powell's dinner last night with President Trump.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Alphabet reporting fourth-quarter earnings last night, slowing revenue growth, shrinking margins concerning investors.  Stock is down.  Joining me right now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It wasn't that bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  It just wasn't that bad.  I'm not buying this.  What is the stock down about $24.00 -- down 22 bucks, about two percent down.  I'm not buying that.  I think that Alice is saying it's down because Google, Alphabet is spending money on hiring new people and data centers.  OK, I got that.  Are they ignoring the 2 billion monthly users on YouTube which has yet to be monetized.  They seem to be ignoring that.  I just don't get it, Maria.  I'm not going to say the analysts are wrong, the market is wrong, I just don't get this particular equation.  And if I was left to guess, I'd say that Google bounces back fairly quickly to not necessarily its old high which is 12 percent high than where it is now, but certainly bounces back from this downturn that it's going to take first thing this morning.  What do you think?  What do you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it was a big number in terms of what they're spending.  You know how they have all of these other businesses that they want to --</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that they want to diversify.  But 90 percent of the business is still, what, search and advertising, right?</p><p>VARNEY:  Isn't this what they're supposed to do?  I mean, aren't you supposed to plow back your profits in to expansion, new businesses, and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true, yes.  You would think analysts like that.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you would have thought.  But this time, no.  I'm sorry, I don't get it.  But I'm not nasty about analysts or that or expectations.  I just don't get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, I know you'll have more on it.  And plus, you're going to preview Disney.  That's after the close tonight.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stu.  Thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>But first, the economy under President Trump.  The President dining with Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell last night at the White House.  It was Powell's birthday.  Then saddle up, I'm speaking with the owner of one special horse named, you guessed it, Maria Bartiromo.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are less than an hour away from the opening bell this morning.  We are expecting a gain at the start of trading about 100 points.  Investors are watching earnings.  But what also is important is what President Trump will say at tonight's State of the Union Address.</p><p>Joining us right now is Wayne Wicker, he is Vantage Point Investment Advisors' Chief Investment Officer.  Wayne, it's good to see you this morning.  Does the State of the Union matter to investors?  What do you want to see in order to move markets tomorrow -- tonight?</p><p>WAYNE WICKER, CIO, VANTAGE POINT INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Maria, I think that this is the perfect time for President Trump to come out and talk to the nation.  He's really standing on solid footing economically.  You've seen jobless claims coming in really strong, you see these earnings are coming in well.  I think that investors are really going to be focused on a level of optimism going forward in his words this evening, to propel markets higher.</p><p>BELL:  Wayne, Lindsey Bell here.  What's your read on the meeting last night, the dinner last night between Jerome Powell and President Trump and Steve Mnuchin and Richard Clarida?  What do you think markets should take from that?  Do you think that, you know, the Fed still remains independent.  What's the underlying thing to read?</p><p>WICKER:  Well, Lindsey, I think that we saw the big pivot at the beginning of this year, when we moved away from auto escalation to more of a data dependency.  I think what we saw last night was a little bit more of the same thing, where the Fed is trying to be -- quite frankly, a little bit more benign in their approach, and I think the combination of what Fed Powell is talking about as well as some of these meetings that he had with the administration, solidified that in investors' minds these days.</p><p>BELL:  What are you pricing in for rate hikes this year?</p><p>WICKER:  Well, I would say that the market probably has it right, that you don't see any inflation right now, and it's modest growth in the United States, and really not that great a growth outside the United States.  So, the market is suggesting maybe one hike later on this year.  I don't disagree with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you would buy stocks here?</p><p>WICKER:  I would absolutely buy stocks in this market.  You've seen some really strong earnings growths for the first half of earnings reporting season here.  I see that despite the fact that we had this V-shaped recovery which history would say, you may have some retracement at some point in the next few months.  I think the longer-term outlook is very strong for equities today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Wayne, great to have you weigh in.  Thank you.</p><p>WICKER:  Uh-huh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wayne Wicker joining us there.  Up next, the owner of Maria Bartiromo, the horse.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a winning combination, champions are crowned at Rodeo Rapid City in South Dakota this past weekend.  One horse went 87 points for saddle bronc riding, and the name of that horse -- Maria Bartiromo.  Joining us right now by the telephone is the owner of Maria Bartiromo the horse, Matt Burch.  Matt, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>MATT BURCH, OWNER OF MARIA BARTIROMO THE HORSE (via telephone):  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you name your horse Maria Bartiromo?</p><p>BURCH:  Well, my dad is the one that started this.  We're big time Fox News watchers.  And he was sitting there one day and he normally writes horses' names down on paper that he wants us to name, me and my brother, and he told us that he wanted us to find one horse and wanted to name it after you because you're an intelligent person, very classy, so he told us to make sure we picked it on a good one, so that age of colts we start them at 5 years old.  And for about four or five trips, we could tell that this mare right here was the most talented, classy, intelligent one of the bunch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, Matt --</p><p>BURCH:  And obviously, you can see she's very pretty.  So, I think (INAUDIBLE) you know, big white mane on her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BURCH:  After about five trips, my brother said there's our horse.  So, we put your name on it and come to find out, she is our number one horse of that colt crop, and probably one of the best ones we're hauling down the road right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, Matt, did your daddy know that there was actually another horse, a racehorse that was also named after Maria Bartiromo at one point?</p><p>BURCH:  Well, I've seen that before, yes.  And I'm sure my dad did -- probably had seen that before, but you know, from the racehorse business to where we go is the (INAUDIBLE) horse deal, two totally different kind of horses.  So, my dad is a very intelligent man, I'm sure he probably knew that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love -- I am so honored and she performed how often, Maria Bartiromo?  Yes.</p><p>BURCH:  Oh, that mare, well, she'll go about 20 trips all-year long.  She goes to all of the biggest rodeos we go to.  She's been to Houston, Texas, Clovis, California, (INAUDIBLE) Idaho, San Antonio, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Rapid City, obviously.  Las Vegas, Nevada, to the (INAUDIBLE) NFR.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.  Listen, we're going to keep checking on her.  We so appreciate it.  And I appreciate it.  I'm so honored, Matt, thank you very much.  All the best to you and your father.</p><p>BURCH:  Well, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt Burch --</p><p>BURCH:  OK.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- joining us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We got to get you to a Rodeo.  We got to go to the NFR in December.  That is rad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's do that.  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.  Stuart Varney, take it away with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2176330442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCB-D7K1-JBHT-D489-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Critics say that it's too soon to decide whether such tools can really add value to medical care, while fans suggest it's high time to make use of this information. </p><p>That's all fine, but to me, this discussion no longer matters. We are past the question of whether consumer wearables data helps clinicians, which, in their current state, are under-regulated and underpowered. We're moving on to profoundly more-capable devices that will make the current generation look like toys. Today, tech giants are working on next-generation devices which will perform more sophisticated tracking and solve more targeted problems.\u00a0Clinicians, take note of the following news items, which come from[1] The New York Times: Amazon recently invested in Grail, a cancer-detection start-up which raised more than $900 million Apple acquired Beddit, which makes sleep-tracking technology Alphabet acquired Senosis Health, which develops apps that use smartphone sensors to monitor health signals And the action isn't limited to acquisitions \u2014 tech giants are also getting serious about creating their own products internally. For example, Alphabet's research unit, Verily Life Sciences, is developing new tools to collect and analyze health data. Recently, it introduced a health research device, the Verily Study Watch, which has sensors that can collect data on heart rate, gait and skin temperature.\u00a0That might not be so exciting on its own, but the associated research program is intriguing. Verily is using the watch to conduct a study called Project Baseline. The study will follow about 10,000 volunteers, who will also be asked to use sleep sensors at night, and also agreed to blood, genetic and mental health tests. Verily will use data analytics and machine learning to gather a more-detailed picture of how cancer progresses. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. We are not looking at your father's wearables anymore \u2014 we're looking at devices that can change how disease is detected and perhaps even treated dramatically. Sure, the Fitbits of the world aren't likely to go away, and some organizations will remain interested in integrating such data into the big data stores. But given what the tech giants are doing, the first generation of plain-vanilla devices will soon end up in the junk heap of medical history.

Today, tech giants are working on next-generation devices which will perform more sophisticated tracking and solve more targeted problems.\u00a0Clinicians, take note of the following news items, which come from[1] The New York Times: Amazon recently invested in Grail, a cancer-detection start-up which raised more than $900 million Apple acquired Beddit, which makes sleep-tracking technology Alphabet acquired Senosis Health, which develops apps that use smartphone sensors to monitor health signals And the action isn't limited to acquisitions \u2014 tech giants are also getting serious about creating their own products internally. For example, Alphabet's research unit, Verily Life Sciences, is developing new tools to collect and analyze health data. Recently, it introduced a health research device, the Verily Study Watch, which has sensors that can collect data on heart rate, gait and skin temperature.\u00a0That might not be so exciting on its own, but the associated research program is intriguing. Verily is using the watch to conduct a study called Project Baseline. The study will follow about 10,000 volunteers, who will also be asked to use sleep sensors at night, and also agreed to blood, genetic and mental health tests. Verily will use data analytics and machine learning to gather a more-detailed picture of how cancer progresses. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. We are not looking at your father's wearables anymore \u2014 we're looking at devices that can change how disease is detected and perhaps even treated dramatically. Sure, the Fitbits of the world aren't likely to go away, and some organizations will remain interested in integrating such data into the big data stores. But given what the tech giants are doing, the first generation of plain-vanilla devices will soon end up in the junk heap of medical history.

I am looking forward to seeing the final form of these new regulations. But, if GDPR is any indication of how EU regulators think, it will not accomplish the stated goal of making the EU AI competitive. That said, I am a fan of the notion that it is not inevitable that big tech and nation-states have the exclusive rights to turn our data into action. This may be the most important subject for the next 100 years; that which controls the data wins! It's that simple, which means deciding what 'that' is really, really matters.

It became popular among technology companies, especially internet\u00a0\u00a0companies since Google's IPO in 2004,which adopted a dual-class share structure.\u00a0\u00a0From then on, during the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0past years, some big tech IPOs - LinkedIn, Yelp, Groupon,\u00a0\u00a0Zynga, Facebook - featured multiple class share structures.\u00a0\u00a03 Other big names\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 include Ford Motor Company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Echostar Communications,\u00a0\u00a0and Hollinger International, etc.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Super voting rights are typically conferred on common shares, resulting in the\u00a0\u00a0shareholder holding more than one vote per share. Preferred shares, which grant\u00a0\u00a0priority over common shares in terms of dividend payment, liquidation or bankruptcy\u00a0\u00a0returns, generally carry subordinate or less (sometimes even no) voting right. When\u00a0\u00a0the two classes of shareholders vote together, which they generally do with some\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0exceptions, the common share holders will enjoy a numerical share-to-share voting\u00a0\u00a0advantage, hence greater power to steer shareholder resolutions.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Super Voting Right Beneficiaries<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Founders find super voting right appealing. Inserted at the right timing, it allows\u00a0\u00a0them to raise capital without substantially diluting their control over the companies\u00a0\u00a0they found.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From shareholder control and stability comes a higher probability of board and\u00a0\u00a0management stability, which arguably contributes to thelong term strategizing of the\u00a0\u00a0company.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an anti-dilution tool, dual class shareholding structure is effective against hostile\u00a0\u00a0takeovers or forced mergers. If a bidder is successful in acquiring all outside equity,\u00a0\u00a0the disproportionately high votes held by the founder may well outnumber the bidder.\u00a0\u00a0Its effectiveness is ranked as severe as poison pill. 4<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investor Concerns<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investors see this arrangement in a different light. Some cry unfair advantage.\u00a0\u00a0Some worry that it may result in the founder imposing on resolutions that may not\u00a0\u00a0take into full account interests of the investors. The founder, together with his\u00a0\u00a0family and friends are enticed to institutionalize their positions regardless of\u00a0\u00a0performance. Last resort measures by outside shareholders to remove them from\u00a0\u00a0management positions are stonewalled. 5<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where investors accept dual class shareholding and super voting right, they must have\u00a0\u00a0done so with a tradeoff.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For extra votes yielded to the founder, investors can argue for gains in other terms,\u00a0\u00a0such as longer than average protective provisions, more matters requiring super\u00a0\u00a0majority votes of the board or of shareholder meetings and more matters requiring\u00a0\u00a0separate majority or super majority votes of preferred share holders, etc.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By adjusting the balance of power in terms otherwise standard in transactions without\u00a0\u00a0super voting right, the deal an investor can strike may not look as a turnoff as it does\u00a0\u00a0when it is first proposed.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timing and Terms<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timing of the introduction of dual class share ownership is in itself an art.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the founder, an early and established dual class share structure will help set a\u00a0\u00a0good foundation for his future dealings with rounds of investors. It will also leave\u00a0\u00a0less room for further vote dilution and change of terms and conditions. On the other\u00a0\u00a0hand, for a start-up business with neither apparent growth potential nor a competitive business model, it may not have the power to set the rules. Financing may be off the\u00a0\u00a0limits should its insistence on super voting right\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0be questionable. Some investors\u00a0\u00a0may even ask that it be dismantledbefore any investment can happen.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Somewhere down the road, when the founder's business takes shape and commands a\u00a0\u00a0respectable market recognition and share, the balance of power may change so that\u00a0\u00a0there may be room for discussions with the investors. The drawback, on the other\u00a0\u00a0hand, is that the investors,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0old and new, are going to ask for some in return for\u00a0\u00a0revisions of the terms. While the founder cannot reasonably expect a landslide addition of voting powers, it may acquire some more votes to give himself\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0comfort of added counterweight.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The matter is different in each case, and a lot depend on the interaction and trust\u00a0\u00a0between the founder and investor.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Super Voting Right for Chinese Overseas Listings<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Super voting right is not expressly allowed under the China's legal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0context. For\u00a0\u00a0limited liability companies, Art. 43 of the Company Law, 1994 as amended appears to\u00a0\u00a0allow the articles of a limited liability company to provide for voting rights not in\u00a0\u00a0strict adherence tothe underlying percentage of equity 6 while the allowance is\u00a0\u00a0removed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for joint stock companies 7 . Whether allowed or not, a company duly\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 registered with class B common shares is not foreseeable, not to mention floating of\u00a0\u00a0such share on the Chinese stock exchanges.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overseas incorporations and listings, on the other hand, do provide\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a platform for dual\u00a0\u00a0class shareholdings. For example, Section 36 of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the BVI Business Companies Act\u00a0\u00a02004 expressly provides o-shares ina company may - (c) confer special, limited or\u00a0\u00a0conditional rights, including voting rights; -o. Companies Law (2010 Revision) of\u00a0\u00a0the Cayman Islands has similar provisions to that effect. 8<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent super voting rights are permitted in offshore jurisdictions where SPVs\u00a0\u00a0are frequently incorporated for overseas financing, Chinese entrepreneurs are\u00a0\u00a0certainly not hesitant in adopting sucharrangements. They did so well before the\u00a0\u00a0Facebook IPO. Examples ofsuch incorporations with super voting rights include\u00a0\u00a0Baidu (Cayman),\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shanda Games (Cayman), Soufun (Cayman), NetQin (Cayman),\u00a0\u00a0Youku (Cayman), Renren (Cayman), Qihoo 360 (Cayman).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of the above found home for their IPOs either on NYSE or NASDAQ. Both U.S.\u00a0\u00a0stock exchanges allow listings by companies having super\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0voting shares, but prohibit\u00a0\u00a0the listed ones with dual share structure to reduce or eliminate such arrangement or\u00a0\u00a0issue a new class of super voting shares. 9<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, unless it grants a waiver, dual share listing is\u00a0\u00a0barred. 10\u00a0\u00a0It is certainly resolute in denying such\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waivers. 11<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Singapore Exchange, on the other hand, clarified its position on September 20, 2011.\u00a0\u00a0After some public discussions, it issued a regulatory guidance 12 declaring that\u00a0\u00a0companies are not allowed to list dual-class voting shares in Singapore. 13<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should the U.S. continue to offer high earnings on its market, overseas listings by\u00a0\u00a0Chinese enterprises incorporated in the BVI or Cayman Islands may well offer a\u00a0\u00a0chance to their founders for super voting right. How that right is to be configured so\u00a0\u00a0that it is acceptable\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to future investors remains a balancing act that will play out\u00a0\u00a0pursuant to the comparative powers of the players involved.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment, if the intention is to list in Hong Kong or Singapore, class B common\u00a0\u00a0shares, if existing, will have to be converted to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all other common shares to qualify.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Footnotes<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01 James Surowiecki, oUnequal Shares, Facebook's IPO and Dual ClassShare Structureso, The New Yorker, May 28.\u00a0\u00a02012, online:\u00a0\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2012/05/28/120528ta_talk_surowiecki\">http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2012/05/28/120528ta_talk_surowiecki</url>.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02 JING, Hui, oRounds of Investors Chewing Their Shares of the Facebook IPO Banqueto, Gesafe Wealth, May 25,\u00a0\u00a02012, online:\u00a0\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gesafe.com/gsnews/news.aspx?id=13631\">http://www.gesafe.com/gsnews/news.aspx?id=13631</url>.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03 James Surowiecki, supra, note 1.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04 Richard S.

But the fight is not exactly over. Yesterday's decision lets the Trump administration tap into the money while a lower court decides if the president had the power decides to divert funds when he declared a national emergency back in February. CNN's Boris Sanchez joining us now from the White House. So is this victory lap a bit premature?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You could certainly see it that way, Fred. This is a victory for the White House, but it does come with a caveat. You're right, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether it was appropriate for the White House to use this money as a lower court determines whether it's appropriate for the White House to use this money, period. In other words, the Supreme Court ultimately decided to unfreeze these funds as the bigger case makes its way through the lower courts.</p><p>So ultimately the Supreme Court can decide that it's inappropriate for President Trump to use these military funds to build his long-promised border wall. President Trump is celebrating anyway. Here's what he tweeted out this morning. The president writing, quote, \"Wow, big victory on the wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows southern border wall to proceed. Big win for border security and the rule of law.\" So no question, this is a win for the White House, albeit a temporary one because so far it hasn't been determined ultimately whether the president can use that money or not in the long term, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. And then, Boris, there has been swift reaction to the president's Twitter attack on Elijah Cummings. The president writing Cummings, I'm quoting now, \"district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous and filthy place.\" That coming from the president's Twitter. So Boris, talk to me about the reaction not just from Cummings but from the House Speaker and other fellow members of Congress.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, that's right, Fred. This comes on the heels of the president's attacks on other Democrats of color. So there are obviously questions about race baiting and the stylistic questions about a president speaking this way about a member of Congress and about a community in which a diverse group of people live, not only ethnically, but also in terms of income. The president's tweet, to say the least, is misinformed.</p><p>Representative Cummings fired back on Twitter. Take a look at what he sent out, writing, quote, \"Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning I wake up and go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch, but it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also weighed in, Fred. She writes that Representative Cummings is a champion in the Congress and the country for civil rights and economic justice, a beloved leader in Baltimore and deeply valued colleague. We all reject racist attacks against him and support his steadfast leadership.\" She writes a hashtag, \"#ElijahCummingsIsAPatriot.\"</p><p>We should point out this attack from President Trump coming just a few days after Elijah Cummings was on the House Oversight Committee challenging DHS officials on the issue of immigration. President Trump clearly not taking well to that, and this is ultimately how he lashes out, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Boris Sanchez, thank you so much.</p><p>With me right now, Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration reporter for the \"New York Times,\" and Laura Barron-Lopez, a national political reporter for \"Politico.\" Good to see you both. So, Laura, you first. Let's talk just briefly about the president's Twitter rant, how he wants to spent time doing this, singling out a leader of Congress who so many have said is in exemplary fashion is an advocate for so many, and the president would take it to these levels, using the word \"infestation,\" \"rat,\" all that. What's this all about? Why does he keep doing this?</p><p>LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"POLITICO\": So he does this because he knows that it riles up his base. This is a pattern with President Trump. He has said this not only about Cummings, but he said this about four elected women of color in tweets just a few weeks ago, saying they could go back to countries from which they came when actually three of those women -- all of them are American citizens, but three of them were born in the United States, which then elicited a \"send her back\" chant at his North Carolina rally.</p><p>And this is a strategic move by Trump. It's one that he knows plays well with his base. And he very much, whether it's from immigration or these tweets about Cummings, is hoping to make the 2020 election about racial identity, which is something he did as well in 2016.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And, Caitlin, you don't even want to dignify the president's tweet by having to talk about it. Yet at the same time it needs to be talked about because this is the leader of the country, the leader of the country making such disparaging remarks about fellow leaders of this country and in this election season. People have choices to make.</p><p>[14:05:13] CAITLIN DICKERSON, NATIONAL IMMIGRATION REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": That's right, it's unfortunate to have to have this conversation at all. But it is important to point out, as we are here, that the president is drawing from an age-old playbook, if you will, over how to invoke race-based smear campaigns and how to stoke support by doing so. He's done it in campaign rallies, he did it after protesting in Charlottesville. It's not a mystery, but it is important to point out that it's a strategic move. It's not an accident that words like \"infestation,\" that rats and rodents are being invoked. It's something that we've seen so many times in history, and he's repeating that now.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK, so now let's talk about this Supreme Court decision allowing the president, at least temporarily, to use U.S. military money for his wall project. And this really helps, Laura, the president revive his mantra during the 2016, build the wall, build the wall, and now he's able to step it up a notch. How advantageous, even if it's temporary, might it be for the president?</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: This is definitely something the president is going to be talking about nonstop. Immigration is going to be a huge policy issue for him heading into the 2020 election. But it's also important to point out that while he may have had a small victory when it comes to being able to use these funds in the immediate sense to try to get the ball rolling on building a wall, one of his big promises during the 2020 election was that Mexico would pay for the wall. And that's the case with the victory that he is claiming from the Supreme Court. This money is coming --</p><p>WHITFIELD: Might his supporters have forgotten about that?</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: Potentially, although, I find it surprising that they would have given it was one of his biggest claims during the 2016 campaign. But this money is coming from military personnel and from training programs.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And when we say this ruling might give the president temporary license to use that money because there's still a lower court that has to decide whether the president did a good job establishing that this was a national security issue, a national emergency in which to have this wall built.</p><p>So Caitlin, the president also touting yesterday this agreement, an agreement with Guatemala that it would act as a place in which migrants could stay if they were speaking asylum. But it's still unclear the details of this arrangement with Guatemala. Where does this take the president in his direction of securing the border or using methods, perhaps even this plan, as a deterrent for those seeking asylum.</p><p>DICKERSON: Sure. I think that we can think about actually both of these, what we're calling wins, the Supreme Court's decision on a border wall and this what's known as a safe third-country agreement with Guatemala, as symbolic victories, perhaps, for the president but ones that have really significant practical down sides.</p><p>I've covered immigration for a long time. There is consensus among federal enforcement officials that a wall is not necessary to decrease the already lowering numbers of border crossings illegally across the southwest border. And when you look at the agreement made with Guatemala, this is one to require Central Americans to apply for asylum in Guatemala first before they can come to the United States.</p><p>But, Fred, the majority of people who are seeking asylum in the United States right now are from Guatemala. So the idea that they will find, that other Central Americans might find a safe haven in Guatemala, those who are fleeing persecution and violence, is really hard to understand. It's also important to mention that this agreement that the Guatemalan government made flies in the face of a recent high court decision there that determined the Guatemalan president could not sign an agreement with the United States government without approval from the Guatemalan congress. They've gone ahead and done so anyway.</p><p>So these are two symbolic wins, sure, for the president, but ones that when you look at the police, when you look at the actual numbers and the way the immigration system is going to be affected, they don't make practically make sense or follow along with what experts on both sides of the aisle are suggesting.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And Laura, what would be the incentive for Guatemala to engage in plan like this that would mean, whether it's Salvadorans or Hondurans, anybody who would be trying to seek asylum in the U.S. would then make Guatemala home if not temporary, then permanently?</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: Right. There have been questions about Trump placing pressure on these Latin American countries, whether by tariffs or whether by different agreements that they could potentially have.</p><p>[14:10:06] And so the increased pressure from the administration on trying to come to the table on these agreements I think is what maybe forced Guatemala's hand. Of course, Caitlin has covered this much more extensively and I think she might have a bit more details on that.</p><p>DICKERSON: The United States is a very important trade partner for Guatemala. Mexico, Central America rely very significant on the United States government in order to trade, in order to support their own economies. And so that's why you've seen the Guatemalan government move forward with this agreement. That's why you've seen the government of Mexico agree to crack down on asylum seekers who are crossing through that country, because the United States has a lot of power over the economies of these places, and President Trump is using that to try to achieve his own goals even if it means keeping legitimate asylum seekers out of the United States.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Largely for agricultural reasons. Caitlin Dickerson, Laura Barron-Lopez, good to see you both. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: Thank you.</p><p>DICKERSON: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Still ahead, Democrats in the House taking a bold new step as they seek impeachment proceedings against the president. Plus, riot police charge a group of protestors in Hong Kong as demonstrations take a violent turn there. More coming up.</p><p>[14:15:00] WHITFIELD: Welcome back. As President Trump openly feuds with House Democrats, the number of them calling for impeachment is growing, now at 101. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler escalating the fight, saying he's going to court early next week to try to enforce a subpoena for former White House Counsel Don McGahn, a key witness that could prove to be a big step into launching an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We are continuing an investigation of the president's malfeasances, and we will do what feel -- and we will consider what we have to consider, including whether we should recommend articles of impeachment to the House. That's the job of our committee. We may decide to recommend articles of impeachment at some point, we may not. That remains to be seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: I'm joined now by Michael Zeldin who once served as a special assistant to Robert Mueller at the Justice Department. Good to see you, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL ZELDIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Hi, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So Nadler asking a federal judge, Friday, to release Mueller's grand jury materials. What kind of material would be in there to help support any kind of impeachment inquiry?</p><p>ZELDIN: All of the underlying witness testimony is what is contained within the grand jury that Nadler wants to see. So it's a way of getting the testimony of witnesses that the White House has blocked from appearing before his committee, so it's a backdoor way to try to get to see what they said directly.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK, so Congress has the sworn duty, right, and responsibility of impeachment, oversight as a real process of holding the president accountable. But Nadler is essentially circumventing the process, saying his committee has in effect been conducting an impeachment inquiry. Could that backfire? Is there any real difference there, even?</p><p>ZELDIN: I'd like to think of what Nadler is saying or interpret what Nadler is saying as saying he's conducting a preliminary inquiry to determine whether or not a full impeachment hearing and articles of impeachment are warranted. So he's taking the preliminary steps to gather the information that he feels he needs to reach a determination as to whether that full impeachment inquiry is warranted by the facts.</p><p>Whether it could backfire is a political question, and we'll just have to see whether the American people are tired of this, or the Mueller testimony still spurs them to want to know more.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And in fact, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying essentially wait, gather more information, that it is vital to do so. So without grand jury materials or any kind of subpoena enforcement, is there another route in which to get information, the kind of information that Pelosi or even Nadler would be talking about?</p><p>ZELDIN: It's going to require court assistance for that to happen. The president has asserted executive privilege and other immunities for these witnesses that have been called. Congress and others have sought from the courts relief from that objection, and if the courts comply, then they'll get that information that way.</p><p>But otherwise, if the stonewalling continues and the grand jury material is not presented, then Nadler may have to open a full impeachment proceeding in order to give the committee more rights to get this information, because once you open up a full impeachment -- call it an impeachment inquiry, your rights to gather information expand.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Michael Zeldin, thanks so much. We'll leave it there for now.</p><p>ZELDIN: Thanks, fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Still ahead, a chaotic scene in South Korea. More than a dozen hurt, two killed when a nightclub balcony collapses. Among the injured, several American athletes. Details right after this.</p><p>[14:22:39] WHITFIELD: Welcome back. We're following this developing news in Hong Kong where anti-government protests are turning increasingly violent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SHOUTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Police in riot gear are launching tear gas at protestors who were marching against last weekend's violence that left 45 people injured. Police later confronted a group of protestors at the airport train station as the demonstrators emptied fire extinguishers toward officers. CNN's Anna Coren tells us what happened when she got caught up as police charged a sit-in at the subway station.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We were outside the train station, and normal riot police had arrived. They were telling us to move on. It was really just the media. We came up the escalators, and this is where inside the train station which is where the attacks last Sunday took place were a few hundred protestors, probably about 100 media and 150 hardcore protestors. And when I say hardcore, the ones who haven't gone home as yet.</p><p>Anyway, we were standing there, waiting to do the live shots with you, and suddenly tactical police ran up the stairs, up the escalators, charged at not just protestors, but also at the media. They hit our security guard with a baton. And they were just -- they were just hitting people, hitting people left, right and center. It was absolute chaos.</p><p>Suddenly everybody then surrounded them, and I guess there was this feeling of, what are you doing? Why are you behaving this way? Particularly considering we've been here since 3:00 this afternoon and things have been quite orderly with the police. They move in a line. They beat their shields. They come up with a sign, I should say, telling protestors they're going to disperse tear gas. They fire the tear gas. People retreat.</p><p>But now that they're cornered inside this train station, for the tactical police to run up these elevators and just start hitting people. It was just absolute pandemonium. It was nothing that we have ever witnessed before.</p><p>[14:25:04] And the protestors as well, they despise the police after the brutality that happened on the first of July, after the attacks that took place here last Sunday, it took police more than 40 minutes to respond. And then for these tactical police to charge protestors and the press. We are wearing bibs. We are wearing bibs. I'm not quite sure what is happening now. OK, it looks like they are -- there's an older man, they're asking protestors to go home, to go home. That is what he is saying. He's asking people to go home. Certainly, from some of the protestors that we've spoken to -- that's right. But from the protestors we have spoken to, they can't believe that the police behaved this way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Anna Coren, thank you so much for your reporting out of Hong Kong.</p><p>A championship celebration quickly turned to chaos for the U.S. water polo team. Last night four players from the men and women's teams were injured when a balcony at a nightclub in South Korea collapsed. Two South Koreans died. CNN Sports Correspondent Patrick Snell with me now. So thankfully those athletes did not get seriously injured, but this was a deadly accident. Pretty frightening.</p><p>PATRICK SNELL, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact, Fred, that, sadly, two people did die in the incident, two South Korea natives according to reports there. But broadening it out, this was an event taking place, this was a nightclub close to the athletes' village there in Gwangju in South Korea. And at the end of competition, it would be traditional for athletes to go out and enjoy responsibly a night out and let your hair down, so to speak. And that's what was happening here. The U.S. teams, both men and the women, they were celebrating yet another success, a third straight title for the women's water polo team, a fantastic achievement in itself, beating Spain in the showdown there.</p><p>But what happened here was that there were injuries to four athletes in total. I do want to quickly run through them and we can put names on them as well. On the U.S. women's water polo team, first up, Kaleigh Gilchrist, she actually suffered a laceration to her leg that would require surgery in that case. Her teammate, Paige Hauschild, as well she suffered injuries, along with the men's, on the men's side of things, the water polo players there, Johnny Hooper and Ben Hallock they were also hurt. But we do understand the good news that they're not serious injuries.</p><p>We did also get a statement as well from the U.S. Federation for that particularly sport confirming that incident in the nightclub. I want to get to this, the salient part. \"All USA Water Polo athletes are safe and accounted for.\" Thoughts are with all of those as well. Also sending out thoughts and prayers as well to all concerned.</p><p>And I do want to note as well, Fred, that There were other countries, athletes from other countries as well, including New Zealand and Australia, and again, happy to report there that no injuries, no serious injuries to those athletes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And this was as simple as just the building, a portion of it, just compromised.</p><p>SNELL: Yes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: It collapsed.</p><p>SNELL: Yes, right. The balcony up above, reports indicate that an investigation is ongoing. We'll continue through the weekend, I'm quite sure, and beyond to try and ascertain exactly what happened in that nightclub.</p><p>As for the U.S. teams, next order of business for them, if you like, there off to Lima, Peru, for the Pan American Games. We have the opening ceremony to that on Friday down there in Lima. So that's now officially under way. They're going to be beginning competition there August the 4th. So again, it will be interesting to see, are we going to be seeing those athletes like Kaleigh Gilchrist, for example, Paige Hauschild competing.</p><p>WHITFIELD: With injuries.</p><p>SNELL: Right. We'll be watching that very closely. Of course, next year it's the really big one, the summer games, the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>WHITFIELD: That's right. And hopefully everybody is ready for that one. Patrick Snell, thank you so much, appreciate it. Still to come, 2020 candidates preparing for round two of the CNN Democratic debates are now just three days away. So what they each need to do to break away from the crowded field, next.</p><p>[14:32:56] WHITFIELD: This weekend 2020 Democrats are canvassing across the country, making their cases to voters ahead of next week's CNN debates. And among them, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is hosting two events in New Hampshire this afternoon. She'll take part in a town hall in just a couple of hours. CNN Political Reporter Rebecca Buck is in New Hampshire.</p><p>REBECCA BUCK, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: That's right, Fred. We're here in New Hampshire with Elizabeth Warren. It's her first of two campaign spots today on this pre-debate weekend. She is trying to carry this momentum from the campaign trail all the way to Detroit on Tuesday night when she's going to be sharing the stage with Bernie Sanders. They're first meeting on the same stage in this race. And of course, they are the two liberal icons in this race, both jockeying for a very similar part of the electorate.</p><p>And so we're waiting to see will Elizabeth Warren try to start trying to start drawing contrasts with Bernie Sanders, will she stick to her stump speech, her core message on the debate stage here today in New Hampshire.</p><p>I want to bring in Rob. He's a community organizer. He's here attending this Warren event that going to be begin shortly here in Bow, New Hampshire. And he isn't yet supporting a candidate in the race, but I would like to get your take, Rob, on what you want to see from Elizabeth Warren in this debate on Tuesday?</p><p>ROB CLAFLIN, NEW HAMPSHIRE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZER: I think the real key question is the difference between the public option and Medicare for all. And if she can explain what I have yet to hear anybody who favors Medicare for all explain exactly what would happen in the first year of that transition from private health care to Medicare for all. And I think it's a very difficult sell, but I'd love to hear her tell us how she plans on doing it.</p><p>BUCK: And what do you think she should do with Bernie Sanders on that stage? Do you think it's important that she draw contrast with Sanders on policies, style, or do you think she should just stick to her own policy and her own platform.</p><p>CLAFLIN: I think she should stick to her own policy and her own platform. She's really doing great here in New Hampshire. She's got maybe the best organization in New Hampshire, and she's setting out to buy coffee for every voter in New Hampshire, and she's well on the way to doing that.</p><p>[14:35:06] So she's doing just fine. And I think she should stay out of interparty squabbles and just tell us what she plans to do.</p><p>BUCK: Thank you so much. I know you'll be watching the debate on Tuesday. And of course, we will be watching as well.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren hit a very important milestone this week in her campaign, meeting one million donations for the very first time, a huge number for her campaign, reflecting the enthusiasm that we're seeing in the polling and on the campaign trail. The question, of course, heading into Detroit is will Elizabeth Warren be able to build and continue that momentum. We're going to see here today the approach she's taking, the themes she's hitting, the message that we might hear from her later this weekend. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Rebecca Buck, thank you so much.</p><p>Some of the other candidates also out on the campaign trail honing their messages today as they prepare to face off in the debates. As Gloria Borger explains, for those who don't find a way to stand out on a crowded stage, it could mean the end of the campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: At his kickoff rally, California Congressman Eric Swalwell was center stage. But at the first primary debate, he was nearly off the stage.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL, (D) CALIFORNIA: Walking out is -- that is really intimidating. You're just pointing to people. I don't know if I know you or not. But I'm pointing, I'm waving, and you feel like you're just completely vulnerable, and everyone is looking at you.</p><p>BORGER: That debate would be his last.</p><p>SWALWELL: Today ends our presidential campaign.</p><p>Our JUST polling stayed flat. IT didn't go anywhere.</p><p>BORGER: Remaining at less than one percent. And as the field lines up for the two CNN debates, the pressure is really on, because in the fall, securing podium spotting will be twice as hard. So Detroit could be the end of the trail.</p><p>ROBBY MOOK, 2016 HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Maybe 12, 13 candidates, there's not going to be another shot after this. To some extent not qualifying for the next debate is a death sentence.</p><p>STUART STEVENS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: There's a lot of ways to screw up at a debate. What's essential is to think about what can I do so that there won't be a total disaster here.</p><p>BORGER: McCain attack phrases, Bradley attack praises.</p><p>Stuart Stevens has prepped Republican candidates from George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to Mitt Romney.</p><p>STEVENS: Ideally before a debate, you look at your polling and you'd say, who do I need to talk to? You would never make an ad that just says, I don't know, I'm not sure if it's going to apply to you. It would be like shooting a shotgun in the air and hoping the ducks fly by.</p><p>MOOK: What really drives coverage in these debates is friction. It is taking someone on.</p><p>BORGER: As Kamala Harris did, attacking Joe Biden's record on bussing.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.</p><p>STEVENS: She's one once she says that because she's defined herself, and she got her bio. And you like that person and you're pulling for that person.</p><p>BORGER: So it didn't seem contrived?</p><p>STEVENS: There's a difference between prepared and contrived. I think prepared is you've thought about it. She's comfortable talking about race, and it shows.</p><p>BORGER: Biden was uncomfortable being challenged in that way, and that showed too.</p><p>STEVENS: You're president of the United States or you're vice president. You walk in a room, people usually applaud, and you're not used to having somebody get in your face.</p><p>BORGER: If you were advising Joe Biden right now, what would you tell him to do?</p><p>MOOK: Be on offense.</p><p>BORGER: Offense.</p><p>MOOK: Be on offense. You are there to win votes. You are not there to defend your lead.</p><p>BORGER: That's fine if you're Biden, or if you're Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders fighting over many of the same voters. But if you're not a name-brand candidate, breaking out can be hard to do.</p><p>STEVENS: There's other alternatives up there that are acceptable. There's always this question like, why are you on the shelf? Do we really need eight variations of barbecue potato chips?</p><p>SWALWELL: When you're speaking, you feel the glare of the moderators looking at you like you're not a top-tier person. Stop speaking.</p><p>BORGER: What are you doing here?</p><p>SWALWELL: Yes, yes. You can feel that.</p><p>BORGER: So you had like five minutes?</p><p>SWALWELL: Four minutes and 45 seconds.</p><p>BORGER: But who's counting? But who's counting? What can you do really in that amount of time?</p><p>SWALWELL: Have a moment that gets replayed.</p><p>If we're going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.</p><p>BORGER: Do you think you got a little too torchy there?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SWALWELL: Again, I thought all of these issues, as someone who has worked on gun violence and student loan debt, that many of them are generational.</p><p>BORGER: Did it look a little contrived, too many torches?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>[14:40:00] SWALWELL: Yes, maybe I could have done one fewer torch.</p><p>BORGER: In these debates, preparation can be everything.</p><p>MOOK: You can't do it for five minutes here or there. They get no lifeline. It's them, it's the camera, the audience, the moderator, and the opponents.</p><p>BORGER: No phone a friend?</p><p>MOOK: There's no phone a friend. And they're going to sink or swim. And this is an important test in the process.</p><p>BORGER: And after all that studying and all those rehearsals, how does it feel backstage when your candidate goes off script?</p><p>MOOK: It's a very special feeling when you're standing there watching the television and you're thinking, what are they doing? That is not what we said, right? On the other hand, I will say, as a campaign manager, there is no way for you to know what it is like.</p><p>BORGER: Public failure is never easy, but with 20 candidates, it's more than likely.</p><p>STEVENS: You have to be willing, first of all, to admit that you're probably going to lose, and be willing to lose and stand for something. You can try too hard running for president, and it will always come back and bite you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BORGER: So it's a fine line for every candidate on stage, impress, but don't look like you're trying too hard. You know, Fred, just be yourself.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So fascinating. Thank you, Gloria, appreciate it. And don't miss two big nights of CNN Democratic debates, this Tuesday and Wednesday, live from Detroit. It all starts at 8:00 each night only on CNN.</p><p>Up next, a massive man hunt under way in Canada. After several brutal murders. Police now say the killers could be getting help from unsuspecting people. More, right after this.</p><p>[14:45:42] WHITFIELD: Police in Canada are asking people to stay vigilant and alert as they track down two teens accused of killing three people. They say the suspects are considered armed and dangerous. And now police are stepping all patrols in rural north Manitoba. That's where the two suspects were last seen. This is new video of the suspects. Investigators think they may have changed their appearances to escape from the region. And they may have received help from a local unwillingly.</p><p>Police originally thought the teens had gone missing after discovering their burning car on the side of the highway, but now authorities call them the prime suspects in the killings of an American tourist and her Australian boyfriend, as well as a Canadian university lecturer. CNN's Polo Sandoval is tracking this developing story.</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fred, that search is intensifying this weekend as authorities now going door to door in the small community in Gillam, Manitoba, in their search for these two subjects. Investigators have really been focusing on that small community of about 1,200 now for the last several days. That's where the suspects' vehicle was located on Monday, which was the last corroborated sighting of both Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky. Investigators believe that they likely could still be in that area. However, they do believe that a resident in and around that community may have unknowingly assisted the two in some way, shape, or form. But investigators not saying exactly how.</p><p>So they're releasing this surveillance video that was shot on Sunday in Saskatchewan in an attempt to try to generate some leads here. As for the residents in that small community of Gillam, many of them are living in fear according to our conversations that we have had with the deputy mayor there at this. Many of the residents there simply taking a wait and see kind of approach. But they're locking their doors, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Polo Sandoval, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook forced to pay the largest fine in FTC history. An investigation finding the tech giant lost massive amounts of user data. More coming up.</p><p>But first, a former New York City police officer's opioid addiction almost killed him. But now he's taking control of his life, and he's helping others to do the same. His story is today's Turning Points. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK RESTIVO, FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND ADDICT: I wanted to be a New York city police officer from the time I was a kid. I was never able to really apply myself to anything because I'd rather party. I used marijuana. I abused Adderall, cocaine, Oxycodone, Methadone. So it took me a little while. I didn't get into the police academy until I was 28.</p><p>I went cold turkey on the first day of the police academy from using pain killers. I didn't touch a pill for a couple of years, and then I got hurt. I was chasing after a few guys in a subway station. I got thrown down a flight of stairs, busted up my knee and my back. Before I left the hospital, they gave me a prescription for 10 Vicodin. By the time I got home that night, I was already through that prescription.</p><p>I wasn't aware that I was addicted until way after I retired from the police department. I was constantly buying and selling and using pills. I made about $5,000 a month.</p><p>My ex-wife forced me to go to treatment. I've been clean and sober for five-and-a-half years. I currently work with a long-term residential treatment facility with young men between the ages of 19 and 30. I like to share that I was a police officer. It could be anybody. There's no face to this addiction.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Welcome back. $5 billion, that's how much Facebook is being forced to pay up over privacy breaches. The social media giant reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission after a sweeping investigation revealed how the company lost control over massive troves of personal data and mishandled its communications with users. CNN tech reporter Donie O'Sullivan joining me right now. So Donie, good to see you. So this is the largest fine in FTC history, but it's not exactly hurting Facebook, is it?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN POLITICS AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: That's right, Fred. Facebook really got off the hook here. It sounds strange to say that when it is a historic $5 billion fine. But when you put that in perspective, that is only about one month of the company's revenue. And in fact, when word of this fine came down a few weeks ago, Facebook's stock price actually went up. So I think they really did get away with quite a lot here.</p><p>And it was quite a serious breach of users' trust. There was multiple things here, including, of course, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but they were asking users for their phone numbers supposedly to help them as a security feature, to help them with their passwords, but they were actually targeting users with advertising using their phone numbers as a result of that.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So how does this deal with Facebook protect users from future privacy breaches?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes. So there's quite a few mechanisms in the deal for that, including that Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, is going to have to personally certify that Facebook is complying with certain parts of this FTC order.</p><p>[14:55:00] But when you think about it and you look at this deal itself, regulators here really don't have much teeth. So it's difficult to see if Facebook does do this, will anything come of it, will they be enforced. And what's interesting that the FTC has five commissioners, three Republicans and two Democrats. And despite all of the talk from the Trump administration about being tough on big tech, it was the two Democrats that voted against this settlement from the FTC, saying that they were going too easy on Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg and Charles Hamburg (ph) weren't even deposed as part of this.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And now I want to ask you about 2020 Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. She was the most searched candidate during the first round of debates. And now her campaign is actually suing Google. Why?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, that's right. We learned this earlier during the week that during the first Democratic debate, there was a huge surge of interest apparently in Tulsi Gabbard through Google searches in the U.S. In the days after that, Gabbard's Google ads account got suspended, which means that basically when you search Gabbard's name, what the campaign wanted to do was provide ads saying vote for Gabbard. It was suspended for a few hours, came back. Google says that it was a mistake. Gabbard says it was something more, that Google has it in for her campaign.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Donie O'Sullivan, always good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>And thank you so much for joining me today. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We'll have so much more straight ahead in the Newsroom. I'll see you again tomorrow. Ana Cabrera is next.</p><p>[15:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019072705CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNS-8TY1-JB20-G161-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 27, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>UNITED STATES WATER POLO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Carol Costello. Thank you so much for joining us.

It was unfair to me, and fundamentally, it was unfair to your readers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: We're taking a closer look at that report that called out more than 100 elected officials.</p><p>Plus, a big shift for a big-tech company. Apple is changing its tune when it comes to how safe their computers are.</p><p>But we begin this morning because it's just 24 hours, we'll begin at the Supreme Court. It's expected to hand down one of its most important decisions in years.</p><p>Justices will rule on <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>health care law and whether the government can force you to buy health insurance. It's a momentous decision that could impact everything from your health to the presidential election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The American people understand that we're not going to make progress by going backwards. We need to go forwards. They understand we don't need to refight this battle over health care.</p><p>It's the right thing to do that we've got 3 million young people who are on their parents' health insurance plans that did haven't it before.</p><p>It's the right thing to do to give seniors discounts on their prescription drugs. It's the right thing to give 30 million Americans health insurance that didn't have it before.</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As you know, the Supreme Court is going to be dealing with whether or not Obama care is constitutional.</p><p>If it's not, if Obama care is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people.</p><p>If it's not -- if it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing, we're going to have to voluntary a president, and I'm not one that's going to get rid of Obama care. We're going to stop it on day one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: Now, the U.S. Supreme Court could rule in a number of ways. Here are the four most likely scenarios. The entire law could be upheld or the entire law could be struck down.</p><p>Another possibility is that the justices could strike only the individual mandate. That's the requirement that most Americans buy health insurance.</p><p>Or they could strike down the mandate and the bans on discrimination. That is, insurance companies having to accept people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>Congressional correspondent Kate Bolduan is in Washington. Good morning, Kate.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Carol. So to remind our viewers, Carol, what the justices, the nine justices are really considering, they need to answer really four main issues that they took up in this monumental case that they heard oral arguments for more than six hours back in March.</p><p>So the main question is the centrepiece, will the individual mandate stand or will it fall? The individual mandate, of course, requiring the nearly all Americans have health insurance come 2014 or they pay a penalty.</p><p>The second question is, if the individual mandate falls as struck down, does the rest of the law -- can the rest of the law stand or does that need to fall as well?</p><p>Also, the court is considering does the law's expanded Medicaid program unfairly step on states' rights. States argue that they're being coerced to take on more of the cost of the expanded Medicaid program because more people will be joining that program.</p><p>And finally, this is kind of considered the sleeper issue, if you will, though an unlikely scenario, will the court call for kind of a legal time-out? Because some would say under an obscure law called the Anti-Injunction Act that the lawsuits can't be filed until the entire law goes into effect, which would be after 2014. That's an unlikely thing to happen but, of course, the justices can do what they like. That's what I can say.</p><p>COSTELLO: Yes, they can. We should know the answer hopefully by, what, 10:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow.</p><p>BOLDUAN: At 10:00 a.m. Eastern is when they will start. It's unclear how long it will take for them to announce all four issues, but we will be there ready and waiting.</p><p>COSTELLO: Kate Bolduan, thank you.</p><p>So if the law stands, if the Supreme Court rules it's constitutional, who will foot the bill for this thing, well, CNN has compiled a list.</p><p>Starting next year, individuals who make more than $200,000 a year will pay a Medicare surtax. The uninsured will also pay more. Anyone choosing not to buy insurance will have to pay a penalty under the individual mandate. And if you use a flexible spending account, the cap will be $2,500 and there will be new penalties.</p><p>Stay with CNN for complete coverage of the health care ruling. In about 20 minutes, Dr. Sanjay Gupta will join us to explain exactly how patients could be affected.</p><p>And of course, the Supreme Court's decision is expected tomorrow morning. We'll have team coverage.</p><p>COSTELLO: Other big story coming out of Colorado. And the images are as ferocious as they are mesmerizing. Here's the latest for you.</p><p>Right now, there are at least ten large fires burning. The total amount of land involved, nearly 170,000 acres and counting. The fast-moving flames are sweeping towards dense subdivisions and chasing 32,000 people from their homes around Colorado Springs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS PHARR, EVACUEE (via telephone): At the time, they told us -- they put us in a pre-evac situation, I thought, you know it will go north of us, it will go south, and it will go further west. And then you step outside, you look across the drainage ditch there, sigh that hill on fire. That really smacks you on the face.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) COSTELLO: CNN's Jim Spellman is in Colorado Springs. Jim, last hour, I talked with someone from the Colorado Springs Fire Department, she says people are terrified?</p><p>JIM SPELLMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They absolutely are. Yesterday in the evening, these winds picked up and went up to about 65-mile-an- hour gusts. And it jobs not one, but two fire lines, in just a matter of a couple of hours and tore into these subdivisions.</p><p>We still don't have an accurate assessment of how many homes have been lost, but we do know that this fire more than doubled in size overnight. It's now over 15,000 acres.</p><p>It's just unbelievable how fast the complexion of this fire changed driven by those high winds, high temperatures and extremely low humidity.</p><p>As this was happening last night, fire officials called for help from all jurisdictions, north, south, Denver, Pueblo, anybody that could come and help. And they're really in an all hands mode right now trying to save as many structures as they can.</p><p>Even the Air Force Academy has been evacuated. As you mentioned 32,000 people have been forced from their homes. All the hotels here are full. People are taking people into their homes.</p><p>People are sleeping on gymnasium floors and shelters. It's become an extreme situation here in really just a matter of hours -- Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: Jim Spellman reporting live for us this morning.</p><p>In Florida, it's a different story. Drenching rains are tapering off today, but it may be a while before the floodwaters retreat. Debby is now a tropical depression.</p><p>But it dumped nearly 2 feet of rain in some areas leaving entire towns washed in knee-deep water. George Howell is in the Florida panhandle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LARRY PESEK, FLOOD EVACUEE: It's your own place, of course, that's a little different.</p><p>GEORGE HOWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dodging power lines and low-hanging branches, we took a boat ride with Larry and Crystal Pesek, as emergency crews took them through what used to be their neighborhood.</p><p>CRYSTAL PESEK, FLOOD EVACUEE: This is the road that leads to our lane.</p><p>LARRY PESEK: I just can't believe the current in here -- the current is ripping.</p><p>HOWELL: After passing several homes.</p><p>CRYSTAL PESEK: Just down here on the left somewhere, I don't recognize anything now.</p><p>HOWELL: The reality of what's left became painfully apparent.</p><p>CRYSTAL PESEK: That's our house there.</p><p>HOWELL: The Peseks evacuated, but officials in Wakulla County say crews had to rescue dozens from their homes.</p><p>MAJOR MAURICE LANGSTON, WAKULLA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: The amount of rain we had, the water level came up so fast. Some of the folks didn't have time to actually pack their things and move out. So they're having to do it after that.</p><p>HOWELL: Across Florida, people are returning to their homes to find out what if anything is salvageable. Debby made landfall late Tuesday and is headed for the Atlantic.</p><p>But not before the storm jumps another 4 to 8 inches of rain on top of the 2 feet that's already fallen in some places. The water rose to the second floor in some homes.</p><p>But the Peseks are determined to start over. Though they can't help, but look back a little regretfully at all the hours they put into their house that they now have to rebuild.</p><p>LARRY PESEK: We're safe.</p><p>CRYSTAL PESEK: God will get us through it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COSTELLO: George Howell is live for us now. Your heart just goes out to those people.</p><p>HOWELL: Carol, you know, I just heard some news a few minutes ago from one official who said in this particular county, the rivers are still rising. We're also hearing about problems in Pasco County.</p><p>We know that at this point, at least 7,000 people, that's a new figure we just learned, 7,000 people have to evacuate. Also in nearby Hamilton County, they are dealing with the same issues.</p><p>These floodwaters rising from these fast-rising rivers, all the convergence of the floodwater from several different rivers coming together and then flushing out into the gulf.</p><p>COSTELLO: And you know, just to listen to the Peseks, they have to actually rebuild their entire house?</p><p>HOWELL: That will be a process. You know, first of all, they will have to wait, Carol, for all the floodwater to recede. Then there's always a concern about snakes, alligators, things like that. The things that get washed up, you know, when you have so much rainfall in such a short amount of time. So, you know, it could take a week, could take more for the waters to go away. Then that process will start -- start rebuilding.</p><p>COSTELLO: All right, George Howell reporting live for us. Thanks so much.</p><p>It's a chilling sign of the times and one sure to ripple through cash-strapped cities across the country. As early as today, Stockton, California will become the largest city in the country to declare bankruptcy. City council paved the way last night in a vote that infuriated city employees and homeowners.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have appointed you and we put our faith and trust in you. You have disappointed us and let us down. The world is watching. Thank God, so they can see we're victims of a society that's failing us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The decisions that you're making tonight are effectively throwing a grenade in my life and destroying everything that I've worked for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: Stockton is saddled with a crushing $26 million deficit. City officials say they'll continue to pay employees, vendors and service providers, but withhold payments on debt service.</p><p>Your congressman may be trading stock in the same companies lobbying their committees. We're talking about 130 members of Congress and more than $85 million in trades. But get this, none of that against the rules.</p><p>COSTELLO: It's 13 minutes past the hour. Checking the top stories now.</p><p>New details about the Trayvon Martin shooting. A police report reveals George Zimmerman passed a lie detector test the day after he shot and killed Martin. It also says Zimmerman had at least two opportunities to identify himself and defuse the situation.</p><p>Fire crews battling an inferno near Colorado Springs. A wildfire there has already chased 32,000 people from their homes and it's only about 5 percent contained. The fire also poses a danger to the Air Force Academy.</p><p>In money news, the IRS raked in more than $5 billion from tax cheats to its Voluntary Disclosure Program since 2009. So far, some 33,000 taxpayers have fessed up. The disclosure programs lure tax evaders by offering reduced penalties and the promise of avoiding jail time as long as the offenders reveal their off-shore bank accounts. Check out this video. Clearly, this man was over his head. The police in Brockton, Massachusetts say this man tried to break into a rent-a-center store. But as you can see, his head got wedged understand a metal door.</p><p>Manuel Hernandez is his name. He was actually stuck there for close to nine hours. Police say they plan to charge him with breaking and entering and malicious damage to property.</p><p>It might be outrageous, but it's not against any rules, 130 members of Congress or their families have traded stocks in companies while making the laws that directly affect those same companies.</p><p>According to a \"Washington Post\" report, 68 Democrats and 32 Republicans have taken part in this practice. In all, they have traded between $85 million and $218 million.</p><p>And these companies are registered to lobby on the legislation that appears before Congress, but the report doesn't show evidence of insider trading, nor does it show violations of the Stock Act, which was made to prevent this kind of thing.</p><p>Instead, the report highlights potential conflicts of interest, like Senator Kent Conrad whose wife made changes to her accounts the day after Conrad had a phone call with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Conrad made the extraordinary move of standing up for himself on the floor of the Senate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: To \"The Washington Post,\" I respect you. I've had a very good relationship with you for a long period of time. But your story was unfair to my family.</p><p>It was unfair to me. And fundamentally, it was unfair to your readers because the graphics you supplied with the story failed to provide a full or fair timeline.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: Kimberly Kindy is a reporter for \"The Washington Post.\" She worked on the analysis. Welcome.</p><p>KIMBERLY KINDY, REPORTER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Thank you for having me.</p><p>COSTELLO: So how does it feel to be smacked down on the floor of the Senate?</p><p>KINDY: Well, I think what the senator said, and I, you know, respect him taking time on the floor to defend himself. I mean, the bottom line is he said that there was nothing factually inaccurate with the story.</p><p>The problem that he had was that he wants the American people to trust that he did not have conversations with the Treasury secretary that provided him with critical information about the economy during the financial crisis.</p><p>That he then used, within two business days, to -- which was the standard that we looked at, to inform his own financial transactions.</p><p>I mean, really the point of the story is to point out that members of Congress do not allow the treasury secretary to do that. Treasury Secretary Paulson, what he was working on with members of Congress to come up with ways to deal with the financial crisis, working on legislation, et cetera.</p><p>They had pre-emptively said you cannot trade in financial stocks. You cannot trade in municipal bonds. You can't own treasury securities, notes and bills.</p><p>We pre-emptively prohibit you from doing that because if you're going to work on things that are going to restructure, fix, deal with the economy then that's going to be a conflict for you. But they do not prohibit that of themselves.</p><p>COSTELLO: But not a conflict for us, right? But Senator Conrad said -- I mean, he wasn't the one who called his financial people. It was his wife.</p><p>KINDY: Wight. Well, husbands and wives do speak to one another. So, I mean, the trouble with the existing laws and rules as they're written is do you have to trust members of Congress.</p><p>They said we don't think that's a good standard as the executive branch. We can't just merely trust you when you tell us, really, I didn't have confidential information that I acted on. They say, no, you need rules in place so you can't act. To take any question of it off, you know, off the table.</p><p>But they don't do it for themselves. If you're on the energy committee, you can actively trade in oil and gas companies. At the same time, you're writing legislation that would affect those companies. That applies for every committee.</p><p>COSTELLO: And they're lobbied by very powerful lobbyists, right?</p><p>KINDY: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>COSTELLO: But I remember, you know, this whole insider trading scandal and members of Congress and then they passed the Stock Act. And <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>celebrated that. Is that -- I mean, that doesn't apply to this? So is the Stock Act really that important?</p><p>KINDY: Well, you know, what it did was very limited and I'm not going to say that it wasn't important. I mean, our financial disclosure system, you find out they only disclose their trades -- there's all kinds of problems with the financial disclosure system.</p><p>But I'll limit it to one the thing they fixed. Instead of annually, we're going to get it every 45 days. So it's not realtime. Like another example of a double standard with Congress is that when the Enron scandal happened, they said that corporate officials had to publicly disclose their trades within two business days.</p><p>There was a member of Congress who tried to, with the original stock act, apply, get his fellow colleagues to pass the same rules for themselves, 48 hours. They fought it for six years.</p><p>And then finally under some pressure, they finally agreed to every 45 days. So it's not perfect. It's not realtime disclosure, but it's getting a little better.</p><p>It clarified something in the law, if you get information that's not public, non-public information on Capitol Hill, you can't trade on it and make -- and make a profit and it be legal now, if you're a member of Congress so all of those things that we wrote about, totally permitted, still.</p><p>COSTELLO: Yes, always a way around the law, especially when the lawmakers make the laws. Thank you very much, Kimberly Kindy. We appreciate it.</p><p>KINDY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>COSTELLO: Nora Ephron gave women a voice in Hollywood, often a funny one like in when \"Harry Met Sally.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes! Yes! Yes!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll have what she's having.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: I love that movie. Hollywood reacts to Nora Ephron's death.</p><p>COSTELLO: What better way to honor Nora Ephron than by revealing in her most delicious scenes one more time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes! Yes! Yes!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll have what she's having.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: That's from \"When Harry Met Sally.\" Of course, Nora Ephron received an Oscar for the screen play. As you know today, Hollywood is mourning her loss.</p><p>Entertainment correspondent, Nischelle Turner, has the reaction. So the big stars who worked with Ephron, what are they saying, Michelle? NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know what, all very positive, wonderful things about her, Carol, such an influential writer. She helped create so many unforgettable scenes in romantic comedies.</p><p>Many of Hollywood's biggest stars are remembering her and her impact on show business. Let's begin first with Billy Crystal who, of course, starred in \"When Harry Met Sally.\"</p><p>He said, \"I am very sad to learn of Nora's passing. She was a brilliant writer and humorist. Being her Harry to Meg's Sally will always have a special place if my heart. I was very lucky to get to say her words.\"</p><p>And Tom Hanks starred in two Ephron movies, \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"You've Got Mail.\" And Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson released the following statement to CNN.</p><p>They said, \"Nora Ephron was a journalist, artist, who knew what was important to know. How things really worked, what was worthwhile. Who was fascinating and why. At a dinner table and on a film set, she lifted us all with wisdom and wit, mixed with love for us and love for life. Rita and I are so very sad to lose our friend who brought so much joy to all who are lucky enough to know to her.\"</p><p>She was a truly iconic writer, Carol, and yes, we loved her movies, but I think I really loved her op-ed pieces in \"The New York Times\" and \"Huffington Post.\" She was such a great, witty writer.</p><p>COSTELLO: She was working right up to the end. She will be truly missed. All right, let's go from really classy to really not.</p><p>TURNER: Yes.</p><p>COSTELLO: And the drink brawl -- what's new?</p><p>TURNER: You know, that's a darn good way to put it. Yes, we're kind of hitting you with some hilarity at the end of that good stuff there. Chris Brown versus <person><nameText>Drake, </nameText></person>the rematch, that's what we're talking about.</p><p>Get this, a celebrity boxing promoter is looking to capitalize on that alleged New York night club fight between the two and their entourages by offering them $1 million each to duke it out in the ring.</p><p>And Carol, the promoter, Damon Feldman wants Rihanna to be the ring girl at the match. I swear, I'm not making this up. Yes, Feldman says he hasn't heard from Brown. He hasn't heard from <person><nameText>Drake.</nameText></person></p><p>But he's 99.9 percent sure that Rihanna will pass. He's put on celebrity boxing matches before for ex-baseball star, Jose Canseco and also Lindsay Lohan's dad, Michael.</p><p>So who knows? It could happen. Now the one redeeming factor in this whole thing they say any proceeds from this boxing match would go to battered women's charities. So that could be something --</p><p>COSTELLO: That's disgusting, though. Come on.</p><p>TURNER: Well -- listen, if it helps give some money and some awareness to abuse to which Chris Brown has been so famously involved with Rihanna, but maybe that could be redeeming.</p><p>COSTELLO: I'll try to ignore the whole hypocrisy of that, but it's hard. Nischelle Turner, thank you so much.</p><p>Need your entertainment fix, A.J. Hammer and the \"SHOWBIZ TONIGHT\" team, we've got you covered at 11 p.m. Eastern on HLN.</p><p>The high court takes up the issue of health care. We will break doubt the Supreme Court's possible ruling and what it means for your health.</p><p>COSTELLO: Just about 30 minutes past the hour. Checking our top stories now.</p><p>The countdown under way for tomorrow's Supreme Court decision on Obama care. The justices looking at several aspects of health care reform laws, including the requirement that nearly everyone buy health insurance. The court will decide if that part of the law is constitutional.</p><p>In Colorado, at least ten wildfires are burning, including this one north of Colorado Springs. It's not known how many homes have been lost to the Waldo Canyon fire, but it has forced the evacuation of at least 32,000 people. Flames are now getting close to the Air Force Academy campus.</p><p>Across much of Florida, the rains have stopped, but the floodwaters aren't going anywhere. Debby is now a tropical depression, but only after dumping nearly two feet of rain in some areas. Some towns still knee deep in water.</p><p>As we've been telling you, tomorrow is a critical day for both the future of health care and for the Obama administration. As the Supreme Court is set to issue a history-making decision on the President's health care law. The justices could rule in a number of ways, including upholding the entire law or striking it down.</p><p>The court could also rule that parts but not all of the law violate the Constitution. Moments ago, Republican House Speaker John Boehner had this to say about the Supreme Court's ruling and what might happen after it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE SPEAKER: We made it pretty clear, and I'll make it clear one more time. If -- if the court does not strike down the entire law, the House will move to repeal what's left of it. Obama care is driving up the cost of health care and making it harder for small businesses to hire new workers.</p><p>Our focus has been the economy and it will continue to be the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COSTELLO: The impact of the Supreme Court's ruling will reach far beyond Washington.</p><p>Here to talk about what's on the line for you is our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. He's also a practicing neurosurgeon at a public hospital in Atlanta. And he worked in the White House during the Clinton administration. Good morning, Sanjay.</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: So if the entire law is thrown out, will anyone notice? Because most of it hasn't been -- you know, won't go into effect until 2014.</p><p>GUPTA: No, it's a good point. I think the immediate impact will be probably pretty minimal. And -- and by the way, a lot of the big insurance companies, we've been talking to some of them to sort of get an idea of what they would do under the different scenarios that you just presented. There's a chance that a lot of the insurance companies may say, look, the entire law was not implemented but what's been implemented so far we're going to keep. Some of the health insurance companies may just decide to do that on their own, but they don't have to. It's not going to be the law, obviously, if this is -- if this is overturned.</p><p>So, you know, it's a little bit of a -- of a question mark right now, Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: Oh, so many question marks. There is a chance the Supreme Court could throw out the individual mandate, you know, the requirement that almost all of us buy health insurance? And also throw out the ban of pre-existing conditions so insurance companies wouldn't be forced to accept everybody.</p><p>So if that scenario happens what key provisions would be left?</p><p>GUPTA: Well, that's a good question. And that is a -- that is a quite a likely scenario, the one that you just described, if they throw out the mandate, then the -- the -- this -- this ban on discriminating for -- for pre-existing conditions may go out with it as well.</p><p>But keep in mind, Carol -- and there's some 450 provisions to this bill. So there's lots of other things, potentially. Let me tick off a few of them that I think are quite important in terms of what might remain. And again this is based on some of our discussions, our reporting with the insurance companies. If you have insurance and you become sick, you can't be dropped. Right now, you could be dropped by your insurance company. No lifetime limits. Carol I tell you as a doctor that's a big one, because when people get sick, they can get to that lifetime limit very quickly.</p><p>Co-pays on preventative care, this is something that's been discussed a lot but the idea that people should be getting preventative care but they don't just because of the co-pays or additional costs.</p><p>And then the employers having to provide insurance, Representative Boehner was just talking about that.</p><p>The last one is a big one. I hear about this so much from people, especially in that age range, who say, I've finished school, I've gotten out of school. And I can stay on my plans -- parents' plan until age 26. That could remain as well.</p><p>Also incidentally, Carol, it makes small businesses much more likely to hire people in that age range because they already have health insurance that those businesses don't have to provide that health insurance for them.</p><p>COSTELLO: Ok so here's a question, we all do a good job of blaming the government or hospitals or insurance companies for the high cost of health care. What do Americans think? Are there any polls out there that show that?</p><p>GUPTA: In terms of what they think about this plan, you're saying?</p><p>COSTELLO: On who's to blame for the high cost of health insurance, health care costs, I should say?</p><p>GUPTA: Well, you know I mean, I think in part, we're to blame, meaning the citizens of the country. You know, I'll preface by saying, look, if you look across the world, Carol, no one does a terrific job at controlling health care costs. I mean, all countries, regardless of the types of insurance plans they have, health care costs have been going up.</p><p>But clearly, I think to your point, in the United States, it's -- it's been really out of sorts. I think in part, you know, consumers, if you look at us as a whole, we're very overweight or obese, for example. Close to three quarters of adults, 68 percent roughly are either overweight or obese. One in five people smoke. You know and that's -- that's -- these are -- these are both things that can lead to increased health care costs, just personal responsibility.</p><p>But let me make a larger point, and I think an important one, Carol. And that is that health assurance alone, health insurance alone does not lead to good health. You and I both know plenty of people who have terrific health care insurance but aren't in terrific health. And part of it is because they don't do a lot of things that we talk about. They don't go see their doctor, they don't get the preventive services despite the fact they have very good health insurance. So this is part of the equation.</p><p>Take a look, only half of Americans got preventative care services prior to 2010.</p><p>COSTELLO: And you know I never -- I'm one of them. I never do that because I'm in such great health and I'm like oh I don't want to take the time. But you're right.</p><p>GUPTA: Yes, well you know and this is part of it, you know 85 percent of the country has health insurance. That's the other side of this equation. But a significant percentage of them do not see their doctors. Do not take adequately good care of themselves; do not get those preventive services so there is a second beat to this story, Carol, which we're going to keep doing.</p><p>COSTELLO: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, thanks so much.</p><p>GUPTA: You got it, Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: As we wait to see how the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the health care law backed by <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Mississippi is one of the 26 states fighting it. Even so, Mississippi is moving ahead with another provision of Obama care. That is, building an online insurance exchange.</p><p>Joining me now is the state's insurance commissioner Mike Chaney. Welcome, welcome Mr. Chaney.</p><p>MIKE CHANEY, COMMISSIONER, MISSISSIPPI INSURANCE: Thank you Carol, good morning to you.</p><p>COSTELLO: Good morning, first of all, explain what these exchanges are for our viewers?</p><p>CHANEY: Well, essentially an exchange is a market place for an individual or small employee use about health insurance for their employees or themselves individually. Mississippi has looked at exchanges for the last four years, actually since Massachusetts passed their exchange. And it came out at the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>You know an exchange is not a Democrat or Republican idea. It's a universal idea. It's way to market insurance to reduce the costs and give our consumer's options.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COSTELLO: Yes, I was just going to ask you, Mike, how exactly does this make insurance cheaper for those who can't afford health care?</p><p>CHANEY: It gives -- it gives the consumer a lot of choices, Carol that they do not have today. There's no guarantee that that insurance will be cheaper on an exchange. It's a marketplace, it's a paradigm shift from what we've been accustomed to in the past. Exchanges where -- as I said a universal idea, it's something that came about before the Affordable Care Act was actually passed. COSTELLO: So are you accepting federal money out of the Obama care provisions to set up these exchanges in Mississippi?</p><p>CHANEY: We're taking the federal money to set up exchanges in Mississippi. Our goal is to have an exchange that will comply to federal law, so if the court upholds the Affordable Care Act. If the court does not uphold the Affordable Care Act, our goal then is to have an exchange that will be a pre-market based exchange to be able to market different types of insurance, health insurance products on the marketplace for consumers, and for our small employers.</p><p>And to that end we already have several companies lined up to market products on the exchange. We have a portal up and running it's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.onemississippi.com\">www.onemississippi.com</url>. It's o-n-e -- you spell out m-i-s-s-i-s-s-i- p-p-i.com. So you can got look at it if you want to consumers can, too.</p><p>COSTELLO: And then a final question, you're Republican, but you said that the exchanges are not a Democratic or Republican idea. But the whole health care law, Obama care as Republicans call it derisively, I might add.</p><p>In your opinion, is Obama care a good law or bad law? And what should the U.S. Supreme Court do since you're already implementing some of what's in Obama care?</p><p>CHANEY: Well, let me answer that two ways, Carol. One, I didn't have a vote on Obama care. Or as you all call it, I call it the Affordable Care Act which is the proper name. But if I had a vote, I would have voted against the law very simply. There are a lot of parts of that law that should not be included in statutory law. And I think that puts the court in a precarious situation of trying to rule on -- on constitutionality of individual mandates, our tier one on Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>It presents a host of problems for the court to try to rule. Nobody knows what the court is going to do. I have no clue as to what they will do. If you look at the second mandate that that -- that General Washington put out when he conscripted people into the Army, the individual mandate that you would supply ammunition and -- and guns and all the military things that you needed, the courts could argue that's what we're doing here.</p><p>I don't know what's going to happen. I don't think anybody does except the justices themselves.</p><p>COSTELLO: But I expect you will be watching with great interest tomorrow.</p><p>CHANEY: I'll be watching big time because it affects us, we've taken -- we've taken over $20 million of federal money to set up our exchanges here in the state of Mississippi. We've been very upfront saying, we're going to take the money, set it up, without using state dollars if we can. We hope the exchange, and we believe the exchange can operate without any state money or federal money being involved if it's free market. And that's our goal. You know I had great support from Haley Barbour. Three years ago, I served in the legislature when Haley had his first term. So I understand his thought process. I've known Haley for as almost 50 years. So we -- we think alike. We believe in free market solutions to complex problems.</p><p>So that's -- that's our approach to this -- this problem. It's an insurance problem. It's ironic that I, as a commissioner and dealing with health care benefits when I'm usually a regulator. But I enjoy it. It's a challenge for us and I'm up for the challenge.</p><p>COSTELLO: You are. And thank you so much for being with us and explaining this to us.</p><p>CHANEY: Thank you Carol. Thank you.</p><p>COSTELLO: It's just so fascinating. Thank you, Mr. Chaney.</p><p>What gadgets can we expect from Google? Maybe a tablet? We'll have a live report from Google's Developers Conference. Yes, that's going on in San Francisco. And interesting things are coming out of it. We'll tell you.</p><p>COSTELLO: In just the last 30 minutes, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said the House will go forward with a contempt vote against <person><nameText>Attorney General Eric Holder. </nameText></person>Boehner claims Holder is withholding documents relating to the government's botched gun sting \"Fast and Furious\". Joe Johns was at the Speaker's news conference. He joins us from Capitol Hill to tell us what Mr. Boehner said. Hi, Joe.</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Carol, as you know, generally, when you have things like this that come to a head they get negotiated out before you get to the final conclusion which would be in this case a vote for contempt on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p><p>There have been behind the scenes talking as recently as last night, but clearly, no solutions have been reached. The Speaker of the House just a little while ago talking in the basement of the United States Capitol, saying he does now still plan to proceed with that vote of contempt against Attorney General Holder. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Brian Terry's family has a right to know what happened. The American people have a right to know what happened. And we're going to proceed.</p><p>We've given them ample opportunity to comply, even as late as yesterday. The White House sat down with some of our staff that outlined what they'd be willing to do. Unfortunately, they're not willing to show the American people the truth about what happened. It's an unfortunate -- it's an unfortunate place where we are. But our members raised their right hand and swear to uphold the constitution of the United States and the laws of the United States. We're going to do our job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS: Of course, the back story here is about the National Rifle Association, a very powerful lobby here in Washington, D.C. They are counting this vote, they tell me, which means there will be very likely be some Democrats who will very seriously consider voting against Attorney General in order to preserve their NRA rating.</p><p>I talked to the National Rifle Association just a little while ago. They tell me they have actually heard from some Democrats in NRA supporting districts, who say they will be voting against Attorney General Holder.</p><p>So why is the NRA doing this? Well, they say, they believe the \"Fast and Furious\" operation which is at the root of all of this actually was a part of a larger gun control strategy, if you will, which is something the NRA is very much against.</p><p>I asked Speaker Boehner if there was evidence of that. He said he never said that in the first place. So that's something that's sort of coming out of the oversight reform committee. We're asking around the hill, Carol, for the evidence of a larger gun control strategy in the \"Fast and Furious\" operation.</p><p>COSTELLO: Well, you know Joe, Democrats call it a conspiracy theory. And Republicans -- some Republicans say that that's why the government isn't turning over those doubts, because the Obama administration is secretly creating this gun control thing. And these documents will show that what's what \"Fast and Furious\" was really about.</p><p>JOHNS: Absolutely. And there's also some suggestion that the chairman of the oversight committee over on the house side Darrell Issa has actually said he has gotten ahold of an e-mail or two that seemed to point in that direction. And we'd like to see that e-mail ourselves.</p><p>COSTELLO: Yes, we would, wouldn't we? Joe Johns, you work on that.</p><p>JOHNS: Thanks, Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: Thank you so much.</p><p>Big shift for Apple. Apple now changing its tune when it comes to how safe Apple computers are. As in viruses? Maybe Apple is not so immune after all.</p><p>COSTELLO: Apple now admitting it's not exactly immune to viruses these days. Alison Kosik is at the New York Stock Exchange. This is disturbing, Alison. ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's disturbing, but it's not really that surprising. I mean think about what Apple is like. When it announces a new product, it's not shy about it. It kinds of puffs up its feathers and makes its big new announcements. Here's what's curious. The company was pretty darned quiet about not being so ironclad with its security.</p><p>You know how a lot of people learned about this? Through a blog called Naked Security, that was first to notice this. So, if you actually go to Apple's Web site and you look on the \"Why you love a Mac\" page, the language used to be it doesn't get PC viruses. Well, guess what? It's changed. It now says \"It's built to be safe.\"</p><p>What happened here is a big Trojan virus infected more than 500,000 MACs back in April. Now Apple has always bragged about how much safer its operating system is compared to Windows. But you know what; with more and more people buying MACs, the odds of getting a virus naturally go up. So Apple has to put its pride to the side.</p><p>Experts point out though regardless of whatever operating system you have Carol, you -- not you, but meaning the user -- are the biggest risks. You always have to keep your security programs up to date. And that all means don't download anything you don't -- like you know those attachments, don't just download anything that comes your way.</p><p>COSTELLO: I know. I learned my lesson the hard way. Alison Kosik, thank you so much.</p><p>KOSIK: Sure.</p><p>COSTELLO: What's coming up from Google? Will it enter the tablet market? We're about to find out with the tech giant kicking off its annual developers conference today. CNN's Dan Simon is front and center in San Francisco. Hi, Dan.</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi Carol. Well, we all remember when the titanic battle in technology was between Google and Microsoft. Well, today's battle is between -- I'm sorry, it was between Apple and Microsoft. Today's battle is between Google and Apple -- iPhone versus Android. Now we're looking at Google's I/O Conference, I/O stands for input and output. And you've got thousands of developers from all over the world coming to downtown San Francisco to see the latest Android products.</p><p>At this point, Carol, you really have to say it's advantage Google, right now, when it comes to Smartphone market share. Google now has about 62 percent of the global market share. So we'll see what Google has up its sleeve in about two hours from now -- Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: What about that tablet?</p><p>SIMON: Well, it's interesting, you know, most of the tablets that have been released have been flops with the exception of Apple's iPad. So Google expected to introduce its own tablet today. We believe it's going to be about seven inches, smaller than the iPad, retailing for about $200. And this is really sort of to blunt what Microsoft came out with last week with its Surface and also Amazon's Kindle Fire.</p><p>We'll see how the tablet does. It should enter the market pretty soon. And of course, anytime Google unveils a product, it's a big deal. And this is their first tablet -- Carol.</p><p>COSTELLO: Can't wait to see it. Dan Simon reporting live from San Francisco.</p><p>What is an Olympic no-no? A woman in a bikini or a man in a Speedo? If you ask one Olympic swimmer, the answer is painfully clear.</p><p>COSTELLO: An update now on Karen Klein, the grandmotherly bus monitor who was tormented by a group of middle schoolers. After the video of that went viral, donations poured in and look at that. Karen Klein has met the man who helped raise more than $500,000 for her to take a vacation.</p><p>Max Sidorov came all the way from Toronto to Greece, New York. He said he never expected to raise so much money. His initial goal was just $5,000 and so far the total is over $660,000. Klein has said she may invest some of the money and also donate some of it.</p><p>Also, this morning, the Olympic rings are now on London's iconic Tower Bridge. It marks the final countdown to the opening ceremony just 30 days away. The rings are showing up all over London as the city prepares for the games which you better hurry if you want to go. The BBC is reporting 80 percent of the tickets have been sold.</p><p>Finally this hour, what's with Australia? Land of Wolverine Hugh Jackman, vicious dingos and naughty Olympians.</p><p>Take Olympic swimmer, Stephanie Rice. She tweeted a picture of herself in a swimsuit -- here it is. Australia is not happy. According to Yahoo! Sports this is a no-no, too skimpy, not dignified. Have Australians ever seen photos of Michael Phelps in a Speedo? Let's see that Speedo. Or America's newest sensation Ryan Lochte?</p><p>I'm sure Australian men bare most of their bodies too except of course when they're posing with a couple of pump-action shotguns. Australia wasn't happy with that, either, even though Nick Darcy and Kendrick Monk were at a shooting range. What could be worse? A naked Australian wielding weapons embedded in his hands?</p><p>That would have been so much better with the sound. Anyway, the lesson here -- I'll leave that to you.</p><p>And I'll say good afternoon, and thanks for joining me today. I'm Carol Costello.</p><p>CNN NEWSROOM with Kyra Phillips continues after a quick break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2012062702CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5609-NW31-JC11-90WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 27, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Joining me, former State  Department Spokesperson, Spokesman, Host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on Fox News  Radio, Marie Harf.  I was listening to it yesterday.  </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Woo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner Mike Murphy.  And Forbes  Media Chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate, the incomparable  Steve Forbes.  As I tweeted last night Steve, great of you to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be with you.  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again --</p><p>FORBES:  Great way to begin the day with that description.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great way to begin the day with you three smarties here.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up this morning also, Health and Human Services Secretary  Alex Azar is here.  Former Republican Presidential Candidate Herman Cain.   Vista Global Chairman and Founder Thomas Flor.  You don't want to miss any  of the guests coming up in the next three hours.</p><p>To our top story, Supreme Court showdown, Senate Judiciary Committee  Chairman Chuck Grassley setting a deadline of tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for a  response from Brett Kavanaugh's accuser amid a back and forth battle on  whether or not she will testify on Monday.</p><p>Christine Blasey-Ford is alleging that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her  more than 30 -- about 35 years ago.  Grassley also demanding an unredacted  copy of a letter the Ford sent to the Committee's ranking democrats Senator  Dianne Feinstein regarding the alleged incident dated July 30th.</p><p>President Trump eager to hear from Ford saying, \"It would be 'unfortunate'\"  if she does not testify.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say this, I think he's an extraordinary man, I think he's a  man of great intellect as I've been telling you, and he's had an  unblemished record.  This is a very tough thing for him and his family.   And we want to get it over with, at the same time we want to give  tremendous amounts of time.  If she shows up, that would be wonderful, if  she doesn't show up, that would be unfortunate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve, how do you think this plays out?</p><p>FORBES:  I thought the president in that -- just that little clip you had  handle it just right.  She should take that opportunity to testify, let the  Committee decide, let the American public decide instead of doing it  through leaks or trying to do it through having setting conditions and  things like that.</p><p>But the fact is that she's equivocating, it's not a good thing for the dems  but she should just testify -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you --</p><p>FORBES:  -- and let -- and let the Committee decide.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you make of how Senator Chuck Grassley has handled this?   Because the republicans on the Committee led by Grassley, they have really  tried to make -- they -- they've said, \"We will -- we will listen to Ford  at a time and place convenient to her.\"  They've even offered to send  individuals from the Committee out to wherever she wants to meet them.</p><p>That it isn't that -- and they were -- and they pushback on this, Grassley  did a couple of days ago, you have to sit next to Brett Kavanaugh and face  -- and this accuser has to face this man head-on.  That's not what they're  talking about.  They've really tried their best to make -- get her to talk  to them.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  They know that obviously these are very, very serious  allegations and therefore it's got to be treated with utmost seriousness  and so they're going out of their way.</p><p>Create an environment where she can talk about it if she wishes to do so,  make the accuser in public if she wishes to do so, half the members of the  Committee will be very sympathetic and so she'll have support there.  </p><p>So they're doing everything to make it -- put it out in the public, make  your statement, let the Committee and the public decide.  And so I think  Senator Grassley has been such a vivid contrast to some other members of  that Committee that most Americans are going to say, she made an  accusation, go out, do it in public and let's see what happens next.  The  president, I thought that statement was just right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He might -- I -- we have been watching Senator Hirono from  Hawaii and she has certainly gone overboard screaming, literally yelling  about all men need to shut up and step up.  Even I think she used an  exploitive when she was talking to \"ABC\" yesterday.</p><p>So we understand she's upset but that doesn't really solve this issue for  the republicans and for the democrats.  </p><p>HARF:  Right.  The goal should be to get whatever truth you can get after  35 years for the Senate to consider this new allegation as part of its  advice and consent on this nominee.  She should -- I think that Dr. Ford  should testify in some way whether it's publicly or privately.</p><p>But the political reality, Dagen, I think is that if there are no other  accusations, if there are no people out there saying this is a pattern, if  there are no other women just from a political standpoint, I think she will  get to give her side of the story, Judge Kavanaugh will also get to and my  sense is, as long as that just basically turns into a he said she said in  front of the Committee, Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  That's my  political sense right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will you admit that this demand that -- and this is not just  from the accuser and her lawyers, this is kind of a narrative from the  democrats on the Committee and even outside of the Committee that the FBI  must investigate this.</p><p>The FBI is not -- is -- they're not responsible for a -- basically  investigating and being political judges, making determinations as they  would in a criminal case.  They're responsible as they were in the Anita  Hill case initially when the accusations was still private.  </p><p>They interviewed the parties involved and in a couple of days -- in just a  few days and then handed that off to the Committee and then once those  allegations about Clarence Thomas became public, it was handled b the  Committee, not the FBI.</p><p>HARF:  So I think two things, I do think there are other people that she  alleged that were involved that should actually also testify before the  Committee.  Mark Judge, this other man that she alleges was part of the  situation, he spoken publicly, they want the truth, he should also testify  before the Committee.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He issued a statement.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>HARF:  But I think the F -- what the FBI can do, they issue background  checks.  And whenever you have a clearance or some sort of background  check, if new information comes to light, they look at it, they evaluate it  and they see whether it has bearing on that person's background check.</p><p>I think the FBI could do that.  And I don't think that would be  unreasonable.  If we want to get the truth and we want to check every box  to make sure we're taking this seriously, I don't know why that can't be  done at the same time.  The Committee is moving forward, it seems  reasonable to me.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  It's very -- a very serious allegation obviously.  But it's  unfortunate that it became a political grandstanding event, that it was  held back that this information wasn't brought to the public until this  time right before a vote was due to come.</p><p>So I think that in it of itself just takes down the seriousness of it a  little bit.  If this -- if there's an allegation of sexual assault that  you're holding on to, you should bring that out, you shouldn't wait until a  final minute to kind of gain some political points for it I think </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well the reason that so many people on the right and republicans  are upset Steve is because it's very obvious based on the democrats and  Senator Feinstein sitting on this allegation for some weeks, it's a  political ambush. </p><p>It's political chicanery. The goal is to definitely delay the -- this vote  until after the midterm elections and I just -- that's the big question is,  how does this -- how does this impact the democrats?  How does it impact  the republicans between now and when people go to vote?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, that's why she should testify, Dr. Ford should testify on  Monday so people can see it and you have the accuser, you have the defender  and make their statements.  But politically, I think the democrats sort of  know Kavanaugh, Judge Kavanaugh will probably be confirmed.</p><p>But what they're going to try to do is say, \"You see, they're republicans,  they're misogynist, they don't care about women, this is just one more  incident, just suppress republican suburban turnout.\"  And --</p><p>HARF:  And the last time this happened with Anita Hill and with the next  election, 1992, a record number f women came out to vote, it was the year  of the women when a bunch of women got elected and one of the major driving  factors in that election was the Anita Hill hearing.  But just politically  what you're saying Steve --</p><p>FORBES:  And that's why -- and that's why the president --</p><p>HARF:  This is a calculation.</p><p>FORBES:  -- I think is so calm yesterday.  From the beginning he said  they're allegations, she should have every opportunity to bring them out  there and have a fair hearing.  Not the usual punch back, they all know  they got to be very careful with this, so give her every opportunity to get  her story out that's why it's essential.</p><p>And I think that Senator Grassley is right, give her the opportunity on  Monday in a -- in a proper setting, so it's not adversarial as they  sometimes try to do and have it out there.  And if she does not take that  opportunity, that speaks wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chuck Grassley has said public or private we will send  individuals to you in California if that's what it takes for people on this  Committee to talk to you.  I just think a lot of women see this big blue  bumper sticker out the midterms, \"Men are liars.\"</p><p>That commanding the conversation are people like Senator Hirono but even  Joy Behar who came out yesterday and said, \"Oh, white man protecting a man\"  and she asserted that Kavanaugh is probably guilty and I -- that's what  gets a lot of the attention in this country, not the kind of reasonable  treatment of an accuser in a Supreme Court nominee but, again, the people  who are yelling the loudest who have the biggest megaphone.  </p><p>HARF:  Yes.  And I think a lot -- a lot will depend on how this hearing  goes if it happens because there are a lot of women, suburban women,  independents who will help decide this election that want to see if the  republicans will treat her with respect, right?</p><p>And so far we have -- you know, everything, it's been better than the Anita  Hill situation but that's not a high bar.  So, I think that we will be  watching very closely to see how this place out.  And some -- there have  been some hysterical comments on the republican side as well.  So we will - - these next few days are going to be weird.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No yelling, no hysteria here.</p><p>HARF:  Exactly.  We're all calm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And we take you back down South, Florence's fallout,  President Trump making stops in North and South Carolina touring areas most  affected by this horrific storm.  This comes as we're learning that the  flooding cleanup could last years.  Griff Jenkins, FOX News Correspondent  is live in Fayetteville, North Carolina with more.  Good morning Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Dagen.  Yes.   Fayetteville would like to start getting back on its feet but it could be  days or weeks because of the water.  </p><p>The main bridge downtown behind me closed for structural integrity and  that's because the Cape Fear River, pressed at a record 61.5 feet  yesterday.  You look at this drone video shot by Councilman Jim Arp, the  Fayetteville City Council, it's just amazing the flooding going on there.</p><p>We had a chance to speak with the mayor here, Mitch Colevin for a while  yesterday and he told us what he hopes the president and the administration  will do in terms of getting them resources, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCH COLEVIN (D), FAYETTEVILLE CITY MAYOR:  If I ever get an opportunity  to speak to the administration and the people in the White House, I want to  tell him that that is something that I'm very concerned with as the small  businesses getting back up and running.  Two years ago when we have  Matthew, you know, FEMA was here in -- very quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  Fayetteville was spared a little bit of beating perhaps because  30 miles south, the rain Dagen, even double, 36 inches there, about 15 here  in the city.  But as President Trump toured areas, he didn't come here but  as he toured all the areas he assured everyone in the storm he had their  backs in mayors just like Mayor Colevin, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're getting all teed up for a lot of money to come down to the  area, they're going to need it and we have it and we will be supplying it.   And there will be nothing left undone, you'll have everything you need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  In the flooding south of here also still a major issue, Highway  95 closer to Lumberton still shutdown in some areas, so it is indeed going  to be days if not weeks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Griff, we appreciate you being there very much.  Griff Jenkins  because I -- you were in that storm and you've -- and you've stayed to  cover the aftermath because it matters.  Thank you so much Griff.</p><p>We'll be speaking with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on the  health effects following these catastrophic floods at 8:30 a.m. Eastern  Time.  </p><p>Comng up, Alibaba backtracking, why Jack Ma is now walking back his promise  to create one million jobs in the U.S.</p><p>Plus, one soggy commute, the New York City flood rat, he's taking  (INAUDIBLE) the internet by storm this morning, more of this video for you  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Four police officers on both sides of this country shot in the  line of duty.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen, good morning.  All  right.  To Los Angeles, two deputies were in the hospital this morning  while following a chase and a shootout there.  The suspects opened fire as  the deputies were responding to a call about a man flashing a gun near  park.</p><p>Both deputies shot in the upper body, they're in stable condition luckily,  one suspect was killed, two others are in custody.  Then to Maryland, two  officers were shot while serving a drug-related search warrant.  The  unidentified cops flown to a trauma center after being hit in the hand and  shoulder.  They are expected to survive, the suspect is in jail.  Thirty  seven police officers have been shot and killed in the line of duty so far  this year.</p><p>Well, as the trade fight between Washington and Beijing intensifies,  Alibaba Founder and Chairman Jack Ma is now walking back his 2017 promise  to create one million jobs in United States.  </p><p>Ma says, \"This promise was on the basis of friendly China-U.S. cooperation  and reasonable bilateral trade relations that the current situation is  already destroyed that basis.  Earlier this week Ma said the trade war  between the two countries could last for two decades.  </p><p>Well, European Union Antitrust officials are reporting looking into  Amazon's treatment of other merchants that sell products using its  platform.  Investigators want to know if Amazon is gaining a competitive  advantage by using data from every transaction and from every merchant that  sells on Amazon.  There is no comment yet from Amazon on the investigation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon is reportedly considering opening as many as 3,000 Amazon  Go cashierless stores over the next three years.  Currently, there are just  three Amazon Go locations in Seattle, there's one in Chicago.  Shoppers use  their Amazon Go app and instead of dealing with a cashier, cameras and  sensors keep track of what they buy.  The accounts are automatically  charged for whatever products they carry out.</p><p>Shares of Amazon are up 66 percent so far this year Dagen.  And we should  add they're going to be opening one up right here in New York City and some  of us can't wait, we're very excited about that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is going to be a disaster.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh yes.  No, I'm excited about it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Shoplifters are going to need to find a new job.  You can't  shoplift.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Anyone who --</p><p>HARF:  They'll find a way.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- wants to grab something can't do it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People -- there are going to be so many problems.  The CVS  across the street in my apartment has the -- you have to check yourself  out.  That is a nightmare.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's a disaster.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have -- that is a total disaster.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know why Amazon thinks it can leapfrog even over that.   They can't get those things to work.  They have more people.  If they just  get rid of the machines and hire people to run the registers, it would be  more helpful than having all these additional people to help the people who  are self-checking out.</p><p>FORBES:  It's still the same thing at the airport, they always have to have  somebody there by the machine because it often doesn't work.  But this is  just rudimentary, eventually they'll get that technology right.</p><p>MURPHY:  They will.  They're getting it right.  But also by using the  technology, they get all your data.  So if it was a cashier, they wouldn't  know who you are, what you do but by using technology they can track you on  what you're doing and what you have took.</p><p>HARF:  I like real people.  I like -- I'm old school, I like talking to  people.  </p><p>MURPHY:  That is old school.  </p><p>HARF:  I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, in terms of data, that's why Amazon is really  pushing this Whole Foods discount if you're a Prime member.</p><p>HARF:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They -- every box you get from them, the actual tape on the box  is shopping it.  They have people in the stores, every cashier at Whole  Foods is trying to push it because it wants your data.</p><p>MURPHY:  And this is bad for obesity.  It's one thing to be before a person  and order five cheeseburgers, quite another one and just punch it in, no  one's going to give you a bad look.  </p><p>HARF:  True.  Great point.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Has this happen to you Steve?  You want to tell us something?</p><p>FORBES:  Well no.  No, no, no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, it's pepperoni pizza day, so we are going to have  some pepperoni pizza for you coming up.</p><p>CASONE:  Woo-hoo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheryl just went woo-hoo.</p><p>Coming up, also bumping up baggage fees, Delta joining United and JetBlue  in raising its check bag fee, we'll tell you how much.  </p><p>Plus, survey says the best and worst airports in the country according to  travelers.  We have the results ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We are watching markets this morning, the Dow and S&amp;P500 both  less than one percent from their all-time highs and Futures are up across  the board, 24-point gain on the Dow Futures right now.</p><p>And we're seeing it, there's been a selloff in Treasury's yield on the 10- year hovering above that three percent market, that's a four month high.   Joining us now is Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust Fixed Income Strategist,  Matt Diczok. </p><p>Matt, what do you make of this about finally we're getting a little bit of  a steepening of the yield curve where there's longer term interest rates  have gone up.  Is that a positive sign because people always talk about the  inversion of it where shorter term rates are higher.   Is a sign of economic weakness ahead?</p><p>MATT DICZOK, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, MERRILL LYNCH &amp; U.S. ANTITRUST:  Yes.   Though it is a positive sign that long-term rates are moving up slightly,  what that tells you is the market is basically onboard with what the Fed's  policy is going to be for the next couple of meetings.</p><p>So the Fed said they're going to hike probably September, probably  December.  The Fed's forecasting three hikes next year, the market's a  little bit less optimistic.  The markets agreed with the Fed for the next  couple of hikes.  It was a little bit unclear next year.  They had about  one hike but now as the rates move up, the market is saying more and more  they're comfortable with the Fed's policy as long as the 10-year rate  because needs to move up in this range, we think we're in a good place  right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  I was surprised that the market overreacted the first time we came  up near three percent yield on the 10-year, market sold off.  But now I  think the market understands that if the rates are rising for the reason  reasons, it's OK.</p><p>So if we get three rate hikes next year, I think as long as its supported  by an improving economy the market can continue to go quite a bit higher.</p><p>DICZOK:  I think that's absolutely right.  So as Dagen mentioned that  flattening of the yield curve, right, two-tenth has come down to about 20  base points of so, that concern a lot investors.  But we don't think it  should be a concern for investors.</p><p>Now the point thing to look at is a three month to ten years or Fed funds  the two-year spread.  Right now it's about 90 basis points between the Fed  funds or in a two-year rate.  That tells you the market thinks that another  two to three hikes from the Fed is OK, they're not concerned about it which  would be concerned about would be an inversion, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>DICZOK:  Ten-year substantially below two-year rate for an extended period  of time or two-year rates below the Fed funds rate.  An inversion would  tell you that the market thinks the Fed is too restricted in going to make  a mistake, we're not close to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's overshooting is going to whack the economy, even send the  economy under a recession because people are buying those longer term bonds  as a -- as protection if there's an economic downturn.  </p><p>FORBES:  Are you surprised that the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope I got that right.</p><p>DICZOK:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Before 6:30 in the morning.</p><p>DICZOK:  We don't -- we don't think -- in can be the kind of growth doesn't  dive because of old age, right?  It dies because of a Fed induced recession  will try to get inflation down.</p><p>FORBES:  Were you surprised by the reception of that $15 billion bond deal  from Thompson Reuters, all these junk bonds, c-rate, CC, they gobbled --  markets gobbled it up, there's a huge appetite.</p><p>DICZOK:  So there still is a lot of appetite given how strong the economy  is both investment grade and corporate bond markets are very susceptive to  new issuers.  And in particular as you saw on that there was a lot of low  ones in that one when they usually be a combination of bonds and loans.</p><p>So there has been a lot of flows into the loan space.  We think for the  foreseeable future as long as the economy continues to do well, that market  will be fine.  But as we look farther out, this 2020 and further one, if we  think about the next recession, I think the turning of the next credit  cycle will be interesting because there's going to lot more leverage in  corporate bonds, we've seen a lot more issuance in the BBB space, we've  seen a lot more in leverage loans --</p><p>FORBES:  The covenants on these bonds were non-existent.</p><p>DICZOK:  Covenant loans are a lot less right now so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Interesting by the way from a fixed income investor is really,  \"Ah\" it's really -- I mean that's a way of saying it could end really badly  in terms of these kind of riskier fixed -- areas of fixed income market.  </p><p>DICZOK:  Well what I would say is, if you think about leverage loans as an  asset class, that's one of the -- one of the questions, I think what you're  getting at.  Historically, you've got about $0.80 back on the dollar when  those loans defaulted.</p><p>Given more leverage in the system now in terms of how much we're lending to  companies, given the covenant quality you talked about.  Your -- the money  you're going to get back when these loans to follow the credit cycle turn  is probably less than that, somewhere in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.</p><p>So if just going in historical losses on leverage (INAUDIBLE) high yield,  you probably need to bring that down a little bit.  So we particularly  underweight high yield, underweight leverage loans in the moment, not as  underweight as we could be because the economy was strong and it should  continue to do well as long as the economy continues. </p><p>But when the credit cycle turns, you're going to expect greater credit  losses on these instruments and investors need to think about that and need  to think about owning to term of what investor --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Matt --</p><p>FORBES:  And do you -- and do you fear that the Fed is going to try to stop  this economic expansion on the idea that we're all overheating because  we're doing so well?</p><p>DICZOK:  That's a very important question, it's the key question Steve.  So  -</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  But this is doing it but that's not going to stop that.</p><p>DICZOK:  No one will stop them for sure.  If you listen to Mr. Powell at  Jackson Hole, he gave a good speech which was more philosophical than  specifically about the data and he was very patient.  </p><p>He referred to Allen Greenspan being patient.  You know, the data might  have told you otherwise and at the time he thought he was right because  productivity increased.  He will take it meeting-to-meeting, he will not do  too much so I don't get any sense that they're worried.  </p><p>He even said, even though the labor market is below four percent and the  Fed's longer term forecast is four and a half, does not see overheating  because inflation has not come up yet.  So as long as inflation is in check  around two percent, I think they're going to be inclined to let it run a  little bit longer.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Matt, thank you so much.  That was great insight.  Matt Diczok  from Merrill Lynch U.S. Trust.  </p><p>Coming up, President Trump taking aim at his own attorney general, what  he's saying now about Jeff Sessions.</p><p>Let's talk about a terrifying commute, the New York City floor rate is  going viral.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's  Thursday, September 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Investors keeping an eye on trade tensions between the United States and  China.

We will show you more of the subway  rat.</p><p>And on to our top story this half hour, President Trump sounding off, the  commander in chief, blasting Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an interview  with The Hill, saying this, \"I don't have an attorney general.  It's very  sad.</p><p>The President long disappointed with Sessions over his decision very early  on in the administration to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.   He also expressed frustration with Sessions in other areas saying, I'm not  happy at the border, I'm not happy with numerous things, not just this.</p><p>Here now, Bre Payton, a staff writer for the Federalist.  Bre, is there any  way that Sessions can stay on as attorney general after the midterms?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, FEDERALIST:  Yes.  I mean, really, that's the  question of the hour.  And I do think the political makeup in Congress is  going to really determine that, right?  I mean, if the Republicans are able  to hold the majority in this Senate, I think that that's going to be a key  factor in whether or not Jeff Sessions does indeed stay.  </p><p>I think that if Republicans do, you know, regain control of the senate, I  think that we could easily see a different person get confirmed in that  spot.  But I think about right now, the math is purely political and I  think Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>And, I think, perhaps the reason why he hasn't yet fired Jeff Sessions or  gotten rid of him or, you know, acted upon all of these verbal outbursts  that he has been expressing over the past couple of months, I think that,  you know, he understands that it's political and he's looking ahead of  November, looking ahead at the midterms and understands that he needs to be  strategic here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, given the fight of Brett Kavanaugh, being appointed to the  Supreme Court, at this point, it looks so smart that the President hasn't  moved to fire Jeff Sessions, because getting him -- getting another  attorney general confirmed.</p><p>Even though it seemed like just several weeks ago, Chuck Grassley, before  these developments with Kavanaugh appointment, it seemed like Grassley had  opened the door to possibly hearing about a replacement for Jeff Sessions,  but again, smart move in hindsight.</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  Yes, I mean, again, this is all politics at this  point, and right now, definitely, the recent developments with Kavanaugh on  these accusations that have been made against him have definitely thrown a  monkey wrench into a lot of plans of people on the Hill, right?  </p><p>I mean, Republicans are looking at potentially a narrow window in which  they have in order to pass a bunch of legislation and, kind of, cement the  Republican legacy, right?  I mean, they've been able to have control of  both houses and the presidency and that could very well and easily change  in November.</p><p>So, they have a short window of being able to pass a bunch of legislation  and, kind of, cement that legacy.  So, I think it is clear that, you know,  it's all political at this point.</p><p>FORBES:  Putting aside the politics of the situation, do you -- do you feel  that that Sessions has run the department well?  It seems like the  bureaucracy is running him more than he is running the bureaucracy.  And in  term -- and a lot of issues, not just the border, but all of these  investigations, he -- what's happening there?  </p><p>Why -- you know -- it is one thing to recuse yourself from Russia, but  there are a whole lot of other things he could have done to reshape that  department.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The turning over the documents that Congress has asked for.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and everything.</p><p>MCDOWEL:  Jason Chaffetz is talking about Bryan Pagliano, basically turned  his back on two subpoenas from the Oversight Committee and Chaffetz himself  went to Jeff Sessions and said, you've got to -- equal application of the  law here, you've got to prosecute this guy for not showing up for these two  subpoenas and Jeff Sessions went, I'm not going to do that, that's a  Clinton guy.</p><p>So, Bre, answer Steve's question.</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely think that it's become abundantly clear in  these releases -- earlier releases of text messages and e-mails and, you  know, OIG investigations.  I think it's clear that there's a faction of  employees within the FBI that have, you know, clearly acted, kind of, gone  rogue and done their own thing and done what they wanted to do.</p><p>And I think that we are definitely the dynamic between Sessions and Rod  Rosenstein while the Mueller investigation, you know, is under way.  I  think it is clear that there is a flank of the FBI that Sessions does not  have control over.</p><p>But I do think that Sessions throughout his tenure in office has executed  other aspects of Donald Trump's legacy and agenda, right?  I mean, cracking  down on the border, protecting religious liberty and doing other things  like that, I think, is clear that Sessions is in the same mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to this real quickly, a bid to stop Nancy Pelosi,  a group of House Democrats have signed a letter to change rules for  electing speaker.  Bre, your reaction to this move to make sure Pelosi  doesn't regain her former role?</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I'm not at all surprised.  I mean, Democrats have been  speaking out that there needs to be leadership change, particularly among  the House for -- I mean, probably a year and a half, right now, right, with  Linda Sanchez, kind of, kicking off that fire storm against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>So, I definitely I'm not at all surprised by this.  And remember when Nancy  Pelosi and her, kind of, quasi filibuster in order to push individuals to  vote a certain way when it came to shutting down the government in order to  protect the Dreamers.</p><p>Her entire caucus, virtually, voted against her while she was trying to do  that, and she tried to stay safe later on by saying, yes, I was  filibustering for this one thing but I really wanted the complete opposite  outcome.</p><p>It's clear that, you know, her caucus doesn't respect her in this and the  only reason why they kept her in that role is because she's such a good  fundraiser.  It's like taking your mom with you to the mall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get -- I want to get Marie in here, she is this  incredible fundraiser then, Marie, do you think she stays?  If -- do you  think that what happens if the Democrats do take the House?</p><p>HARF:  I think there will be a big leadership fight that Nancy Pelosi has  never had to face.  The challenge is that there's not a natural successor,  Joe Crowley actually, was one, I really wanted him to be the next speaker,  and he will not be in the next Congress.</p><p>So, right now, there's a lot of jocking inside the Democratic caucus to see  who could replace Nancy Pelosi.  As a Democrat, what I don't want is the  first thing we do if we take the House, get into a really nasty leadership  fight.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi, the historic figure, I do, though, think it's time for new  leadership.  The Republicans are going to get it.  Paul Ryan is leaving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know -- I know that you know that she is going to use her  gender as a sword and a stick to whack people with.  She's going to use it  as shield and then a stick.</p><p>HARF:  A woman may run against her, so we'll see.</p><p>FORBES:  At the end of the day, you have to run somebody against her.</p><p>HARF:  Absolutely.</p><p>FORBES:  And (INAUDIBLE) in that caucus, what kind of public persona is  going to be out there.</p><p>MURPHY:  And being able to raise money is a big thing.  So, if that's all  she's good at, that's being good at a lot.</p><p>HARF:  She's also (INAUDIBLE) inside the caucus.  But there are other  people now who are raising money.  There are other people who were stepping  up.  There's just not one person everyone's getting behind yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's only one person who said these $2,000-dollar  bonuses, crumbs, pathetic.</p><p>HARF:  You're never letting it go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, because you know what, $2,000 is not crumbs to anybody in  this country.</p><p>HARF:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a great bumper sticker, though.  Bre Payton, thank you so  much.  Good to see you.  </p><p>PAYTON:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre, come back.  Coming up, flying high and low, the best and  worst airports in the country ranked by travelers, we've got the results  ahead.  And a rough commute, a New York City subway rat, the internet loves  this guy.  I hate rats, but I really love him, because this is what all New  Yorkers go through every time it just sprinkles a little bit outside, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Elizabeth Smart says, she will not live in fear now that one of  her kidnappers is free.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen.  Wanda Barzee is a free woman, five years  early because her sentence was miscalculated even though Elizabeth Smart  had urged officials to keep her behind bars</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ELIZABETH SMART, KIDNAP VICTIM:  I just think the best thing that all of us  can do that I will continue to be, that I hope everybody else continues to  be is vigilant but also to not live in fear and to move forward with their  lives because that's certainly what I plan to do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, the 72-year-old, Barzee, is on the Utah sex offender  registry and will be on federal supervised release for five years.  Smart  was just 14 years old when Barzee and her husband at the time, Brian  Mitchell, kidnapped her in Utah, that was 2002; Mitchell is serving a life  sentence.  </p><p>Well, J.D. Power is out with its annual survey of the best and the worst  airports in America with the number of U.S. passengers at a record high  right now, two airports are sharing the top spot for the largest airport:  Las Vegas McCarran and Orlando International.  Now Detroit, Denver and DFW  -- Dallas/Fort Worth -- rounding up the top five.  Now, here's the worst,  Dagen, yes, Miami, came in 15th place followed by Boston, Chicago O'Hare,  LAX and, yes, Newark Liberty dead last.  Yes.  That New Jersey airport  earning a score of 701 out of possible 1,000 points on J.D. Power scale.   If you guys can get your TSA situation figured out, we would like you  better. </p><p>OK.  Sticking with airlines.  After JetBlue and United, it is Delta's turn.   Delta Airlines raising its first checked-bag fee from $25.00 to $30.00, and  it's now charging $40.00 for the second checked bag.  This is after JetBlue  and United recently hiked their baggage prices by $5.00 each.  Delta made  more than $900 million in baggage fees last year.  Shares of Delta, as you  can imagine, up three percent up so far this year.  </p><p>Then, there's this, remember the New York City pizza rat that went viral  after hauling a slice of pizza?  We love pizza rat.  Well, guess what,  another New York City rat has taken the Internet by storm.  Meet flood rat,  making waves after being caught on video shielding itself from rushing  water in the subway.  This video was posted to Reddit after a big rain  storm here in the city that was actually part of Hurricane Florence made  its way up north Tuesday afternoon.  New York City residents tracing the  rat.  One commented: \"Flood rat for governor.\"  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CASONE:  He is fed up with the NTA as any of us are.  For those watching  the NTA is those are subways here in New York City.  Another said, \"Well,  if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\"  The state of the flood  rat, unknown, Dagen, but he will live forever on the Internet.  Because you  know what, as you mentioned this earlier, Dagen, the struggle is real,  flood rat is us in New York City trying to deal with the subway system  during a storm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You see all that dirty water rushing into the subway station?  I  call that city gravy.  And I've fallen in it head through.  Everybody at  one point or another has flipped going down a fly to subway stairs when  it's raining and done a big yard sale where all of your stuff goes  everywhere, yes, right, Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  You bet.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We feel for the subway -- we feel for the subway rat.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I'm not a fan of the subway rat, I just want to go on the record  there -- just me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, I like snakes and reptiles more than rats because  they eat rats, but this guy, I feel sorry for.  </p><p>HARF:  He's cute.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Thank you.  Coming up, going beyond champagne and  caviar, one private jet company launching a program to take care of its  youngest travelers, we'll tell you about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Private jet travel has seen a major takeoff in recent years and  one of the top names in the field: Vista Global.  Now, Vista Global is  announcing the acquisition of XOJET -- the largest on demand business  aviation service provider in the U.S.  Joining us now in a Fox Business  Exclusive, Vista Global Chairman and Founder, Thomas Flohr, tell us more  about the acquisition, why now?  </p><p>THOMAS FLOHR, CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER, VISTA GLOBAL:  Good morning.  How are  you?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sorry, we have limited time.  So -- good morning, Tom. </p><p>FLOHR:  Well, today is a fantastic day, I think.  The presence of Vista  Global here in the U.S. is going to expand massively.  XOJET is a fantastic  brand, great people, great talent, wonderful customer base and it was  exactly the right pillar to acquire for Vista Global, next to the Vista Jet  brand.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How is business?  </p><p>FLOHR:  Business is growing continuously -- growing at 20-25 percent  annually.  We have a very, very strong growth rate all around the world.   So, North America is the biggest market as we all know in the private jet  market place.  And we just see corporations moving more and more to the  asset-like solution -- that's exactly what we offer.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love that phrase, Mike, because I know that your company was  early investors in Wheels Up, which is a competitor of you guys.  But  again, it's company that no longer want to own these assets or even lease  these assets.  So, when they've got to get somewhere quick with an  executive team, this is where they go.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, it's large companies, as you point out, in wanting to be  asset-like, but how do you look at it from a business standpoint?  You  know, how do you differentiate between you becoming asset-like, because I  know it's something that (INAUDIBLE) talks about all of the time.  Do you  want to own a larger fleet or do you want to own a smaller fleet and just  be in the middle of that?  </p><p>FLOHR:  Well, we're very happy to own the asset.  Because at the end of the  day, the crux of this industry is subject to owner release, and that's  very, very annoying and cumbersome for clients to wait until an owner of an  aircraft releases the aircraft, and then he doesn't know what aircraft to  get until the last minute.  What we offer is two consistent fleets, as of  today -- the Vista Jet fleet for guaranteed availability and the XOJET  fleet for on-demand services.  The clients know exactly what they're  getting when they book with us, because a fleet which we own, we control,  we control the quality and we control the services.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And do you see a lot of your clients coming in through an app,  getting bigger and bigger?  </p><p>FLOHR:  That's a very, very good point.  At Vista, we developed a lot of  technology, we have over 200 software developers and that's exactly where  this industry is going.  And I think, again, America is taking the lead on  that and that's really what we bring as a technology to the XOJET brand.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, this jet announced a program that is aimed at, is it  children -- it's going to turn Vista Jet cabins into playrooms and party  venues for children, please explain that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FLOHR:  OK.  Well, we always spend a lot of time with our clients and the  feedback is one out of four flights has children on the flight.  And so,  what we did is we educated and we trained our entire cabin crews on, you  know, how to entertain kids, and so we have parties on board, we can have  birthday celebrations on board and it's something which parents very much  appreciate that in the few hours that they do fly somewhere the children  are taken care of by cabin hostesses who really know what they're doing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they expect the flight attendants to be nannies.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MURPHY:  That's what they are for the flight.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tom, great to see you, thank you so much.  </p><p>FLOHR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>FORBES:  Congratulations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vista Jet.  Yes, exactly.  The good, the bad and the ugly; you  won't believe how much these sneakers are going for, next hour in MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

And it's very unfair, I think, to -- as you know, Justice  Kavanaugh has been treated very, very tough.  And his family -- I think  it's a very unfair thing what's going on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the battle on Capitol Hill.  Futures are  showing gains across the board, a 44-point gain on the Dow futures right  now.  This -- it was a bit of a mixed session yesterday.</p><p>Right now the futures on all your major markets are higher.  Yesterday it  was the Nasdaq composite of the three major market indicators that was  lower.

Why didn't the Democrats -- they knew about the letter  because she was showing it to Democrats.  Why did they wait until  everything was finished and then bring it up?  That doesn't look good.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno.  Joe --  your take on this, how this plays out?  </p><p>JOE MORENO, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Good morning -- Dagen.</p><p>It's hard to say.  I mean it's amazing that we know how important Supreme  Court confirmation hearings are and we know how important it is to respect  and protect the victims of sexual abuse.  And yet here we are in an  absolute spectacle.</p><p>I think it's a little unwise for the majority to insist on a deadline.  I  think they have to be somewhat accommodating here.  I think Senator  Grassley has gone a good way to say, look, I'm open to an open hearing, a  closed hearing.  I'm open to sending Senate interviewers to California to  have a sit-down interview.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I think he has to be accommodating to try to  make sure Dr. Ford is given the opportunity to have her piece heard.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the issue is -- Steve Forbes, you can get in here -- is that  the attorneys for the accuser and many other Democrats are demanding a full  FBI investigation.  And therein lies the rub that the FBI is not  responsible for investigating and then making political judgments on what  they find out as they would in a traditional criminal case.</p><p>Under the constitution, ultimately the Senate is the ultimate judge of  fitness of a nominee appointed by the President of the United States.   That's a constitutional requirement.</p><p>So it seems like they're at an impasse.  Chuck Grassley has gone out of his  way to say you can be in public, you can be in private.  Aides will even  fly to California to interview this woman.  Do you think we hear from her  publicly?  </p><p>FORBES: I think to use the phrase the end of the day, yes.  If you're a  victim of a crime, you go to the court.  You're subject to cross  examination.  And everyone is very sensitive here about what happened --  allegedly happened to her 35 years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  That's why Chairman Grassley has gone out of his way-- you want to  do it in public, you want to do it in private.  But at some point you have  to go out and make your case to the committee and to the public. </p><p>Judge Kavanaugh will have his say.  She should have her say in a public  forum.</p><p>She can say she didn't want to do this; the Democrats forced her to do it.   That's fine.  The American public wants to see both sides heard.  </p><p>HARF:  Joe -- this is Marie Harf here.  I have a question for you about  these other people that have been named as possibly testifying.  You know,  this accuser has put Mark Judge in the room in her account of what  happened.  Some people are saying he should have to testify.  There are  other potential witnesses.</p><p>It seems like it might make sense if we want the whole truth and nothing  but the truth to hear from more people than just Judge Kavanaugh and Dr.  Ford.  What's your take on that?  </p><p>MORENO:  I think that makes sense.  I think it has to start with Dr. Ford  and Judge Kavanaugh as any investigation would.  So you start with the  accuser.  Ok, tell us the story in your own words at your own pace with  your lawyer present.  Lay it out for us.</p><p>Then we hear about, ok, who else could corroborate this.  Let's identify  those individuals.  Then let's hear from Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>So I think it makes perfect sense to start a hearing with the two  principals but there should be an open mind at the hearing from others.  It  just seems to make sense to me.  </p><p>HARF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one of the issues is -- and the loudest, angriest voices  are from some women who are Democrats.  I talk about Senator Hirono said  all men in the country need to shut up and step up.  Joy Behar on \"The  View\" even though she is not elected, she's still considered a very loud  liberal voice.</p><p>But I'll point out if they're concerned about -- if the Democrats are about  women's rights and protecting victims, someone who is a Democrat victimized  this woman by leaking her name to the press and outing her and putting her  in a situation where she now is being called to speak in front of the  world.  So again, I just think that there's a deep, hideous irony in that.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, and she said -- Dr. Ford said she never wanted to go public.   She wanted to remain anonymous.  I have deep concerns about the fact that  Democrats did not raise it in private meetings with Kavanaugh, that they  didn't raise it in the private closed session they had with him during his  confirmation hearing.</p><p>That, in my mind, would have been a much better way to do this, allowed  both sides to question him in that setting.  But we are where we are now,  unfortunately.  And we have to figure out how to have a fair process moving  forward where we hear from her and we hear from him.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Steve -- the Democrats aren't going to be satisfied until  they have a lengthy FBI investigation that many are pushing simply to delay  this confirmation vote until after the midterms, hoping that they, by  miracle of all miracles, get a majority in the senate.  Or they hope to use  this as a bumper sticker that Republican men basically abuse women and are  all liars.  That's really the -- you want to talk about, you know, a  political football and chicanery, the Democrats are all over this.  </p><p>FORBES:  It's sadly become political.  And Dr. Ford is simply a part of  the, sadly, being the football kicked around in this whole thing.  And I  just wish there's a way for the public to realize that the Democrats have  used this not for purpose of justice but pure, raw politics and it's wrong.</p><p>And that's why I hope she testifies on Monday so the public can see it, the  committee can see it, and we can come to a conclusion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe -- Senator Claire McCaskill also tweeted that she's going to  vote no on Judge Kavanaugh last night.  That, of course, narrows the  political Democratic votes the nominee can secure but I don't think anybody  is surprised by this.</p><p>They're using this issue of the accuser as a crutch.  But these Democrats  were going to vote no against this nominee to begin with.  </p><p>MORENO:  I saw that.  First off, I think just tactically speaking, it's  really bad strategy to announce on the day someone is nominated as many  Democrats did, and since then, that they were not going to vote for this  person even before the hearings had started.  So I think that's a bad  strategy.</p><p>Look, you're going to do what you're going to do at the end of the day but  to kind of say that out front, you then taint the entire process because  there's no pretense anymore that there's any objectivity.  You've already  made your decision.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Joe -- it's Mike Murphy.  Do you see a situation where we can hear  from the accuser and get her story and then just quickly follow up with a  vote on Judge Kavanaugh?  Is there a way that like respect her but also  respect the process at the same time?  </p><p>MORENO:  Look I think there's multiple ways to get the story from the  accuser.  You could do it -- like we said, in hearings, closed or open.   You can do it in interviews.  You'll probably even get an affidavit from  her.  And then that will just go to the weight of the evidence.</p><p>Obviously, if you can't ask her questions, then the evidence has less  weight.  So an affidavit is not going to be as powerful as verbal  testimony.</p><p>Look, I think that it's really important not just for Judge Kavanaugh and  Dr. Ford but for the American people to restore some confidence in this  process.  So I think that Republicans have to be amenable to accommodation  but also not be taken advantage of.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they have been amenable despite what say Senator Hirono was  alleging in this expletive that she used in an interview yesterday.</p><p>Joe -- great to see you.  Thank you for being here.  Joe Moreno.</p><p>MORENO:  Thanks.  Good to be on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting this.  \"Financial and job numbers are  fantastic.  There are plenty of new high paying jobs available in our great  and very vibrant economy.  If you are not happy where you are, start  looking.  But also remember our economy is only getting better.  Vote in  midterms (exclamation point).\"  I'm going to give you two seconds to  respond to that because this economy is firing as I said on all cylinders.  </p><p>FORBES:  And the President is doing what he should have done several weeks  ago.  Just hammer away at this good economy and contrast that to what  you're going to get from the Democrats starting to take away your tax cuts  and things like that.</p><p>So the way he's handled the Kavanaugh-Ford situation, very measured.   Hitting on the economy; he should tweet the economy every day.  There's a  great story coming out every day.  And the Republicans should also get a  real tax cut on the table, another subject maybe for later.  What they have  at now is porridge.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Porridge -- how so?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, saying we'll make it permanent.  Oh great.  But what more  cuts are you going to put on the table?  You know, 2025 it might expire.   What about tomorrow?  Put a new tax cut on the table, a real tax cut --  reduced tax rates increases them.  Give something people can put -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's the top tax rate -- 37 percent?</p><p>FORBES:  37 percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not low enough.  Not low enough says Steve Forbes.  Thank you --  Steve.</p><p>FORBES:  Too high for everybody.  Everybody is paying too many taxes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Porridge.</p><p>Coming up -- an airport in Florida on lockdown.  The latest development as  Orlando Melbourne International is closed after an unauthorized student  boarded a plane.</p><p>Plus a public relations nightmare -- details on the shocking report that  accuses Ticketmaster of colluding with scalpers -- ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news -- a Florida airport on lockdown.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more on this developing story -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  We're tracking  all the breaking news right now out of Melbourne International Airport.  It  was closed earlier because of an authorized student -- an unauthorized,  excuse me, student that boarded a commercial jet.</p><p>All flights were suspended.  Police were investigating at the time.  The  student has been apprehended.  Melbourne police said that the airport  terminal is now open and has returned to normal operations.  They advise  though passengers to check with their carriers.  There may be some flight  delays out of this airport because of this incident earlier this morning.</p><p>Well, in other headlines for you, South Korean President Moon Jae-in says  that Kim Jong-un wants to quickly complete denuclearization, focus on the  economy and hold a second meeting with President Trump as soon as possible.   Moon just returned to Seoul after a three-day summit with Kim that was held  in North Korea.</p><p>Earlier today, the two leaders visited a sacred mountain.  They toured the  crater of the volcano.  You can see the pictures there.  Moon also says  that he's going to carry a private message from Kim for Trump when he meets  Trump in New York on Monday when the U.N. General Assembly gets underway  here in New York City.</p><p>Well, Britain's takeover regulator says the fight between 21st Century Fox  and Comcast to take over Sky is now going to go to an auction procedure.   21st Century Fox is the parent company of this network.  The British  takeover panel says the auction will start tomorrow and end Saturday with a  maximum of three rounds of bidding.  Sky has a market cap of more than $35  billion right now.</p><p>Then there is this.  Today's a good day to have a pizza party because it is  national pepperoni pizza day.  It's a good day -- everybody.  The spicy  meat is America's favorite topping on a piece of pizza and pizza stores all  over the country are offering deals.  So happy national pepperoni pizza day  to everybody. </p><p>We're having a little taste test this morning -- guys.  We have Little  Caesar's.  We have Domino's.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is Domino's -- Steve.  That's Little Caesar's.  So how  about it?</p><p>CASONE:  So dig in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go for it.  You don't want to mess up your lipstick -- Marie  Harf.  </p><p>HARF:  That's what I'm considering right now.  But I'm going to do it.</p><p>MURPHY:  These are great -- </p><p>HARF:  Which are you trying first?  Domino's or Little Caesar's.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We have to dive in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So I'm not -- it's not that I'm on a diet which -- anyway.  But  I -- </p><p>CASONE:  You're healthier than the rest of us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no.  But I eat vegan.  That's by choice.  So don't throw hate  at me.  Just embrace that.  That's why I'm not eating it.  </p><p>CASONE:  I have an idea though for pizza companies, if you're watching.   They should come up with a vegan cheese, vegan pepperoni.  You know, like a  soy base -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are -- </p><p>MURPHY:  That's the thing.</p><p>CASONE:  That can be really good. </p><p>MURPHY:  And gluten-free.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  And gluten-free -- why not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can make a pizza that is vegan with plant-based cheese and  delicious tomato sauce and lots of arugula on top of it and beyond meat.   Steve -- that's for you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Nothing says breakfast, Marie Harf, like pepperoni pizza.  So  thanks for, you know, jumping into this.</p><p>HARF:  This is delicious.</p><p>CASONE:  It's nice and greasy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So which do you like better -- Steve?  </p><p>MURPHY:  You didn't try the Little Caesar's.  </p><p>HARF:  I haven't tried Little Caesar's yet.</p><p>CASONE:  Ok.</p><p>FORBES:  This is good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the Little Caesar's, I think.</p><p>FORBES:  I haven't had this before.</p><p>HARF:  Isn't there -- I think there's cheese in the crust.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's cheese in the crust.</p><p>CASONE:  There's cheese in the crust.</p><p>HARF:  I like -- </p><p>FORBES:  I love having to eat pizza as part of the job.  </p><p>HARF:  The Domino's is better, I think.  </p><p>CASONE:  You like the Domino's better.</p><p>HARF:  I'm weighing in.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Wow.</p><p>HARF:  I like the Little Caesar's.</p><p>CASONE:  I do want to add really quick.  Across the country, there are  pizza specials everywhere.  Just check out your local pizza store because  it's pepperoni pizza day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  And beyond -- </p><p>FORBES:  The nice thing is, unlike wine tastings, you don't have to spit it  out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who spits out the wine at wine tastings?  Oh, am I doing it  wrong?  </p><p>HARF:  No.  I just drink it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Me too.</p><p>HARF:  I just drink it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeted again, \"We protect the countries of  the Middle East.  They would not be safe for very long without us.  And yet  they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices.  We will remember,  the OPEC monopoly must get prices down now.\"</p><p>We protect the countries of the Middle East.  They would not be safe --  must get prices down right now.  All right.  So that's the gist of it.  I'm  not going to repeat that tweet a second time.</p><p>Coming up, the state of American startups -- we break down how new  businesses are doing under President Trump.  That's next.</p><p>And move over Justin Timberlake -- we'll tell you who is performing at the  next Super Bowl.  Is it a yes or a nay -- ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Talk about this number of people who are signing up for new tax  IDs as a sign of new business development, new businesses being started in  this country.  </p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  It's skyrocketing, you know.   If you're going to start a business, you need a tax ID.  And the tax ID  applications are going up at a rate that I've never seen.  Not only are  they going up at a much faster rate than they were when President Trump  took office, but they're accelerating.  They're really going to the moon  right now.</p><p>And that's a sign that we've once again created a vibrant economy where  businesses want to get going and operate.  And it's exactly what President  Trump promised he would do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump's critics claiming that the recent trade  disputes with China are hurting businesses.  But our next guest says that  under the President, startups are booming.</p><p>Here now is eSignature Guarantee founder Seth Farbman.  Seth -- you're  known as a serial start-up guy so what is it like doing business now in  this economy?  This economic -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SETH FARBMAN, FOUNDER, ESIGNATURE GUARANTEE:  I think we're in a tremendous  opportunity for anybody that has an idea to launch a company right now.   One of our companies, V-Check Global was just named to the Inc5000.  And  they did a poll and they said that 70 percent of the CEOs feel that we're  in an environment that's as supportive of startups and entrepreneurship as  ever before.  So I think -- people think that there's an opportunity right  now.</p><p>FORBES:  So what's been the biggest change?  As you know, the last two  quarters, we've had a record number of startups, first time in a generation  that's really ginned up.  What are the specific things that are getting  people saying let's go for it?  </p><p>FARBMAN:  You know, I think that the opportunity to be able to tell your  story on different platforms, whether it's LinkedIn or Instagram, is giving  people the chance to reach an audience that historically they never could.   They would just put out a press release and hope that somebody reads their  story or shows up at their front door.</p><p>At the same time, with such a large audience, a startup has to really be  able to capture the attention of that audience and really be able to add  value, otherwise having that platform isn't going to add any value.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Seth -- we run venture capital funds, Rosecliff Ventures.  We have  over 70 companies in our portfolio.  And we meet new and exciting companies  all the time.  I think one thing that we're seeing right now is people have  a phone in their pocket which is a high powered computer.  So they can get  working on an idea without that much startup capital initially.</p><p>But then we see so much capital out there, chasing good ideas that you hear  from some people that were in the late innings of start-ups being a thing.   I think we're just getting started.  I think the entrepreneurial spirit in  this country is in the very early innings.  I think we're going to see a  lot more it.  </p><p>FARBMAN:  I agree.  And anything that can take technology and bring it to a  vertical is going to -- is going to have a chance at success.  For example,  (INAUDIBLE) -- we've taken the compliance and the regulatory world of stock  transfer and we've added the ability to verify somebody's identity online  to be able to provide them with this medallion stamp, which is essentially  like a notary on steroids.</p><p>If we can take technology and bring it to different verticals, then I think  as you said, the computer in your pocket is really something that's going  to be a game changer in the startup world.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, talk about how the administration, the Trump  administration has also changed the regulatory environment.  So you have a  new tax environment with lower corporate tax, lower taxes for all, really  and then also fewer regulations; is that part of the equation of people  wanting to start businesses?  </p><p>FARBMAN:  I think so.  In other words, I come from that regulatory world.   I had V-Check which is background checks, V-Stock, vintage filings which  did that filings we sold to Peer Newswire (ph).  So I'm a very corporate  services focused person.  And if you can take regulation and make it  easier, you know, not every great idea out there makes money.</p><p>That's something that all these potential startups have to understand.  But  at the same token, if you can take technology and combine it with  regulation to be able to really take away a pain point, that's I think the  secret to success. </p><p>Not just to say like oh, I have a great idea and it would be nice if, but  rather that if you've got like a migraine level problem and you're solving  that problem, those are the ideas that I find -- I don't know if you find  that in the private equity world -- those are the best types of companies.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I agree -- totally.  </p><p>FORBES:  So looking ahead, what would you like to see done next to keep  this momentum going?  </p><p>FARBMAN:  You know, I think that we have to be -- </p><p>FORBES:  What's your wish list?  </p><p>FARBMAN:  -- supportive of these companies.  You mentioned the valuation  issue.  You know, I personally try to get up every day and just build the  company.  I don't focus on the potential valuations and raising capital.   As long as you can make a profitable company and generate business, I think  the valuation will come.</p><p>And I'd like to see the people really focus on providing a tangible  product, a tangible service and something that really solves a problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The most successful entrepreneurs do that, like yourself.</p><p>FARBMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seth -- thank you so much.</p><p>FARBMAN:  I appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Seth Farbman -- be well.</p><p>Coming up, Florence's destruction -- we head down to North Carolina one day  after President Trump met with victims of this horrific flooding.</p><p>Plus, Ticketmaster under fire -- details on the shocking report accusing  the company of working with scalpers.

President Trump  touring the Carolinas, seeing areas impacted by this deadly storm.  This as  we're learning that the cleanup could last years.  </p><p>Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins is live in Fayetteville, North  Carolina as the sun is rising on that very beautiful part of the country.   Good morning, Griff.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.  Beautiful.   But it's going to take days, probably weeks for Fayetteville to get back on  its feet because of the flooding in the Cape Fear River.  Let me give you a  shot here.  This is the main bridge in downtown over the Cape Fear River.   It flooded at record levels, 61.5 feet, the flood stage is just under 35  feet.  If you look at the drone footage that the city council -- city  council and (INAUDIBLE) giving us, it's just unbelievable the damage it's  done.  We were able to sit down and talk a little bit with the mayor here,  Mitch Colvin.  And he had a message for President Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCH COLVIN, MAYOR, FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA:  If I ever get an  opportunity to speak to the administration and the people in the White  House, I want to tell them that, that is something and I'm very concerned  with as the small businesses is getting back up and running.  Two years ago  when we had Matthew, you know, FEMA was here in -- very quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  Over 700 structures damaged in downtown Fayetteville.  They had  136 rescues and, sadly, one of the 37 deaths attributed to the storm here  in Fayetteville.  The president talking to communities just like this  yesterday.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're getting all teed up  for a lot of money to come down to the area.  You're going to need it.  And  we have it and we will be supplying it and there will be nothing left  undone.  We'll have everything you need.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  And as the recovery begins, moving around is still difficult.  I- 95, south of here, towards Lumberton, still flooded in some parts, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Griff, thank you so much for your reporting today and all the  work that you've done down in North Carolina.  Thank you Griff.</p><p>Joining us now is Zack Rosenberg, he is the founder of SBP USA.  An  organization whose mission it is to shrink the time between disaster and  recovery.  What are you doing so far, Zack, down in the Carolinas? </p><p>ZACK ROSENBERG, FOUNDER, SBP USA:  Well, good morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Good morning.  Thank you for having me.  So, our team arrived  in New Bern last night.  We're going to start with the gutting work.  We're  going to train other organizations to do gutting the right way.  We're  focusing on mold remediation as well.  </p><p>The big picture Dagen, is that, people need a clear, predictable path to  recovery.  So, we're focusing on a few areas.  </p><p>First of all, we need to make sure that the people impacted by Florence get  and maintain all the funds available to them.  We have PSAs going out  sponsored by Walmart that are focusing on how to navigate FEMA, how to  maximize insurance so they can collect as much resources as they have but  not fritter of it away.  So, we're focusing on contractor-fraud.  We want  this to be as close to a hundred percent contractor-fraud free recovery as  possible.  </p><p>In hurricane Harvey, 150,000 people downloaded our contractor-fraud  information and then we're trying to bust some myths around mold.  This is  a time when -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, go ahead about them.  I was actually having a private  conversation yesterday about that in some ways, wind is better than water  damage.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it is so difficult to repair a home after it's been  partially or almost fully under water for a number of days like this.  So  continue on that note.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Well, yes, it's doable.  There's some mystique and there's some  myths out there.  I think back to a storm that hits like Louisiana and we  were doing some recovery work out there.  And my team met an American  soldier, he was deploying in two days.  We went out to do this mold work.   And he said I got it covered, I paid some guy $16,000 to do mold  remediation for about a foot and-a-half of water.  And so, what we're  trying to do is make sure folks understand the honest truth.  Mold is  dangerous but it's something that can be remediated either by themselves or  for a manageable cost.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zack, before we move on, where can people get this information?</p><p>ROSENBERG:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  About how to avoid contractor fraud, how they can apply for aid  from the federal government?  Where can they go to get this?  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  It's on our website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sbpusa.org\">www.sbpusa.org</url>.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p>ROSENBERG:  And we'll send a link to you and if you want to post it on your  show we would be pleased for that to happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will tweet that link out, absolutely.  It's on the screen  by the way, but I will tweet it out, make sure everybody here tweets it out  as well.  </p><p>Before we oven it up to the panel.  Will you do us a favor, Griff Jenkins  for several days was down in Pollocksville, North Carolina, which is right  near New Bern.  The town was completely flooded.  Darrell Bell is one of  the business owners in this tiny, little southern town.  And I mean, it's  just heart-breaking.  And I promised him yesterday I would talk to my  friends.  I was on the phone last night, trying to tell people like when  the floodwaters receive, get down the Pollocksville help the Bell, help the  people of that town.  Will you make sure you reach out to that town as  well?  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Certainly.  And if Mr. Bell wants to contact us, we would be  glad to talk to him.  Investing in small businesses is essential.  After  storms 40 percent of businesses that don't open for a day will never come  back.  And so, we as communities have to focus on the heart of our country,  the small businesses that employ people.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  I think what you're doing  is incredible.  But when you see these towns a year out or three years out,  you see how the recovery is there and they're often booming.  Do you -- do  you send that as part of your message to people, like, hey look, you're  going through a disaster right now but with our help there's a brighter  side here.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Yes, there has to be hope without a doubt and there has to be  goals.  What we suggest that government executives do is set up -- just  like business, you set a goal.  No one can run a four minute mile by  training as hard as they can.  They have benchmarks to want to achieve  along the way.  And it's the same thing for recovery.  So, we need mayors  and governors saying this recovery is going to be done by x date, here's  what success looks like and then you can build a plan to achieve that goal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  SBP has received many accolades for being a top charity for  hurricane relief.  It was started after hurricane Katrina, was it not?  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  That's correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, and you got a grant from the J.J. Watt Foundation to rebuild  homes in Houston.  You're also partnering with a friend of this program  Jake Wood.</p><p>ROSENBERG:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The founder of Team Rubicon.  Tell us about some of those --  that work that you've done in Texas.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Yes.  So, for SBP, success isn't just doing the work ourselves  but again, shrinking the time between disaster and recovery.  That means we  have some upstream policy solutions but it also means expanding the  capacity of the groups on the ground doing the work.  If it was any of our  family members we wouldn't care if the rebuilding was being done by the  folks in the blue shirt, the yellow shirt or the green shirt, you just want  the work to get done.  </p><p>Toyota trained us to build houses the way they built cars.  And they have  this notion of (INAUDIBLE) if you do it well, share it with others.  </p><p>So, J.J. Watt invested $8.5 billion in SBP.  We're investing half of that  into other nonprofit groups as well as what I think is one of America's  best resources, Americore members.  So, we have a number of Americore  numbers that were investing into other nonprofit groups.  Jake's group, my  twin, obviously, -- it's not that funny.  I mean, it's a little similar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, twin in heart and spirit and soul.  Go ahead.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  We've been on the shows together.  And my feet dangle on it.   It almost looks like he's sitting at dining room chair.  </p><p>So, Team Rubicon is again, another one of the best assets we have in our  country.  And we're very proud of them, that they're moving from being best  in class in the response phase to moving to the recovery phase.  And  they're now building houses with our partnership.  So, they're building  houses in Houston, they're building houses in Florida and they put on I  think 400 roofs in Puerto Rico as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is really hard, Nat Candido our stage manager here set up a  charity after super storm Sandy here.</p><p>ROSENBERG:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we filled up cars with goods and were on the ground like a  couple of days after the storm passed through.  But it is really hard to  know who -- again, it is that kind of organization that you're talking  about, to find out who needs what and when and how to respond and it really  does take kind of a corporate management structure.  Because you're on the  ground with all these food and supplies and then distributing them is a lot  harder than you might think.  So, people want to help.  So, we'll send them  to your website.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  We would love it.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zack, Zack Rosenberg, thank you so much.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Please come back and give us an update as the recovery  progresses.  </p><p>ROSENBERG:  Love to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the rebuilding.  Thank you.</p><p>ROSENBERG:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And stay tuned, we're going to be talking to Health and Human  Services secretary Alex Azar on the health concerns from Florence in less  than an hour.  </p><p>Coming up, the performance of a lifetime, we reveal the artist reportedly  set to headline the next Super Bowl half time show.  </p><p>And stepping into controversy, how much do these dirty sneakers cost?   Prepare for the backlash when we come back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ticketmaster accused of colluding with scalpers.  Cheryl Casone  has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, Dagen.  This is  interesting, a week's long investigation by CBC and the Toronto Star has  reportedly shown that a Ticketmaster representative trying to recruit  scalpers which would allow the site to collect double fees from customers  in that same process.  </p><p>Now, the rep told undercover reporters that they could use hundreds of  accounts on the company's resale platform called Trade Desk to buy up  tickets and Ticketmaster won't crack down on them, basically.  </p><p>The report also accuses Ticketmaster of timing the release of tickets to  make it appear the demand is higher than it actually is.  Ticketmaster has  denied these accusations of price manipulation and collusion with  gallopers.  But again, that was an investigative report from CBC news up in  Canada.  </p><p>Well, a new study finding that added sugars in yogurt are contributing to  the obesity epidemic.  Researchers at the University of Leeds say that nine  out of 10 fail to qualify for a green traffic light nutrition label because  they have more than five grams of sugar per 100 grams.  The researchers are  urging consumers to study the nutritional labels before they buy yogurt  because they might be loaded for sugar.  Here we go.</p><p>And what can you buy for $530 on Nordstrom's website.  Well, here you go a  beat up pair of sneakers made by Italian designer Golden Goose.  The dingy  taped up sneakers seriously, triggered a lot of backlash on social media.   Many people say the sneakers are distasteful, offensive and they glorify  poverty, Dagen.  500 plus for those?  Don't think so.  Pass them over here  but also get back to you over there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  I love it.  Mike Murphy knew who made those  shoes.  By just looking at the -- looking at the design of them.</p><p>MURPHY:  They're one of the hottest shoe brands out there.  But I direct  people to Allbirds for $95.00 and you can wash them.  </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY STRATEGIST AND POLITICAL  COMMENTATOR:  Allbirds are great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's an investor in Allbirds.  </p><p>HARF:  They're great.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They are great.</p><p>HARF:  And I'm not even an investor.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, that's Allbirds.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES:  So, these  sneakers sell for $500 and everyone's outraged.  I still don't get why you  pay $300 for a pair of blue jeans that look like they came out of a  dumpster.   MCDOWELL:  We can top all of that.  The Balenciaga jacket that makes you  look like Steve Bannon, which is $9,000.  </p><p>HARF:  No one wants that look -- no one wants that look.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I actually saw -- I actually saw a photo of somebody wearing  that jacket the other day.  And I thought, you looked like Steve Bannon.   Thank you -- thank you -- thank you.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting this, on a more serious note.  I want to know  where is the money for border security and the wall in this ridiculous  spending bill.  And where will it come from after the midterms?  Dems are  obstructing law enforcement and border security.  Republicans must finally  get tough.  </p><p>The president signed that giant omnibus spending bill earlier this (AUDIO  GAP) After he signed it, he regretted it because there wasn't much funding  for the border wall.  He said that he would veto the next one.  So, I might  listen if I worked in congress.  </p><p>Coming up, a whole new space jam.

The President will hold a  rally in Las Vegas tonight as the midterm elections loom.  The GOP pushes  ahead -- full steam ahead on confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court.  Blake Burman is joining us with the very latest from the White  House.  Good morning, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Republicans who control the Senate  Judiciary Committee have given Christine Blasey Ford an ultimatum.  Let us  know by tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.  Friday at 10:00 a.m. if you will  testify before that committee on Monday, or not.  Chuck Grassley, the top  Republican who runs that committee says he is giving Ford four different  options on how to make that possible.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Where  I'm focused right now is doing everything that we can to make Dr. Ford  comfortable with coming before our committee either in an open session or  closed session or a public or a private interviews.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh who Ford says sexually  assaulted her at a party during their high school years denies that  allegation and says he is ready to head back to the Hill Monday.  But  Ford's attorney said last night in a statement that timeline is hurried,  \"the committee stated plans to move forward with a hearing that has only  two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation.\"</p><p>They go on to write, the rush to a hearing is unnecessary and contrary to  the committee discovering the truth.  Ford's attorneys have also called for  law enforcement investigation before she would testify, a position that  Democrats support as well.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (R), NEW YORK:  I think staying there testify on  Monday, or not be heard I think it is fairly outrageous.  And what's really  shocking to me that is that there is a normal process for a Supreme Court  justice nomination, and it starts with an FBI background check.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, President Trump continues to stand by his FBI -- his  Supreme Court nominee rather.  The President said yesterday that if Ford  were to testify up the Hill, that would be \"wonderful.\"  If not, he  described that as \"unfortunate.\"  As for the President know official public  events on his schedule today, he will thought head later today to Las Vegas  for a campaign rally there tonight.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.  And let's  turner to the political impact of this and those midterm elections.  47  days away in an increasingly partisan season.  My next guest is launching a  super PAC to support President Trump's agenda in the face of escalating  liberal backlash.  Here with us now is former presidential candidate Herman  Cain.  Tell us about the initiative in terms of the President's agenda.</p><p>Steve Forbes was talking about some of the results that this country is  already seen, good morning.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Good morning, Dagen.  And  that's what people should focus on.  And that's what we are going to be  focusing on with the super PAC called America Fighting Back.  And people  can help and we need their help at americafighting backpack.com or AFB.com.   Here is why we started this.  The liberal media and you know who they are,  they basically report 90 percent negative about this president.</p><p>And about the results that we are getting similar to the ones that Steve  just alluded to.  90 percent negative.  This is -- our objective is simple.   Number one, help maintain control of the United States House and the United  States Senate and to support the President's agenda through 2020.  And I  have often said, you don't have to love the tree to love the fruit.  The  fruit is great.</p><p>But all the liberal media and the Democrats want to focus on, they want to  focus on bringing down the tree.  And so this super PAC America Fighting  Back, is going to fight back against the negativity.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Steve have said this, I will debate policy all day long,  personality not.  What do you have to say to Herman?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well Herman, the Republicans won going to have an agenda, positive  agenda, not just saying the economy is good but how they're going to make  it better.  And, two, the President looks like he is now going to be  focusing on the economy at a great tweet this morning.  The key thing is  set the agenda and not get sidetracked.  The Republicans going to do it and  finally, Herman, persuade the Republicans and get a real tax cut proposal  out there.</p><p>So people have a Christmas present to look forward to if they win.  </p><p>CAIN:  I agree with you one hundred percent, Steve.  And the thing is yes,  this Super PAC along with a lot of other organizations and PACs that are  out there, they are doing a good job of trying to get a positive message  out about the results that this president and this administration that they  are producing.  However, the message is sometimes overwhelmed, and what  sets us apart is that we will have a voice, this voice and a face, this  face to the T.V. ad campaign that we're going to be running.  </p><p>And you're right, it's difficult at times to get all of the Republicans to  get on the same page.  We also hope that this would be a vehicle for them  to help get on the same page and deliver that messages as well as that  Christmas present you talked about which we know is working out fantastic  and they now have momentum behind them as well as actual results based on  what you mentioned that Steve Forbes heard about yesterday.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- in blue states there are about 20 Republicans --  representatives in blue states that are vulnerable, they're all getting hit  on assault thing losing to local deductions.  How are you going to counter  that to save these 20 Republicans?  </p><p>CAIN:  Our second tactic is a targeted campaign in those very vulnerable  states.  Remember the Super PAC we're not going to coordinate with them but  we know where these races are close.  And we have technology that will  allow us to target these races so we can then go in and target the voters  in those states to tell them the truth.  All we have to do is tell people  the truth, they will make the right decisions.</p><p>So we are targeting those races in order to try to help out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marie has a question for you, Herman. </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Herman, Marie Harf here, there  is a lot of evidence in polls and anecdotally that the Republican voters  are not that fired up this November.  Democrats are really enthusiastic,  their base is ready to go vote and a lot of stories about Republicans not  believing that they might lose the House, there is a lot of apathy.  It  seems like upon Republicans voters.  How are you going to help tackle that  issue?  </p><p>CAIN:  The thing that I talked about on my show yesterday that's posted at  my Web site, Hermancain.com, Republicans and Conservatives don't stay home.   Don't believe that it's a slam dunk.  This is how we're going to counter it  by encouraging people through the various platforms that we participate  with to tell people you can't -- you can't take it for granted.  Don't  assume just because the fruit meaning the results of this administration of  this President are so good, that it is impossible for people to vote for  Democrats, no.  The -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I was just -- </p><p>CAIN:  They are using nefarious deceptive rhetoric in order to try to get  people's vote for Democrats which is a bad idea as you know and this is  what we are fighting with our messages.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Marie is kind of a big old Democrat because she actually  worked in the State Department Undersecretary State John Kerry, worked in  the Obama administration, so you're kind of -- but this is an issue and I  want to get to there is one other thing about Alibaba,  Chairman Jack Ma  walk -- has walked back promise to create one million jobs in the United  States.</p><p>Saying that the trade dispute is to blame the Chinese tech billionaire who  made this promise in 2017 while speaking with then-President Elect Trump,  said his commitment contingent on good relations between the U.S. and  China, and these retaliatory tariffs are specifically targeted whether  you're talking about China or even what Europe has done at red districts  and Republican districts.  So it's political.  What this retaliation from  these nations, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  You're absolutely right.  First, Marie not all Democrats, we can  only save the savable, OK?  Now, to your point, Dagen, this is the points  that I want to make, if it's a good business decision for Alibaba they will  eventually come back with that offer, that's what's going to drive it.   Secondly, I understand why he may have retracted it because maybe he didn't  want to ruffle feathers of the Chinese government at that particular time.</p><p>But ultimately, if this is a goods business decision and these negotiations  and this tension is reduced, it could be something that he would readdress,  simply because he is motivated by making a good business decision but he  has to put up a smiley face right now to say that he is on the side of the  Chinese government.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well said, Herman.  Thank you so much for being here.   Herman Cain.  Pleasure always, sir.  </p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  Health hazards after Hurricane Florence standing  water in overflow of farm waste causing a public health emergency in the  Carolinas.

I'm Cheryl Casone with some of your headlines.  A suspect arrested  after the murder of a jogger in the nation's capital.  Police in Washington  arrested a man last night after a FEMA jogger was stabbed multiple times  and killed in a residential neighborhood.  Police are expected to hold a  news conference to give us more details on the case at 10:30 a.m.  Eastern  time this morning.</p><p>After being attacked Tuesday night, 35-year-old Wendy Martinez who has  newly engaged stumbled into a takeout restaurant for help.  She later died  at a hospital.  Police believe she was likely a random target.  </p><p>Well, breaking news this morning.  Shares of Under Armour, they're actually  rallying in premarket up more than three percent right now.  The company  says it is going to cut about 474 jobs as part of a restructuring plan.   That works out to three percent of its global workforce.  Under Armour also  raising its profit outlook for 2018.  Under Armour also releasing its new  rock sneakers today as in, yes, the rock.  There you go.</p><p>Well, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been reelected head of the  ruling liberal Democratic Party third term.  Abe is on course to become  Japan's longest serving prime minister in August of 2021.  He finishes out  his term of course.  Abe won the election on a landslide receiving 70  percent of the votes.  </p><p>And there is this.  Some main lobsters are getting baked before getting  boiled.  Let me explain.  The restaurant Charlotte's Legendary Lobster  Pound which is in Seawall is getting some its lobsters high on pot.  They  blow the smoke into their tank before they cook them.  The owner, Charlotte  Gill is a registered medical marijuana caregiver and she says doing this  seems bit more humane.</p><p>Earlier researches found lobsters have an advanced nervous system and may  feel pain.  Gill says a lobster she experimented on is much calmer  afterwards.  And then she released it back to the ocean.  She's only going  to use this method if a customer requests it.  All right.  Coming up,  optimism waning.  The risks and worries, some top executives have about why  this economic sweet spot won't last much longer.</p><p>Plus, move over pizza rat.  A New York rodent also discovered in a New York  City subway.  It's taking the internet by storm.  You don't want to miss  that one.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome Back.  How long can the economic boon last?  A new  Deloitte survey finds less than half of chief financial officers expect  better economic conditions in a year and that's the lowest recorded in  eight quarters.  Joining us with much more on these findings.  A first on  Fox Business interview.  Deloitte's Global CFO program leader Sandy  Cockrell.  Sandy, good to see you.  </p><p>SANDY COCKRELL, GLOBAL LEADER OF THE CFO PROGRAM, DELOITTE TOUCHE  TOHMATSU  LIMITED:  Dagen, great to see you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you read and let's start with that statistic.  How do you  read into that?  What does that tell you about the road ahead?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, first of all, it's really important.  The second quarter  has some of the highest survey recordings, you know, we have ever seen.  So  we're coming down some very high metrics.  And if you look at the U.S.  economy, the North American company, nine out of 10 CFOs still say at least  good.  So that's positive.  One of the statistics that just jumped out of  us is definitely -- think actually positive again, dividend growth.</p><p>7.4 percent forecasted dividend growth over next year.  That is a survey  record just off the charts.  So especially in retail wholesale and energy  and resources stocks.  So those investors are sitting pretty good right  now.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  So, Sandy, two  things, one, are these public companies?  The CFOs of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  130 some CFOs participated this quarter.  We've done this  for eight years and most all of these are from public multinational  companies with billion dollars of sales.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And just historically, are they a good indicator or, you know,  because sometimes they'll see people -- results like this come in as  contrarian indicators.  They're historically been good at predicting.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  All the metrics, we follow a number of metrics.  Revenue  growth, earnings growth, capital expenditures are in growth and those  metrics really do kind of follow other economic indices in pretty good way.   Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  Are these companies have large international component?  Do they  make a distinction between what they see in Europe and Asia versus the  U.S.?</p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  And do they see the U.S. as being good and the rest of the world  being bad or to think U.S. is in trouble?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Steve, what we saw this quarter is still huge amount of optimism  for the North American economy.  For the Chinese economy and the European  economy they slid.  If you look at China, so only 32 percent of the CFOs  said the Chinese economy is good today, 55 percent last quarter.  So, huge  dramatic shift.  You got to wonder if CFOs are worried about the trade  wards and tariffs --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  How much damage let's say, worst happens, 25 percent tariffs the  end of the year, sales taxes on 207 billion or whatever number of imports.   What do you think that's going to do, the U.S. economy into the global  economy.  How much damage?  Right now people sort of pooh-pooh it but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, we're starting to see -- you know, it's interesting if you  think where we are in calendar year.  Most calendar companies are just  starting their planning processes for 2019.  If you're a multinationalist  pushing a lot of goods or global supply chain, you really just scratching  your head as to what to do your pricing, what does that do to margins and  all those things.  And that got reflected in company --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  So is this uncertainty affecting investment decisions?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes, yes.  In other -- and just to that point, there is a huge  bias this quarter to invest organically as opposed to inorganically through  M&amp;A, partly due to uncertainty.  Secondly, 71 percent of the CFOs said that  U.S. equity markets were overvalued.  Now that was basically a month ago,  S&amp;P 500 has moved up three percent since then.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if you think the market is overvalued, would that impact  share buybacks, would you take that money and invest it in a different way?</p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, you know, that's the interesting thing with the 7.4  percent forecasted dividend growth, that really comes from a few things.   Number one, obviously company performance has been very strong.  You know,  forecasting 8.1 percent basically earnings growth over the next 12 months.   So a lot of cash accumulation from that second tax reform in two elements.   Number one, lower rate and number two for multinationals having the ability  to repatriate cash in effective way.</p><p>And number three, companies and CFOs are a lot more sensitive today about  their capital allocation methodologies because of activism.  You have to  be.  And so that's really fueling dividend growth over the next year.  </p><p>FORBES:  Activism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to --</p><p>FORBES:  Can you spell that out?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well --</p><p>MURPHY:  It's fine.  Go ahead, Steve.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  He said activism spell that out.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  So shareholder activism and basically investors expecting  a lot more in terms of overall returns.  We see this in the news every day,  you really got to stay on toes to be able to not be a target of activist.   And a company that has a lot of cash sitting on balance sheet that doesn't  explain what they're going to do with it, they become a target.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, real quick.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So just real quick.  So ultimately, the results of this study are  that the economy is good but they don't see it being great for that long.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes. The North American economy is very strong.  When we ask  what does it looked like a year from now, less than half the CFOs said the  U.S. economy will be better one year from now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's kind of the paid worry warts, aren't they, Steve?   They're the ones who are paid to worry while the CEOs think kind of big  picture 10 years down the road.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  Well, I get to a spend a lot of time with CFOs, I think  they're pretty good people. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't say worry warts were bad people.  Why do you think I  bite my fingernails?  Sandy, thank you.</p><p>COCKRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank so much.  Great insight in the survey.</p><p>COCKRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sandy Cockrell from Delloite.  Coming up.  The battle for Sky  TV.  The latest on the bidding war between Comcast and the parent company  of this network, 21st Century Fox later this hour.  And a cryptic  countdown.  We revel the secret behind Olive Garden's mysterious countdown  clock ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, September 20th.  And we've got breaking news  right here right now.</p><p>Jobless claims coming in for the most recent week, look at that coming in  well below expectations which is good, 201,000.  The lower the number on  your weekly jobless claims, the better that is as a sign of a very healthy  labor market.  These are people filing first time claims for unemployment  benefits.  </p><p>We're also getting a reading on the Philadelphia Fed Index and that came in  above expectations, 22.9 in the month of September versus an estimate of 17  points.  We got Mike Murphy standing by.  But look at these markets go, Dow  Jones Futures are up 114 points at the moment.  So we've got a rally across  the board.</p><p>This is a critical day for the market because we could, we could hit a new  all-time high, all-time closing high.  The Blue Chips, the Dow is two --  about 211 points away from its all-time closing high hit earlier this year  in January.  </p><p>Let's talk about this Mike Murphy, what do you make of these numbers?  Like  when you get the jobless claims number close to 200,000 and came in  201,000, that just tells you how healthy this job market --</p><p>MURPHY:  News flash, the economy is doing great and I think of the -- to  the people watching at home, big mistake people make I think is saying this  can't continue.  </p><p>But it can continue, there's no rule or law that says that this has to  stop.  Right now the economy is hitting on all cylinders, we're doing  great.  People have jobs, people have money to spend, that's a good thing,  it's a great time to be in the United States, it's a great time to be  investing.  Don't think the market is too high, you can still invest in the  market at these levels because of the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did President Trump tweet earlier Steve?  He's like, \"Eh,  if they don't\" -- I'm paraphrasing but, \"If you don't like your job and  they're not treating you right, go get another one because the job market  is great.\"  I just think that that's kind of the optimism that -- </p><p>FORBES:  It would be a good thing to see what it does to the housing market  if this thing last for a couple of years which it should.  People become  mobile again, that's going to be good for housing, housing market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  And when people buy homes that -- particularly  new homes, that really spreads to mini corners of the economy in terms the  building and --</p><p>FORBES:  And the very fact that people are still caution is good for the  stock market.</p><p>MURPHY:  Exactly.</p><p>FORBES:  for people to get optimistic you got to get pessimistic.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  IF it feels good, stay out.  If feels bad or cautious, get in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And on housing, you know, mortgage rates up at seven years  highs right now.  So that's one thing to keep an eye on.  </p><p>If anyone's looking to buy homes, probably a great time because as the  economy improves, would expect rates (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FORBES:  Would you do floating rates or fixed rate if you're building the  house.</p><p>MURPHY:  I would do fixed rate for certain.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  At this point with the -- I mean, you're going to put your  hands in the -- in the put your money in the hands of the Federal Reserve  or you're buying a house, I don't know, not right now.  </p><p>Thank you gentlemen.  But we want to move on to Florence's fallout, now  causing a public health hazard.  Massive flooding slamming North Carolina's  hog farm.  This is the largest concentration of hog farms in the country.</p><p>More than 5,000 of the state's hogs and pigs, dad waste lagoons, dozens of  waste lagoons overflowing causing a health hazard.  </p><p>Joining me with more to discuss this and many other topic, Health and Human  Services Secretary, former Elli Lilly Executive, Alex Azar.  Mr. Secretary,  what is HHS doing to address what is clearly a health emergency?</p><p>ALEX AZAR:  We;; the president's been showing personal leadership  throughout this.  He was just down in the Carolinas yesterday and we've  been at HHS have been working under his direction.</p><p>We pre-deployed hundreds of people into there and we're going to be there  as long as it takes to get the job done to help those in Carolina in the  situation, I'm glad to report that the hospitals are up and running,  they're on their power.  We've got most -- nursing homes are back up and  occupied and we've actually gotten every dialysis patient and the Carolina  is accounted for.</p><p>So we've got a long road to go, it's going to be a significant recovery  effort ,we'll be in for the long haul but progress is being made that's  quite good so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What kind of monitoring is HHS going to do with this?  And I  bring up the dozen -- the several dozen ways lagoons from these farms that  have overflowed because this was a really serious problem in the Carolinas.  </p><p>I believe it was -- it was almost 20 years ago after Hurricane Floyd in  1999.  And what -- how do you monitor the impacts of these kind of  environmental problems.</p><p>AZAR:  So you're right to raise that after a significant flooding event  like this.  You've got affluent runoff coming from various hog, chicken  farms that can b an issue.  You have to be checking well water as well as  public water supplies.</p><p>We have going got a significant team of an environmental response team from  the Center of Disease Control as well as the Food and Drug Administration  that is ready to deploy.  Now, the state and local governments take the  lead here but we're on standby ready to deploy and be active to a system  and anything that they need.</p><p>But we'll take our cues from the -- from the leadership in North Carolina  and South Carolina here but we've got the resources and we're ready and  you're right, it's significant and important issue of public health.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they communicating with you enough at this point?</p><p>AZAR:  Oh, very much so.  Very much so.  I cannot have been more impressed  by the leadership in South Carolina and North Carolina and our  connectivity.  We've got our teams, they're deployed with their emergency  teams. </p><p>Of course, FEMA is providing overall federal direction, we're tightly  aligned working with the president directly on this.  So no, I think  everything is work as it ought to be working in a situation like this as  catastrophic as the circumstances happen to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of the catastrophic circumstances, what is HHS doing  about the mental health issue for all of these residents of the Carolinas?   Because, again, it becomes a -- not just a physical health problem but a  mental health problem as well when people see everything that they have  ever -- that they own essentially destroyed?</p><p>AZAR:  Well you're absolutely right.  The mental health issues are ones  that we'll be dealing with in the weeks and months and even years ahead.   And that's a -- we provide significant support to the state and local  authorities there and public health providers for mental health.</p><p>That's our substance abuse mental health services agency.  We provide  significant grants and expertise to them to assist and providing mental  healthcare services and, of course, deploy our professional -- our  healthcare professionals with our -- with the FEMA emergency response teams  that are there on the ground, at the shelters, able to provide care and  counseling as we speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zack Rosenberg, the Chief of the charity organization SBPUSA.org  was on earlier and he said that he is sensing working with organizations  like FEMA and HUD, Housing in Urban Development, that there is a real  openness to true public private partnerships to make sure that A, gets to  people quickly, that the rebuilding happens quickly.</p><p>Can you speak to that within Health and Human Services particularly given  the fact that you came from the private sector.</p><p>AZAR:  Oh sure.  We -- it's vital that we be open to working with a private  sector, to provide resources.  That's one of the gray aspects of how we  work here in America and the American governmental system that we never try  to carry the burden alone from the government side but rather working in  public/private partnership and taking advantage of the tremendous goodwill  and charity of the American people who see catastrophic situation like  this.</p><p>Their heart goes out to their fellow citizens and they want to be of  assistance not just individual people but companies and organizations and  we work to facilitate that, that's one of the important missions on in our  public health service core.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to turn the opioid crisis, the Wall Street Journal has an  article titled, \"Opioid Crisis Emerges as Dominant Campaign Theme.\"  The  Department of Health and Human services granting $1 billion this week to  fight this opioid crisis.  Can you tell us where that money is going, how  it's being spend?</p><p>AZAR:  You bet.  So the president's been providing decisive leadership  here, highlighting and really making this a central issue or the country,  the opioid epidemic that is devastating so many families, so many  communities across every generation.</p><p>And just yesterday we released a $1 billion of A, the state and local  government that help provide resources for prevention, for treatment, for  recovery.  This is going to help people get into medication-assisted  treatment so they can break the cycle of addiction that's going to help  states in controlling the flow of legal and illegal opioid.  So this is  vital relief around the country for all those suffering from this massive  epidemic.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that you'll agree with this Mr. Secretary, if a  doctor tries to prescribe you opioids for the first time, you need to push  back on that.  It really starts with the individual in this country.</p><p>AZAR:  It's really important that everybody have a very detailed discussion  with their doctor about what they're being prescribed and why they're being  prescribed.  And you know, we're seeing really positive signs although we  have a long way to go.</p><p>We've seen a reduction in the prescribing rates for legal opioids, we've  seen a 264 percent increase since the president took office of Naloxone  prescriptions which are those drugs, the overdose reversing drugs and we've  seen from 2016 to 2017a 50 percent reduction in heroine use in this  country.</p><p>So we've got a long way to go, we didn't get in this overnight but we're  making progress all working together across our communities.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Secretary, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar,  thank you so much for being here.</p><p>AZAR:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Amazon Go growing, Stuart Varney, he loves to talk  about Amazon and he will do that.  What's next for the e-commerce giant?</p><p>Plus, fighting the flood, more video of this little rodent taking on a  torrential downpour inside a New York City subway.  He's just like the rest  of us who live here, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The battle for sky will be settled by auction this weekend.   Connell McShane on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey  Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, hello there  Dagen.  You know, it's interesting, this has been going on for close to two  years, 21 months to be exact between the FOX Business Network parent  company, 21st Century Fox and Comcast over who would end up with the  British broadcasters giant.</p><p>But as regulators come out and said, \"Yes, we're going to have an auction,\"  kind of unusual.  But that what they're going to do starting tomorrow  ending on Saturday.  Max three rounds of biding and we'll see who comes  away with Sky.  Market cap's $35 billion, so certainly the final number you  think would be higher than that.  </p><p>Now, before I go back to you, I also want to mention earnings today  briefly, garden restaurants of Olive Garden chain and also a number of  other restaurant chains, Longhorn Steak House, the Capital Grill and  others, $0.10 better than expected this morning.  In its most recent  quarter, $1.34 versus $1.24, stocks been red hot.  Looks like it will  continue possibly up again an all-time high this morning.</p><p>It's a 40 plus percent over the last 52 weeks and I know, I think you guys  have been following, speaking of Olive Garden Dagen, this story where they  say they're going to have a huge reveal, mysterious countdown clock that  emerge at Olive Garden, we know what it was about, it turns out Olive  Garden is issuing 10 more of its annual pasta passes in some sort of a  digital scavenger hunt.  So strong sales and bad, so the world's a better  place, I believe.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Connell.  Good to see you.  Connell McShane at  the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>Amazon now considering opening as many as 3,000 cashierless, that's cashier  free stores by 2021 according to a recent report.  Joining us now, the Host  of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  You love talking about Amazon.</p><p>STEWART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I do.  It's a brilliant  company with extraordinary power and global reach and the guy who found it,  it is now by far in a way the richest man in the world.</p><p>But what they're doing with these cashierless stores is really very  advanced.  As I understand it, now I've not been to one, they have  experiment (INAUDIBLE) you walk in the store, you put your phone against  some kind of scanner, walk around the store, takes stuff off the shelves  which you want and walk out.</p><p>Everything's scanned and looked at electronically and you get the bill on  your phone a little later.  I don't think any other retailer has anything  close to that and that may well be the way of the future.  But Dagen, I  draw your attention to a New York Times Op-Ed piece which reads as follows,  \"Why Jeff Bezos should push for nobody to get as rich as Jeff Bezos?\"</p><p>The Times is behind the lefties move to reign big tech in especially Jeff  Bezos and especially Amazon.  They're under attack but what happens if the  attacker succeed and reign in Amazon?  Do we still get this kind of  cashierless stores innovation?  My answer is no.</p><p>We've got a problem with the concentration of wealth and power that the  technology economy gives to us but we don't have an answer as to what to do  with it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know, as long as -- as long as they keep innovating I  don't see a problem with it.  And I've got an entire lexicon of hand  gestures that I would gladly teach to those tech billionaires if they would  like to communicate with the New York Times in a nonverbal way.</p><p>VARNEY:  I thought you're having a go at me there because I tend to use my  hands a little do I not?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.  I do too.  I think that we are from the same stock  if you will.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well the bottom line is that the attack is gathering steam and  it's an attack on America's technology leaders and I don't know where it's  going and I hope it fails.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Me too.  Agreement.  Stuart, thank you.  We will see you in 11  minutes time, almost.  Stuart &amp; -- Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Brett Bear is coming up with Stuart, you don't want to miss Brett with Mr.  Varney, 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday.  Three hours of Stuart straight  ahead.</p><p>But for -- up here first, talk about a tech crunch, how this snack delivery  services making a big splash in Silicon Valley, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Snacking made simple.  The tech savvy delivery service called  Snack Nation securing $12 million in Siri (INAUDIBLE) funding.  The company  founded on the idea of making healthy food more convenient than junkfood.</p><p>Joining us now the company's Co-Founder and CEO Sean Kelly.  Sean,  SnackNation, we attacked these boxes of SnackNation.  So while we eat,  please speak.</p><p>SEAN KELLY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, SNACKNATION:  Absolutely.  You want to know a  little bit about SnackNation?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Please sir.</p><p>KELLY:  All right.  We are the authority when it comes to discovering  emerging an innovative snack food brands.  And what we mean more  specifically is that we're a tech enabled snack delivery service that  delivers creations like these to thousands of companies and homes across  the country.</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Sean, you're telling me you can make  something that taste like Cheetos but it's healthier for me, right?</p><p>KELLY:  We don't necessarily make them but --</p><p>HARF:  Or deliver it, not make.</p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely, deliver.  We're go and find the best emerging and  innovative brands that's also better for you and clean delicious and bring  them direct to people.  So you can feel a little bit less bad of having the  snacks you want.</p><p>HARF:  Great.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sean, good to see you.  We are in full disclosure, Rosecliff  Ventures are proud investors in SnackNation, in Sean's business.  One thing  we look forward Dagen when we're investing in a company's strong innovative  leaders and Sean fits that bill, he's an awesome guy.</p><p>But what we love about this is they're delivering their snacks to you at  your business.  You know, we spend -- people are spending over eight hours  a day at work and employers want to make sure that their employees have an  opportunity to eat healthy while they're at work.</p><p>But one thing we love that I love to hear Sean speak about is the data that  they're able to collect.  When they send this box to you at work, what  you're getting out of that Sean?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  In today's world it's so important to be able to continually  iterate and innovate, right, especially if you're a big CPG company.  So  what we do is we go direct to the consumer, have a direct relationship with  them at their most engage moments.</p><p>We collect consumer insights and data that we see back o the brands so they  can better understand their customer and therefore improve their products.   We also use all that data to determine what emerging brands are going to  win tomorrow.  So we have a little bit of a predictive analytics engine  that gives us a leg up in this business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you sell that -- the new -- do you take that new data and  sell it?</p><p>KELLY:  We do.  We sell that actually back to brands and there's also  different ways for us to work with industry leaders and big CPGs to deliver  some of that information to them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So are you growing -- so this is direct to individuals but also  companies.</p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely.  So we started on the enterprise, the reason that we  started, we don't really look at B2B and B2C as being different.  It's all  about just where the consumer is and today's business --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Business-to-business and business-to-consumer.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's from -- that's from the first.com bubble by the way.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  Well that's the -- we like -- we like afternoons.  But  for us it's like, \"Why did you -- why did start at the office?  It's  because it's where the younger generation spends the most time.</p><p>HARF:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  And so for us there's not that much difference.  But being able to  collect these insights and (INAUDIBLE) will have a forward-looking view in  terms of what's going to work and what's not is really important.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I attack this box like I hadn't eaten for the last five  weeks and there -- we're immediately plant-base options in these boxes, not  --</p><p>KELLY:  Well based on a plan that's not going away</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not -- you know, I don't eat any animal products at all.   But it is -- but it goes to also.  </p><p>If you're dealing with corporate customers, if they're trying to make their  entire workforce healthy and keep their healthcare cost down, that's a huge  selling point.</p><p>FORBES:  It's nice with chocolate chip cookies that are healthy and taste  like chocolate chip cookie.</p><p>HARF:  We also have pizza too.</p><p>MURPHY:  To wash down the pizza.  </p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely.  Lenny &amp; Larry's pack of protein, Steve, those are good  for the guns, good for the biceps.</p><p>FORBES:  I'm getting ready for the Olympics.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sean, real quick, is there -- so with this platform, is there  anything after snacks that could next for SnackNation?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  So we're actually setting this up as a platform where we can  really deliver any consumer products through this.  So even though our  focus is on snacks, is in -- by the way, snacks can be anything.</p><p>Seventy percent Americans say that anything can be a snack as long as it's  in a convenient format.  And so we're already starting to plug health and  beauty items and other items to our consumer insights final.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- here's a tip --</p><p>FORBES:  Wow.  Sounds like a mini Amazon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- here's a tip, cauliflower and cassava flour  crackers, there you go, they're delicious.  </p><p>KELLY:  Love -- I love casara -- cassava, it's great for anti-inflammatory.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  And Sean Kelly, great of you to be here.  Please  come back sir.</p><p>KELLY:  Thanks so much, appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nice to see you.</p><p>KELLY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The flood rat next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd say thank you and so long to Marie, Mike, and the fabulous  Steve Forbes and we hope that flood rat's OK.

I'm John Vause and this is Newsroom L.A.</p><p>It was barely a month ago when the U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was proclaiming that he and <person><nameText>North Korea's Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>would try to make their upcoming summit a special moment for world peace.</p><p>Now, the White House seems to be trying to tamp down expectations. Even the president is saying the June 12th talks are going to be more of a get to know you situation.</p><p>Here's CNN's Jim Sciutto.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: From the moment the president first suggested a summit with the North Korean leader, his goal had been ambitious and clear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>U.S. PRESIDENT: If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: This last week as he met in New York with his North Korea counterpart, <person><nameText>Secretary of State </nameText></person><person><nameText>Mike Pompeo, </nameText></person>reiterated the president's intentions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE POMPEO, </nameText></person>U.S. <person><nameText>SECRETARY OF STATE</nameText></person>: The complete verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: No longer. Now the goal of the June 12th meeting in Singapore, just a meet and greet between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and North Korean <person><nameText>leader Kim Jong-un, </nameText></person>this according to a source familiar with the discussions.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said the same publically on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's really a get to know you kind of a situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: The plan, a source tells CNN, is to come to a broad agreement on North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Then negotiations would be handed over to <person><nameText>Secretary Pompeo </nameText></person>for discussions that could take years.</p><p>This, even as the U.S. still has received no assurances that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE POMPEO, </nameText></person>U.S. <person><nameText>SECRETARY OF STATE</nameText></person>: I believe they are contemplating a path for where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before. This will obviously be their decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: With a downgraded agenda, there is concern growing in Congress that this summit is just for show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED MARKEY, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT: We're not going to extract concessions by made-for-TV diplomacy by the photo op that Kim wants, and I think that Trump wants as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: Often before summits like this, there is a managing of expectations. In this case, really a massive downgrading of expectations, and not the outside world's, but the president's own expectations for this summit described as recently as last week.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCIUTTO: Going from a summit where the goal is to have a major agreement, or getting close to a major agreement, to as the president said himself, \"a meet and greet\" to build the relationship.</p><p>Jim Sciutto, CNNWashington.</p><p>VAUSE: CNN's International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, joins us now live from Seoul in South Korea.</p><p>And, Nic, this is a summit light on details from everything to where the two leaders will actually meet when they get to Singapore, to you know the big stuff, like who will cover the costs of dismantling North Korea's nuclear program, which one study has put at $20 billion.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It seems they're going to have a lot of time to save up that $20 billion, doesn't it John? Because at the moment, as you said, the tangible detail just doesn't exist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>It's all aspirational and at the moment, you know <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>really does see himself, it appears, coming here really just to show Kim that he's willing and this is the man who he'll be doing business with, but let's not worry about the details, let's leave that to other people.</p><p>The timeframe here, even you know from what the state department is saying the (inaudible) of the president's first term of office at least. So, their creating an expectation here that this won't even be an issue come the next presidential elections. It really is long-term stuff, without articulating really even what they get to at the end of that, John.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: And, the White House continues to insist, on Monday, that the maximum pressure campaign on North Korea through very tough international sanctions would continue. Even though the president said last week he wanted to avoid that kind of language, because everyone was getting on now.</p><p>But after the summit, how realistic is it to expect countries like China to stay on board?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Sure. Look, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has shown his hand here. He was very bellicose, very loud, calling <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>\"little rocket man\", \"mad man\", things like that last year. That had everyone worried to the point that they were prepared, because they though <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>might do something like start a war and it was worth increasing sanctions.</p><p>[01:05] It convinced the Chinese leadership, it convinced many other people and <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>among them. It worked, it got those tougher sanctions, it's gotten Kim to the table.</p><p>But now, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has really shown that he just want to kind of go this alone with <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un, </nameText></person>a photo op really at the beginning, not clear what comes after that.</p><p>This has given China, Russia and others an opportunity to realize, okay, now we wait for our own best interests. We recognize that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>isn't - - the bluster is kind of empty, really, as far as they can see so far. So, let's follow our own national security interests and let's begin to sort of see what deals are out there.</p><p>So, for China, what would be the rationale for them to sign up back to tough sanctions? Now they know it might not be in their interests, because <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is looking for a deal in him own interest. Plus, there's a trade war, potentially looming, between the <person><nameText>United States </nameText></person>and China; the good will's gone, the cards are played.</p><p>So, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>may find it very hard to - - to - - to recalibrate and bring back a maximum pressure type situation.</p><p>VAUSE: It could end up being quite an expensive handshake between these two men at the end of the day, but I guess we'll see.</p><p>Nic, thank you.</p><p>Nic Robertson, live for us there in Seoul.</p><p>For more on this now, we're joined by our political commentator's Democratic strategist, Dave Jacobson, and Republican consultant, John Thomas.</p><p>So, as we get closer to the summit, the White House continues to sort of walk back expectations bigly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>According to CNN's reporting, \"Trump and his aides have suggested the most concrete product of the June 12th encounter could be a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War\" - - which would not be a bad thing, \"a far cry from the commitment to immediate denuclearization that the administration once insisted would be required for Trump to come to the table\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: So, John, is it possible that maybe the president just overhyped what was possible, what could be achieved at this summit and maybe he didn't understand the complexity of nuclear negotiation? JOHN THOMAS, REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT: I'm sure he didn't fully understand the complexity, but I wouldn't - - I think just saying that this is a photo op and a hand shake thing, I - - I - - I think that's underplaying what's going to come out of it.</p><p>I think we may see some serious progress here, but the other side of the coin is the president shouldn't say that we have to make a deal or else, because that's giving up a key point of leverage here.</p><p>So, to say that he might just shake hands and walk away, I think is a part of a broader positioning game against North Korea, not just politically positioning for U.S. politics.</p><p>VAUSE: But, Dave, we talk about leverage and positioning and all that kind of stuff, there seems to be a stunning lack of up-front commitments coming from Pyongyang ahead of this summit. And, you know the language continues to soften on the U.S. side.</p><p>DAVE JACOBSON, CNN POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Yes, because if <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>is going to get a meeting with the president of the free world, essentially, that elevates him. That's a massive score for his country, right?</p><p>In a way that we haven't seen in modern times and if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>fails to deliver anything meaningful beyond a hand shake, or perhaps just some dialog, but nothing tangible in terms of a deal for denuclearization, I think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to look like a failure, because it is an expectations game.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is the one who didn't want the meeting, that wanted the meeting, that didn't want the meeting, now we're having the meeting again, like, something's got to get done and if he doesn't, it's going to be a big failure.</p><p>VAUSE: Although, John, I'm just wondering if that photo op will be enough? People will see the photograph shaking hands with <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>and you know, in a busy world, if you don't have a lot of time for details, they'll just think, \"Hey, he did it\".</p><p>THOMAS: Perhaps public opinion that day, but it doesn't do anything to make us more safe, and I think South Korea's not going to be pleased with just a hand shake. So, he has to start to get something done. I don't know that he has to get something massively, or bigly, done that day, but there has to be something in motion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I also think what we're seeing differently with the Trump administration, we're seeing diplomacy play out on Twitter. I mean, this is something that . . .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>But, usually the making of the sausage is something we're not privy to, so the back and forth - - when deals are being made, although there's a high stakes deal, deals die a thousand deaths often times before they get made, we just don't see them die all those deaths. This time we're actually living it.</p><p>VAUSE: Is that a good thing, Dave?</p><p>JACOBSON: I don't think so. I mean look at the juxtaposition, right? You've got <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>engaging with the North Koreans over Twitter, and then alienating our allies in Canada and Mexico, or the E.U. with the supposed trade war. I mean, it's unprecedented in conversation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: Okay. Well, the new normal, Trump's former campaign chairman could be heading to jail. Prosecutors are trying to revoke his house arrest, accusing him of witness tampering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Saying Paul Manafort repeatedly contacted two people who worked and previously assisted in his lobbying and public relations efforts for Ukrainian politicians. Manafort sought to secure materially false testimony concerning activities of an influential group of European leaders called the Hapsburg group, that Manafort once used to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: As for the president, even before this news broke, he was throwing Manafort under the bus tweeting this, \"Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a very short period of time, he represented Ronald Regan, Bob Dole and many others over the years, but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: John, so somehow this is the fault of the former FBI Director, James Comey? Does this president take responsibility for anything?</p><p>THOMAS: It's a difficult thing. I mean . . .</p><p>JACOBSON: Translation - - no.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>THOMAS: No, no, no it's a difficult road, because I think the president, if he had been told by the FBI, I don't think he would have hired Manafort.</p><p>He hired Manafort because he thought he wasn't going to win the convention, he needed somebody who knew how to whip votes, and Roger Stone told him hey, Manafort's done this before and he brought him right in. But, just to say it's the FBI's fault, I mean that doesn't make sense.</p><p>Btu, remember all of these things that Paul is getting nailed for - - it's not about his role in the campaign and Russian collusion, yet. But, I'm just saying all of these news tightening tactics are bad actions that Paul's taken in his private business life, not campaign maneuvers.</p><p>VAUSE: And what this all means for the possibility of Manafort getting a pardon remains unclear, but the president has no doubts about himself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Tweeting this, \"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to pardon\" - - in all caps, \"myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats\" - - they're actually Republicans, \"and others continues into the mid- terms\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: And, Dave, the president also described the appointment of the special counsel as unconstitutional, which seems to suggest he doesn't really understand what's in the Constitution.</p><p>JACOBSON: Right, and like the special counsel, is a Republican.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>But, look, if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was innocent, if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>did nothing wrong, or his campaign did nothing wrong, then why would he say that the president can't obstruct justice? Why would he say that he can pardon himself? Why would his lawyers say that they're not going to have him testify before Bob Mueller?</p><p>Clearly, there's something there. They're clearly hiding something. The question is what? And whether or not Bob Mueller's going to find that evidence and use it against the president? Right? But, why is going there, if he hasn't anything to hide?</p><p>VAUSE: It does look a little odd. John?</p><p>THOMAS: Well, I think the president and his attorneys are just trying to protect him from a perjury trap. I think the president knows that there was no Russian collusion, he said it a thousand times. There has yet to be any evidence produced to date, other than processed crimes related to some of these Papadopoulos' and others, showing Russian collusion.</p><p>But, when you get - - it's like Chuck Schumer said if the FBI wants to get you, they have six different ways to Sunday to get you.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, this first claim was made by Trump's lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that basically Trump could pardon himself and that brought out two very different responses from two Republican Senators. First, here's Chuck Grassley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK GRASSLEY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR: If I were the President of the <person><nameText>United States </nameText></person>and I had a lawyer that told me I could pardon myself, I think I'd hire a new lawyer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And, now what was truly a priceless moment from Ted Cruz.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Senator, the president says he can pardon himself. Would you agree with that?</p><p>(PAUSE) TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN SENATOR: That is not a Constitutional issue I've studied, so I will withhold judgment at this point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: John, it took him 18 seconds to come up with that dodge and that's the best he could come up with? Seriously, he has no opinion on this? He's a lawyer. I mean, this is his thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMAS: I think we need to look back at when Giuliani made those statements on what 'Meet the Press'? He looks off to the side and laughs like well I suppose he could pardon himself, but he never would because the public opinion would immediately impeach him. So, we're running off on this idea of whether or not he has the power . . .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>But even Giuliani was like, if the guy ever thought about doing that, he'd be immediately impeached.</p><p>VAUSE: Dave, what is incredibly you know astounding about Cruz, and his willingness to carry water for this president, is that during the campaign Trump essentially called his wife ugly and said his father played a role in the assassination of JFK. I mean, the list goes on and yet Ted Cruz continues to sort of lay down for <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>JACOBSON: I think it's largely a function that Senator Cruz is up for reelection and he is trying to you know avoid alienating the Trump slice of the electorate, and prevent them from staying home in the upcoming general elections.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>But, he wants to be a Senator. He wants to have - - he probably has future presidential ambitions and so he needs to be reelected in order to like put himself on that trajectory, right? And so, I think the challenge is will those Trump voters stay home, if he goes after the president.</p><p>[01:15] But look, it's not just Ted Cruz, you've got like Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, today, came out and said they would have catastrophic implications. Chris Christie, the former Republican Governor, who also campaigned against <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>said that it was outrageous to even think about whether or not <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>can pardon himself.</p><p>So, there are some Republicans splitting from him, but I agree at the end of the day, like we need those Ted Cruz's of the world to stand up to the president.</p><p>VAUSE: Giuliani did actually try to walk back that original statement a few hours ago, while appearing on CNN with Chris Cuomo. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: I said very theoretically the answer is the president can't be prosecuted for anything. There's a Constitutional remedy for that, and of course that would be entirely ridiculous.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Right, but you could have made the point . . .</p><p>GIULIANI: It was a hypothetical that you would entertain in a law school and that's what I tried to say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: The only problem is it's not a hypothetical situation because the president is facing legal jeopardy here, and it's a very real possibility that he is actually possibly thinking about pardoning himself. And, what many have said, and it's not a slam dunk that he can do it, because there is an opinion out there that the president is not above the law.</p><p>THOMAS: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: Is the president above the law? In this country, can he do whatever he wants?</p><p>THOMAS: No, he can't, but at the same time in the course of doing his job, he can essentially do what he wants. If he wants to fire people, he can fire people and his justification that he wants to fire them is pretty much all it takes. But, he is held accountable, or can be held accountable, by the Congress.</p><p>Giuliani's problem is he is straddling this weird world where he's a spokesperson, but he's an attorney and he wants to answer as an attorney sometimes, but a disciplined messenger at others. And, it's just weird moment - - he keeps stepping in it . . .</p><p>VAUSE: He keeps stepping on rakes.</p><p>THOMAS: Right. They're self-inflicted.</p><p>VAUSE: Totally.</p><p>Okay. Let's finish up here with the president starting a very public feud with the Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles. He cancelled their trip to the White House, this is traditional for the winners to go there. It was cancelled because a few players decided not to go and they let that be known long before the invitations went out, but here is the latest Trump Tweet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>\"The Philadelphia Eagles football team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry.\"</p><p>VAUSE: Here's a statement in response to the you know the invitation being rescinded from the mayor of Philadelphia, \"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Dave, this is a fight the president clearly wants to have because it appeals to his base, but why does he get to decide the definition of patriotism?</p><p>JACOBSON: He doesn't. I mean, this is by the way, another example of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>like changing the conversation away. Like, he should be talking about his 500 days and if I'm a Republican, my tax cuts and all these great things that I've done as <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>He's trying to change the conversation away from that, which I just don't get. What I found fascinating, though, was the mayor of Philadelphia, his chief of staff put out this Tweet today basically showing this juxtaposition of you know, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>inauguration photo, versus, after the Eagles won the Super Bowl - - we've got more fans than you do, which I thought was fun.</p><p>VAUSE: So, John, clearly you know this is a fight the president could have avoided. But, he jumped in boots and all. He loves this stuff and he sees it in his interest, but maybe not in the country's interest?</p><p>THOMAS: Well, politically he won the last fight. He's going to win this again. He understands this is an opportunity to do an \"us versus them\" saying the American flag is bigger than the NFL, and it is, and it has been and it is a wedge.</p><p>And so, look, I think it's actually smart politics of the president and he's being consistent on this message, and anytime he has an opportunity to double down on it, he will and he'll win again.</p><p>VAUSE: Smart politics, Dave, but is it good for the country?</p><p>JACOBSON: No, it's further dividing the country. I mean, this president, ever since the inception of his campaign has divided the country. So, he's doing the complete opposite of that and I think that's the challenge is you've got these NFL players that are saying, you know, we've got a racist and a bigot in the White House, and I'm not going to step foot in it as long as <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>the president.</p><p>VAUSE: Which is their right?</p><p>JACOBSON: Yes, they're expressing their First Amendment right, absolutely. But, I think the challenge is the president's supposed to be the bigger person, right? The president is supposed to invite these national champions to come in, whether they agree with him politically or not, and be the bigger person and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>isn't capable of doing that.</p><p>VAUSE: It's also the people's house, it's not a Trump property, just FYI.</p><p>THOMAS: But, it's not about bowing down to Trump, it's about standing for the American flag. It's a whole different thing.</p><p>VAUSE: You have the last word.</p><p>[01:20] THOMAS: But this, as you say, Trump's been dividing, he's actually been standing up to unite us saying we can disagree politically, but in this moment for the National Anthem, we should be proud to be an American, put that first.</p><p>JACOBSON: I don't remember <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>ever saying that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks, Dave. Thanks, John.</p><p>Okay. Well, still to come, many in Guatemala say their relatives have been buried alive when a volcano erupted suddenly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Engulfing villages in lava and thick clouds of ash, and throwing rocks. More on that in a moment.</p><p>Also ahead, Apple shows off its newest bells and whistles as the company value inches closer to a major trillion dollar milestone.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: The Kilauea volcano is not letting up on Hawaii, the lava has now destroyed at least 117 homes in the past month alone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And, it's covering more than 2,000 acres of land. There were about 500 tremors in the summit area over the weekend and a river of lava has entered the ocean at another base, sending a dangerous mix of acid and volcanic glass particles into the air.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: When Guatemala's Fuego volcano roared back to life without notice on Sunday, it spewed rivers of lava.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And, these huge clouds of debris, burning rocks and volcanic ash, and hot gas. The deluge buried entire families, killing at least 69 people, but that death toll is believed that it will rise.</p><p>CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Guatemala's volcano of fire is living up to its name, after a deadly explosion that killed dozens of people, many more are wounded or are missing. It all began on Sunday when really out of nowhere, this active volcano that has not exploded for months - - has not caused any fatalities in quite some time, suddenly came alive.</p><p>Rivers of lava came pouring down the volcano, people did not have time to flee the lava or the flying rocks that many of the village were on fire and damaged homes, whole towns were wiped out. Even now, rescuers are having a hard time reaching many of these small towns/</p><p>People said that the people who came down the mountains were covered in ash, many of them were dazed, so they barely escaped with their lives and were worried about where their relatives are.</p><p>Guatemala's main airport was closed for several hours, has reopened, although some flights are cancelled. Ash has been seen as far away as Guatemala City and in El Salvador. Really, much of this region is still responding to this deadly, deadly tragedy, many more are feared dead.</p><p>[01:25] Guatemala is now in a state of mourning - - three days of mourning, and officials are concerned that more eruptions could be on the way.</p><p>Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera joins us now with more on the ongoing threats from the volcano and how the weather could play a role in all of this.</p><p>Ivan.</p><p>IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, we'll be talking about some rain over the next couple of days and that's I think going to add additional problems here to what is already a calamity, the likes of which they haven't seen in this area, and from this particular volcano, in 40 years. Yes, it had an eruption earlier this year, but obviously nothing like what we had on this Sunday.</p><p>So, here's what's happening. We have a seasonal rainy pattern, right? Typical for this time of year in Guatemala to get very heavy rain, tropical downpours, especially through the afternoon hours. That is problematic because when rain mixes with ash, that's when we start getting in lahars - - and I'll talk about that in a second.</p><p>But, another thing that officials have been warning about as well, because of all the ash that is in the area, contamination of water supplies could be an issue over the next several days.</p><p>This is Mt. Saint Helen's, not our volcano there in Guatemala, but I'm showing you this picture because I think it really gives you a good idea of what we're talking about here, and that's just a word for mudflow, a violent one, in fact, it only occurs when you mix in water.</p><p>So, talk about tropical downpours mixing in with that volcanic ash, you could set up a violent mudflow that can essentially go through riverbeds, can be as deep as meters and also moving rather fast at around 20 to 40 kilometers per hour.</p><p>We've seen some of those mudflows, some of those lahars destroy entire communities here. So, we're going to have to watch this very closely over the next few days. Why?</p><p>Because of this. We have heavy rain that's going to be on the way, not just tomorrow or the next day, John, but this is going to be an ongoing threat, I think, really right through the upcoming days, each and every day, very heavy rain on the way for the area.</p><p>VAUSE: Okay. That brings the problem with mudslides and a whole bunch of other stuff.</p><p>Ivan, thank you.</p><p>Well, for the first time Saudi Arabia has issued drivers licenses to women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Three weeks before a ban on female drivers is expected to end.

But, the U.N. is condemning the recent arrests of at least 11 women and rights activists, some of whom remain behind bars accused of undermining the Kingdom's security.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Still to come here. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in the case of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>But, the broader debate about religious freedom is far from over.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:30:18] VAUSE,: Welcome back everybody.</p><p>You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>A source tells CNN the Kim (ph) and Trump (ph) summit between U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and North Korean <person><nameText>leader Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>will be more of a meet and greet and that the goal is a broad agreement on nuclear disarmament the details of which could still take years to negotiate.</p><p>At least 69 people were killed after Guatemala's Fuego Volcano erupted Sunday with sudden speed and ferocity. It spewed rivers of lava and these huge clouds of burning rocks and volcanic ash as well as hot gas. The death toll is expected to rise as a number of families are missing.</p><p>Anti-austerity protests in Jordan have led to the resignation of Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki. But demonstrators plan to keep up the pressure until a proposed income tax reform is scrapped. The International Monetary Fund supported the law (ph) aimed at cutting Jordan's massive public debt. King Abdullah has tapped a former World Bank economist to form a new government.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple. Jack Phillips said it was against his religious beliefs. And the couple accused him of violating anti- discrimination laws.</p><p>But in a very specific ruling the Court said the state of Colorado showed hostility towards Phillips based on his beliefs. The Court did not settle the larger constitutional question of religious liberty versus discrimination.</p><p>Well criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool joins me now for more on this. It's good to see you -- Brian. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hey -- John. Yes, thanks.</p><p>VAUSE: It was interesting. This case was litigated over grounds of freedom of speech but at the end of the day the opinion written by Justice Kennedy seemed to sort of address the problem of bias -- remember the case was initially heard by Colorado's Civil Rights Commission.</p><p>Kennedy wrote that one commissioner had crossed the line when he said freedom of religion has been used just like all kinds of discrimination throughout history whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and mutual enforcement of Colorado's anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>But overall it seems, the Court made it fairly clear that the states are allowed to force businesses, whatever that business is, whether it's a cake shop or anything else, that they have to serve all customers -- gays, lesbians, everyone -- which I guess in the big picture here the cake shop owner he may have won the battle but he loses the war.</p><p>CLAYPPOOL: Yes John -- in my opinion the U.S. Supreme Court punted. This was a great opportunity for the Court to rule on the clash between faith and first amendment rights and discrimination.</p><p>And instead of reaching an opinion that addressed that issue they used, in my opinion, a collateral issue to rule on this. By collateral, what I mean is well, one of the Civil Rights Commission members made a comment about religion --</p><p>VAUSE: And religious beliefs --</p><p>CLAYPOOL: -- yes, religious beliefs being used as a propeller for discrimination. But that wasn't really the issue here. The issue to me was whether these, the bakers -- Jack Phillips, the baker -- whether he was losing his right, his belief in religion, and his first amendment right at the expense of discrimination?</p><p>VAUSE: Why do you think they punted?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: They didn't want to rule on this issue.</p><p>VAUSE: Why?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: It is a tough issue. Let's break it down for example. The first issue that I talk about is whether baking a cake is even protected by the First Amendment. We haven't even talked about that. You know, I would argue as a civil rights lawyer, too, that it is not.</p><p>The reason why is these bakers have a right to go out and protest. They could still argue against gay rights. And in fact, these bakers, they declined the gay couple before they even talked about the creative aspect of the cake. So in my opinion the cake is not even first amendment.</p><p>But even if it is, you then have to look at an issue of whether that somehow squares with the law. You mentioned it. There is a law, John -- there is a law in Colorado. It makes it categorically clear that you cannot discriminate against someone based on sexual orientation. And clearly that's what I think happened here.</p><p>VAUSE: David Cole -- excuse me -- he represented the gay couple. He wrote an op-ed in the \"Washington Post\", and that's his opinion, that Colorado's Commission's ruling -- initial ruling was well within the law. He wrote \"The commission's statement that one cannot invoke religion to harm others is actually black-letter constitutional law as is the notion that one cannot invoke religion to avoid complying with the general rule requiring businesses not to discriminate based on the Supreme Court itself did just that in the 1990 Employment Division versus Smith case.\"</p><p>So even if the commission was biased in some way or one commissioner held these beliefs and was sort of biased -- what does that matter if the decision is still within the law?</p><p>[01:35:00] CLAYPOOL: You're absolutely right. The Supreme Court using the bias of the commission is a complete cop-out.</p><p>The fact of the matter is this. In 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. So are you telling me that gays can legally marry but yet they can walk into a bakery now and they can be discriminated against?</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Those two principles are at odds. And that's why I think this Supreme Court did not want to address this issue square on.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Well, there was this bigger question about discrimination versus religious freedom. And the Court -- part of the opinion is this. \"It is a general rule that religious and philosophical objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a mutual and generally- applicable public accommodations law.\"</p><p>Ok. So having that there -- having said that now, if Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the couple who wanted the cake, if they turned up back at the master -- what is it -- Masterpiece Cake Shop, placed the same order. Is it true to say that the owner Jack Phillips he would not have a first amendment right to turn them away at this point? Or is that still yet to be settled?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: No. It hasn't been settled.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Here's what I would do. This is what I would recommend. I recommend that a gay -- any gay couple walk into the same bakery tomorrow and they order a wedding cake, and have Jack Phillips deny the cake and then let's have a commission in Colorado not make these comments --</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: -- about discrimination, religion being used as discrimination. Have them be on the up and up, issue their ruling and then that forces the U.S. Supreme Court then to really come to head with this issue.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. And in fact, the governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper said that, you know, that's what they'll be looking at with this commission. There was some soaring language in this opinion piece by Kennedy when it comes to the recognition of gay rights.</p><p>How society comes to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the constitution can and in some instances must protect them and the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.\"</p><p>You know, so you've got this opinion here which seems to be at odds with the ultimate decision siding with the owner of the cake shop. At the end of the day, given what he has written here, if there is another case that goes forward how much weigh does that sort of stuff carry.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, it's not going to carry as much weight.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Here is what's going to happen. This is going to come up again --</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: -- in the very near future. And we're not going to have any excuse for the Supreme Court to avoid making a decision that's based on the real issues.</p><p>We don't have a ruling today -- John, based on the real issues because the first amendment does not give you a right to violate the law. And that's exactly what happened here. You can't come up with some religious idea that all of a sudden, it is against my religion --</p><p>VAUSE: To serve black people --</p><p>CLAYPOOL: -- what about white people? And of a sudden, all white people go into a bakery can't get a cake? That just is squarely at odds with the fundamentals in our society -- of civil rights, constitutional rights.</p><p>VAUSE: And as you say, it was a great chance to resolve this issue. And forever whatever that is -- I guess it will be settled one way or the other.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: We're going to see this again where the cake is going to clash with faith. That's going to happen again. We're going to see it soon.</p><p>VAUSE: You can't have your faith cake and eat your cake -- you know, I guess we'll find out.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think so.</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks -- Brian.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: All right. Thanks for having me -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Pleasure.</p><p>Next here on NEWSROOM L.A., Apple's CEO talks cell phone addiction and what a trade war with China could mean for the cost of an iPhone. [01:38:39] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back everybody.</p><p>Apple is on the verge of becoming the first trillion-dollar company as executives showed off the newest software upgrades on Monday Apple stock rose again pushing it closer to that milestone. CEO Tim Cook sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall about Apple's future.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Hey there.</p><p>Well, a lot of excitement today. You have over 5,000 developers here for the developer conference. This is where we hear a lot about the latest features we'll see on our phone in the next coming months.</p><p>One feature in particular that was really interesting and almost unexpected was a tech addiction tool. It's aimed at helping us use our phones less and taking control back. It's called Screen Time.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down with Tim cook who cares a lot about tech and humanity and spoke to me specifically about this. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: You guys announced a tech addiction tool that will almost help us limit our screen time. So what is the thinking behind that?</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Well you know, we've never been focused on usage as a key parameter. We want people to be incredibly satisfied and empowered by our devices that we ship (ph). But we've never wanted people to spend a lot of time on them or all of their time on them.</p><p>And you know, it is a personal thing as to how much is too much. We thought a lot about this and we're rolling out great tools to both make people aware of how much time they're spending and the apps that they're spending them in but also how many times they pick up their point. How many notifications they get? Who is sending them the notifications?</p><p>SEGALL: So tell me about your own tech habits.</p><p>COOK: Yes. I've been using it and I have to tell you I thought I was fairly disciplined about this. And I was wrong. When I began to get the data, I found I was spending a lot more time than I should.</p><p>SEGALL: Like where?</p><p>COOK: Well, I don't want to give you all the apps but just too much. And the number of times I picked up the phone were too many.</p><p>SEGALL: What do you tell people who are worried they're addicted to their smart phones who are worried about tech's impact on children? COOK: I think ultimately, each person has to make the decision when they get their numbers as to what they would like to do. And I encourage everyone to look and everyone to make an informed decision and ask themselves if they're picking up their phone 10 times an hour or 20 times an hour maybe they could do it less.</p><p>I think the power is now shifted to the user. And that's just been what Apple has always been about is giving the power from the institution to the user.</p><p>SEGALL: It's so interesting because there is this idea, who is control? Man or machine. You believe that we as human beings, we can control --</p><p>COOK: I absolutely do. I don't subscribe to the machines taking over the world. And I don't worry about that. I worry much more about people thinking like machines than machines thinking like people.</p><p>SEGALL: What do you mean? That's interesting. What do you mean?</p><p>COOK: I mean forgetting the humanity in things, forgetting that all of our products should be infused with humanity.</p><p>SEGALL: I get the sense that that feels very personal to you -- what you just said.</p><p>COOK: It does.</p><p>SEGALL: Why?</p><p>COOK: Because it's the reason I'm on the face of the earth. It makes it really personal, right that this is the role I play.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?</p><p>COOK: Generally, for me I'm not a big fan of regulation. I think self-regulation is the best. But when it's not working and in some cases it's not work, you have to ask yourself so what form of regulation might be good?</p><p>[01:45:01] SEGALL: What kind do you think isn't working?</p><p>COOK: Well, I think that the privacy thing has gotten totally out of control. And I think most people are not aware of who is tracking them, how much they're being tracked, and sort of the large amounts of detailed data that are out there about them.</p><p>SEGALL: Do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy? Is it a luxury at this point?</p><p>COOK: No. To me -- and we feel this very deeply -- we think privacy a fundamental human right. So that is the angle that we look at it. Privacy from an American point of view is one of these key civil liberties that's define what it is to be American.</p><p>SEGALL: It's a fundamental human right. Do you think the last year has shown that that fundamental human right could be under attack?</p><p>COOK: I think it has been under attack.</p><p>SEGALL: Just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple. As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?</p><p>COOK: Well, I haven't read the opinion and so I reserve the right to read that and deeply understand. It was very prominent (ph).</p><p>But in terms of the general topic, we believe that everybody should treat everybody else with dignity and respect. And that's how we run our company. That's what we expect of each other and that pertains to all communities including the LGBTQ community.</p><p>SEGALL: I know that there is this fear (ph) -- the impact on consumers and will iPhone prices go up if there's an escalated trade war? I'd be curious to know -- I know you said you're optimistic before. Are you still optimistic?</p><p>COOK: I am. I am very optimistic because no one will win from that. It will be a lose-lose.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you think that if that were to occur, that iPhone prices could go up?</p><p>COOK: I don't think that iPhone will get a tariff on it is my belief. Based on what I've been told and what I see, I just don't see that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: And here at this conference, you have developers from over 70 different countries. So immigration is in the DNA of Apple. It is why you'll hear Tim speak very openly about immigration practices. And you know, at a very fascinating moment in time and technology where we're talking about tech addiction, we're talking about privacy and politics because at this moment, technology is the underlayer to society.</p><p>And you very much see the CEO looking to step into a role to just go beyond, you know, just tech's impact on this whole feature (ph) but also on society. He said, you know, he feels a much larger obligation. He says it's why he's here on this earth.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>VAUSE: Laurie Segall -- thank you for that.</p><p>Global business executive Bryan Patel joins me for more now on Apple and the rise and rise of the Apple stock.</p><p>Well, it's interesting Apple opened its annual conference for developers on Monday and the stock price actually went up. (INAUDIBLE) a historical trend it was only going down over the last 14, 15 years. The stock closed at $191.83 was up almost 1 percent. But to reach this magic tree in dollar mark, it is kind of a little iffy, you know. But basically the stock price reached somewhere around $202.30. So given, you know, what we know of Apple, its performance, you know, the last couple years -- what is that a matter of weeks, a matter of months. I mean how long before we get there? $60 billion come on -- how hard is that.</p><p>BRYAN PATEL, GLOBAL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: Listen -- I think that's underestimated. Everyone thinks like, you know we're joking about it. But I think -- they're going to get to the $60 billion mark.</p><p>It wasn't until a few years ago where analysts were going after them saying where's your new product? Where's your new product. This is going to go down.</p><p>What has changed is their service? People are focusing on things at their higher margin items and they've kind of diversified to some other different things. So I believe -- I think they're going to get there probably faster than the competitors or anyone else nearby. And I think they've been really smart of how they've been growing their platform.</p><p>VAUSE: The most important issue I guess isn't really when Apple reaches this milestone. It's just a number. At the end of the day it doesn't mean a whole lot. What is far more important is essentially, you know, how is the company run as you say? Can it continue to grow? Can it continue to produce revenue?</p><p>PATEL: Well, here's the thing. We kind of joke about how the Apple Watches didn't really go off with a hitch. But you think about, you know, the air pods, right? High margins, high in demand --</p><p>VAUSE: They forced everyone to get them because they got rid of the jack. It wasn't really innovation.</p><p>PATEL: Wall Street loves what -- service models. They love money and they love companies --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PATEL: Apple has transformed themselves, not just to be a hardware company.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>PATEL: And they moved toward this so that means their valuation and the potential higher up is going to go.</p><p>Now, they didn't invent the wireless head phone but they are finding ways for you to have it stay in with the Apple family. It's no different from some other companies like Amazon and right that's what they've done too.</p><p>VAUSE: It's very clever stuff which basically if Apple gets to this trillion-dollar mark, if it was a country it would have the 17th biggest economy in the world, which is kind of terrifying to think that you know, this company has that much power. [01:49:58] How much though is that to do with the nature of the stock market today? With, you know, surging prices -- and you know, is it simply that, you know, trillion-dollar companies are just not that special? It's something to be expected in this, you know, current set up.</p><p>PATEL: You know, I hate to say yes because I think they've worked -- I think out of all the companies, Apple has gotten a lot of scrutiny over the last few years to get to where they got to and to get to that number is a special number. But yes.</p><p>I think you're expecting, you are always expecting what are they doing next? How they streamline things? There's always going to be behind them, right. And I think know we're focusing, ok, $1 trillion -- we're not even there yet, we're already going --</p><p>VAUSE: Big deal.</p><p>PATEL: Big deal, who's next.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, I guess because back in the 1980s IBM, you know, this huge company that now is pretty much nothing. It has already been broken up and sold off. It had 60 percent of the S&amp;P. If that was in today's market that would be worth what $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion. And look a IBM.</p><p>PATEL: Exactly. And things change. I mean you were talking about how big Apple is. We're now talking about just a service section of Apple is as big as Indonesia's GDP, right. And that's a whole different animal.</p><p>And I think that's where I think you're going to have to focus. Apple is -- I don't think they're sitjng here thinking that they're talking about hardware and service. They have to have a platform to keep getting the consumers to come and especially millennials and Gen-Zs who are going to outrank the Baby Boomers as well.</p><p>VAUSE: The next closest company is Amazon in market cap. Microsoft has actually overtaken Google to move into third place which is kind of a total reversal of fortune for Microsoft but again it's because they've got this diversified stream of revenue which is where Apple has gone as well.</p><p>PATEL: It's amazing, right. I mean Microsoft has done a fantastic job. And you think of what Amazon -- what Amazon has done and Microsoft is doing, one word -- Cloud.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>PATEL: They're focusing on the Cloud. That's where -- I mean they've got other things going on but and that's where the higher margins are going to live there and I think that's where it's going to be a race to see who gets there first.</p><p>VAUSE: And not a coal company among them. Big tech company -- go figure. It's the future. Bryan -- thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok, a short break.</p><p>When we come back when it comes to the Russia investigation, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>lawyers says our recollection keeps changing.</p><p>Well, Rudy Giuliani isn't doing much better remembering names as well. We'll explain in a moment.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, as the song goes, sometimes a kiss is just a kiss but sometimes that is not a case when it comes from the Philippine president. A spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte says the president's kiss of a woman on stage was an act of endearment towards Filipino workers. Mr. Duterte had delivered a speech to expatriate Filipinos in Seoul, South Korea. Then he invited two women on stage to give them a book in exchange for kisses. Opponents call the move misogynistic as well as an abuse of power.</p><p>[01:54:54] Sometimes sitting down for an interview on live television could be a little nerve-wracking; some struggle to get their facts straight, others can't seem to get the names right, either.</p><p>Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Before you meet the press, it is best to know who you're meeting and host Chuck Todd is one of those last names that sounds like a first name leaving Rudy Giuliani flummoxed.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, TRUMP ATTORNEY: It's nice to be with you -- Todd. How are you?</p><p>CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS HOST: I'm ok. Let me start --</p><p>GIULIANI: Chris.</p><p>TODD: It's ok.</p><p>MOOS: No Chris on this show either.</p><p>GIULIANI: I'm not playing baseball.</p><p>TODD: Fair enough. But we won't do the last names, Giuliani, right?</p><p>MOOS: Tweeted one viewer, \"So his new name is Todd Chris. Nice ring to it.\"</p><p>Also a nice ring to the name Senator Harry Reid once blurted out for Wolf Blitzer.</p><p>HARRY REID (D), FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: First of all, Blitz, the first -- MOOS: And how about the blitz of Tims President Obama once launched at Matt Lauer--</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE <person><nameText>UNITED STATES</nameText></person>: Well Tim -- I think that --</p><p>Well, I think what it is, Tim --</p><p>Well, Tim, first of all.</p><p>MOOS: Finally Matt couldn't take another Tim.</p><p>MATT LAUER, FORMER MSNBC HOST: I just want to say -- I know you've had a very long week and so have I. You're saying Tim. I know -- it's Matt Lauer, but I -- believe me I completely understand.</p><p>OBAMA: I'm sorry.</p><p>MOOS: But who -- who could call a former president, President Nixon by another president's name to his face no less. Some rookie reporter -- that would be me 34 years ago.</p><p>President Reagan -- sorry, President Nixon.</p><p>RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE <person><nameText>UNITED STATES</nameText></person>: I've been called worse than that.</p><p>MOOS: You know what's worse? When Osama becomes Obama.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obama bin Laden is still at large.</p><p>OBAMA: I think that was Osama bin Laden.</p><p>MOOS: And it was even worse when a sports anchor intentionally used a female tennis star's player's name Chris Evert to goad then quarterback Jim Everett.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chris?</p><p>MOOS: A quarterback sat the host. The subconscious makes some weird links like between Lincoln and Clinton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The 41st president of the <person><nameText>United States, </nameText></person>President Jefferson William Lincoln.</p><p>MOOS: But politicians and anchors tend to answer to anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Blitz --</p><p>OSAMA: Well Tim -- first of all.</p><p>GIULIANI: It's nice to be with you -- Todd.</p><p>MOOS: Jeanne Moos, CNN --</p><p>President Reagan -- sorry, President Nixon. -- New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: It gets a little confusing.

I'm John Vause and this is Newsroom L.A.</p><p> It was barely a month ago when the U.S. President Donald Trump was proclaiming that he and North Korea's Kim Jong-un would try to make their upcoming summit a special moment for world peace.  </p><p> Now, the White House seems to be trying to tamp down expectations. Even the president is saying the June 12th talks are going to be more of a get to know you situation. </p><p> Here's CNN's Jim Sciutto.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment the president first suggested a summit with the North Korean leader, his goal had been ambitious and clear.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT:  If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  This last week as he met in New York with his North Korea counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, reiterated the president's intentions. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The complete verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SCIUTTO:  No longer.  Now the goal of the June 12th meeting in Singapore, just a meet and greet between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, this according to a source familiar with the discussions.</p><p> President Trump said the same publically on Friday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  It's really a get to know you kind of a situation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  The plan, a source tells CNN, is to come to a broad agreement on North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Then negotiations would be handed over to Secretary Pompeo for discussions that could take years. </p><p> This, even as the U.S. still has received no assurances that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I believe they are contemplating a path for where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.  This will obviously be their decision. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  With a downgraded agenda, there is concern growing in Congress that this summit is just for show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ED MARKEY, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT:  We're not going to extract concessions by made-for-TV diplomacy by the photo op that Kim wants, and I think that Trump wants as well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Often before summits like this, there is a managing of expectations.  In this case, really a massive downgrading of expectations, and not the outside world's, but the president's own expectations for this summit described as recently as last week.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SCIUTTO:  Going from a summit where the goal is to have a major agreement, or getting close to a major agreement, to as the president said himself, \"a meet and greet\" to build the relationship.</p><p> Jim Sciutto, CNN Washington.</p><p> VAUSE:  CNN's International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, joins us now live from Seoul in South Korea.</p><p> And, Nic, this is a summit light on details from everything to where the two leaders will actually meet when they get to Singapore, to you know the big stuff, like who will cover the costs of dismantling North Korea's nuclear program, which one study has put at $20 billion. </p><p> NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It seems they're going to have a lot of time to save up that $20 billion, doesn't it John?  Because at the moment, as you said, the tangible detail just doesn't exist.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> It's all aspirational and at the moment, you know President Trump really does see himself, it appears, coming here really just to show Kim that he's willing and this is the man who he'll be doing business with, but let's not worry about the details, let's leave that to other people.</p><p> The timeframe here, even you know from what the state department is saying the (inaudible) of the president's first term of office at least.  So, their creating an expectation here that this won't even be an issue come the next presidential elections.  It really is long-term stuff, without articulating really even what they get to at the end of that, John.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  And, the White House continues to insist, on Monday, that the maximum pressure campaign on North Korea through very tough international sanctions would continue.  Even though the president said last week he wanted to avoid that kind of language, because everyone was getting on now.</p><p> But after the summit, how realistic is it to expect countries like China to stay on board?</p><p> ROBERTSON:  Sure.  Look, President Trump has shown his hand here.  He was very bellicose, very loud, calling Kim Jong-un \"little rocket man\", \"mad man\", things like that last year.   That had everyone worried to the point that they were prepared, because they though President Trump might do something like start a war and it was worth increasing sanctions.</p><p> [01:05] It convinced the Chinese leadership, it convinced many other people and Kim Jong-un among them.  It worked, it got those tougher sanctions, it's gotten Kim to the table. </p><p> But now, President Trump has really shown that he just want to kind of go this alone with Kim Jong-un, a photo op really at the beginning, not clear what comes after that.</p><p> This has given China, Russia and others an opportunity to realize, okay, now we wait for our own best interests.  We recognize that President Trump isn't - - the bluster is kind of empty, really, as far as they can see so far.  So, let's follow our own national security interests and let's begin to sort of see what deals are out there.</p><p> So, for China, what would be the rationale for them to sign up back to tough sanctions?  Now they know it might not be in their interests, because President Trump is looking for a deal in him own interest. Plus, there's a trade war, potentially looming, between the United States and China; the good will's gone, the cards are played.</p><p> So, President Trump may find it very hard to - - to - - to recalibrate and bring back a maximum pressure type situation.</p><p> VAUSE:  It could end up being quite an expensive handshake between these two men at the end of the day, but I guess we'll see.</p><p> Nic, thank you.</p><p> Nic Robertson, live for us there in Seoul.</p><p> For more on this now, we're joined by our political commentator's Democratic strategist, Dave Jacobson, and Republican consultant, John Thomas.</p><p> So, as we get closer to the summit, the White House continues to sort of walk back expectations bigly.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> According to CNN's reporting, \"Trump and his aides have suggested the most concrete product of the June 12th encounter could be a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War\" - - which would not be a bad thing, \"a far cry from the commitment to immediate denuclearization that the administration once insisted would be required for Trump to come to the table\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  So, John, is it possible that maybe the president just overhyped what was possible, what could be achieved at this summit and maybe he didn't understand the complexity of nuclear negotiation? JOHN THOMAS, REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT:  I'm sure he didn't fully understand the complexity, but I wouldn't - - I think just saying that this is a photo op and a hand shake thing, I - - I - - I think that's underplaying what's going to come out of it. </p><p> I think we may see some serious progress here, but the other side of the coin is the president shouldn't say that we have to make a deal or else, because that's giving up a key point of leverage here.</p><p> So, to say that he might just shake hands and walk away, I think is a part of a broader positioning game against North Korea, not just politically positioning for U.S. politics. </p><p> VAUSE:  But, Dave, we talk about leverage and positioning and all that kind of stuff, there seems to be a stunning lack of up-front commitments coming from Pyongyang ahead of this summit.  And, you know the language continues to soften on the U.S. side.</p><p> DAVE JACOBSON, CNN POLITICAL CONSULTANT:  Yes, because if Kim Jong-un is going to get a meeting with the president of the free world, essentially, that elevates him.  That's a massive score for his country, right?</p><p> In a way that we haven't seen in modern times and if Donald Trump fails to deliver anything meaningful beyond a hand shake, or perhaps just some dialog, but nothing tangible in terms of a deal for denuclearization, I think Donald Trump is going to look like a failure, because it is an expectations game.</p><p> Donald Trump is the one who didn't want the meeting, that wanted the meeting, that didn't want the meeting, now we're having the meeting again, like, something's got to get done and if he doesn't, it's going to be a big failure.</p><p> VAUSE:  Although, John, I'm just wondering if that photo op will be enough?  People will see the photograph shaking hands with Kim Jong-un and you know, in a busy world, if you don't have a lot of time for details, they'll just think, \"Hey, he did it\". </p><p> THOMAS:  Perhaps public opinion that day, but it doesn't do anything to make us more safe, and I think South Korea's not going to be pleased with just a hand shake.  So, he has to start to get something done.  I don't know that he has to get something massively, or bigly, done that day, but there has to be something in motion.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> I also think what we're seeing differently with the Trump administration, we're seeing diplomacy play out on Twitter.  I mean, this is something that . . .</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> But, usually the making of the sausage is something we're not privy to, so the back and forth - - when deals are being made, although there's a high stakes deal, deals die a thousand deaths often times before they get made, we just don't see them die all those deaths. This time we're actually living it.</p><p> VAUSE:  Is that a good thing, Dave? </p><p> JACOBSON:  I don't think so.  I mean look at the juxtaposition, right? You've got Donald Trump engaging with the North Koreans over Twitter, and then alienating our allies in Canada and Mexico, or the E.U. with the supposed trade war.  I mean, it's unprecedented in conversation.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VAUSE:  Okay.  Well, the new normal, Trump's former campaign chairman could be heading to jail.  Prosecutors are trying to revoke his house arrest, accusing him of witness tampering.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> Saying Paul Manafort repeatedly contacted two people who worked and previously assisted in his lobbying and public relations efforts for Ukrainian politicians.  Manafort sought to secure materially false testimony concerning activities of an influential group of European leaders called the Hapsburg group, that Manafort once used to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> VAUSE:  As for the president, even before this news broke, he was throwing Manafort under the bus tweeting this, \"Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a very short period of time, he represented Ronald Regan, Bob Dole and many others over the years, but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  John, so somehow this is the fault of the former FBI Director, James Comey?  Does this president take responsibility for anything?</p><p> THOMAS:  It's a difficult thing.  I mean . . .</p><p> JACOBSON:  Translation - - no.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> THOMAS:  No, no, no it's a difficult road, because I think the president, if he had been told by the FBI, I don't think he would have hired Manafort.  </p><p> He hired Manafort because he thought he wasn't going to win the convention, he needed somebody who knew how to whip votes, and Roger Stone told him hey, Manafort's done this before and he brought him right in.  But, just to say it's the FBI's fault, I mean that doesn't make sense.  </p><p> Btu, remember all of these things that Paul is getting nailed for - - it's not about his role in the campaign and Russian collusion, yet. But, I'm just saying all of these news tightening tactics are bad actions that Paul's taken in his private business life, not campaign maneuvers.</p><p> VAUSE:  And what this all means for the possibility of Manafort getting a pardon remains unclear, but the president has no doubts about himself.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> Tweeting this, \"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to pardon\" - - in all caps, \"myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats\" - - they're actually Republicans, \"and others continues into the mid- terms\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  And, Dave, the president also described the appointment of the special counsel as unconstitutional, which seems to suggest he doesn't really understand what's in the Constitution. </p><p> JACOBSON:  Right, and like the special counsel, is a Republican.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> But, look, if Donald Trump was innocent, if Donald Trump did nothing wrong, or his campaign did nothing wrong, then why would he say that the president can't obstruct justice?  Why would he say that he can pardon himself?  Why would his lawyers say that they're not going to have him testify before Bob Mueller?  </p><p> Clearly, there's something there.  They're clearly hiding something. The question is what?  And whether or not Bob Mueller's going to find that evidence and use it against the president?  Right?  But, why is going there, if he hasn't anything to hide?</p><p> VAUSE:  It does look a little odd.  John?</p><p> THOMAS:  Well, I think the president and his attorneys are just trying to protect him from a perjury trap.  I think the president knows that there was no Russian collusion, he said it a thousand times.  There has yet to be any evidence produced to date, other than processed crimes related to some of these Papadopoulos' and others, showing Russian collusion.</p><p> But, when you get - - it's like Chuck Schumer said if the FBI wants to get you, they have six different ways to Sunday to get you.</p><p> VAUSE:  Well, this first claim was made by Trump's lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that basically Trump could pardon himself and that brought out two very different responses from two Republican Senators.  First, here's Chuck Grassley.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHUCK GRASSLEY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR:  If I were the President of the United States and I had a lawyer that told me I could pardon myself, I think I'd hire a new lawyer.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUSE:  And, now what was truly a priceless moment from Ted Cruz.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REPORTER:  Senator, the president says he can pardon himself.  Would you agree with that?</p><p> (PAUSE) TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN SENATOR:  That is not a Constitutional issue I've studied, so I will withhold judgment at this point. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUSE:  John, it took him 18 seconds to come up with that dodge and that's the best he could come up with?  Seriously, he has no opinion on this?  He's a lawyer.  I mean, this is his thing.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> THOMAS:  I think we need to look back at when Giuliani made those statements on what 'Meet the Press'?  He looks off to the side and laughs like well I suppose he could pardon himself, but he never would because the public opinion would immediately impeach him.  So, we're running off on this idea of whether or not he has the power . . .</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> But even Giuliani was like, if the guy ever thought about doing that, he'd be immediately impeached. </p><p> VAUSE:  Dave, what is incredibly you know astounding about Cruz, and his willingness to carry water for this president, is that during the campaign Trump essentially called his wife ugly and said his father played a role in the assassination of JFK.  I mean, the list goes on and yet Ted Cruz continues to sort of lay down for Donald Trump.</p><p> JACOBSON:  I think it's largely a function that Senator Cruz is up for reelection and he is trying to you know avoid alienating the Trump slice of the electorate, and prevent them from staying home in the upcoming general elections.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> But, he wants to be a Senator.  He wants to have - - he probably has future presidential ambitions and so he needs to be reelected in order to like put himself on that trajectory, right?  And so, I think the challenge is will those Trump voters stay home, if he goes after the president.</p><p> [01:15] But look, it's not just Ted Cruz, you've got like Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, today, came out and said they would have catastrophic implications.  Chris Christie, the former Republican Governor, who also campaigned against Donald Trump, said that it was outrageous to even think about whether or not President Trump can pardon himself.</p><p> So, there are some Republicans splitting from him, but I agree at the end of the day, like we need those Ted Cruz's of the world to stand up to the president. </p><p> VAUSE:  Giuliani did actually try to walk back that original statement a few hours ago, while appearing on CNN with Chris Cuomo.  This is what he said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIULIANI:  I said very theoretically the answer is the president can't be prosecuted for anything.  There's a Constitutional remedy for that, and of course that would be entirely ridiculous.  </p><p> CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST:  Right, but you could have made the point . . .</p><p> GIULIANI:  It was a hypothetical that you would entertain in a law school and that's what I tried to say.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUSE:  The only problem is it's not a hypothetical situation because the president is facing legal jeopardy here, and it's a very real possibility that he is actually possibly thinking about pardoning himself.  And, what many have said, and it's not a slam dunk that he can do it, because there is an opinion out there that the president is not above the law.</p><p> THOMAS:  Yes.</p><p> VAUSE:  Is the president above the law?  In this country, can he do whatever he wants?</p><p> THOMAS:  No, he can't, but at the same time in the course of doing his job, he can essentially do what he wants.  If he wants to fire people, he can fire people and his justification that he wants to fire them is pretty much all it takes.  But, he is held accountable, or can be held accountable, by the Congress.</p><p> Giuliani's problem is he is straddling this weird world where he's a spokesperson, but he's an attorney and he wants to answer as an attorney sometimes, but a disciplined messenger at others.  And, it's just weird moment - - he keeps stepping in it . . .</p><p> VAUSE:  He keeps stepping on rakes.</p><p> THOMAS:  Right.  They're self-inflicted.</p><p> VAUSE:  Totally.  </p><p> Okay.  Let's finish up here with the president starting a very public feud with the Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles.  He cancelled their trip to the White House, this is traditional for the winners to go there.  It was cancelled because a few players decided not to go and they let that be known long before the invitations went out, but here is the latest Trump Tweet.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> \"The Philadelphia Eagles football team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event.  Staying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry.\"</p><p> VAUSE:  Here's a statement in response to the you know the invitation being rescinded from the mayor of Philadelphia, \"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> Dave, this is a fight the president clearly wants to have because it appeals to his base, but why does he get to decide the definition of patriotism? </p><p> JACOBSON:  He doesn't.  I mean, this is by the way, another example of Donald Trump like changing the conversation away.  Like, he should be talking about his 500 days and if I'm a Republican, my tax cuts and all these great things that I've done as Donald Trump.</p><p> He's trying to change the conversation away from that, which I just don't get.  What I found fascinating, though, was the mayor of Philadelphia, his chief of staff put out this Tweet today basically showing this juxtaposition of you know, Donald Trump's inauguration photo, versus, after the Eagles won the Super Bowl - - we've got more fans than you do, which I thought was fun.</p><p> VAUSE:  So, John, clearly you know this is a fight the president could have avoided.  But, he jumped in boots and all.  He loves this stuff and he sees it in his interest, but maybe not in the country's interest?</p><p> THOMAS:  Well, politically he won the last fight.  He's going to win this again.  He understands this is an opportunity to do an \"us versus them\" saying the American flag is bigger than the NFL, and it is, and it has been and it is a wedge.</p><p> And so, look, I think it's actually smart politics of the president and he's being consistent on this message, and anytime he has an opportunity to double down on it, he will and he'll win again.</p><p> VAUSE:  Smart politics, Dave, but is it good for the country?</p><p> JACOBSON:  No, it's further dividing the country.  I mean, this president, ever since the inception of his campaign has divided the country.   So, he's doing the complete opposite of that and I think that's the challenge is you've got these NFL players that are saying, you know, we've got a racist and a bigot in the White House, and I'm not going to step foot in it as long as Donald Trump's the president.</p><p> VAUSE:  Which is their right?</p><p> JACOBSON:  Yes, they're expressing their First Amendment right, absolutely.  But, I think the challenge is the president's supposed to be the bigger person, right?  The president is supposed to invite these national champions to come in, whether they agree with him politically or not, and be the bigger person and Donald Trump isn't capable of doing that.</p><p> VAUSE:  It's also the people's house, it's not a Trump property, just FYI.</p><p> THOMAS:  But, it's not about bowing down to Trump, it's about standing for the American flag.  It's a whole different thing.</p><p> VAUSE:  You have the last word.</p><p> [01:20] THOMAS:  But this, as you say, Trump's been dividing, he's actually been standing up to unite us saying we can disagree politically, but in this moment for the National Anthem, we should be proud to be an American, put that first.</p><p> JACOBSON:  I don't remember Donald Trump ever saying that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VAUSE:  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks, John.</p><p> Okay.  Well, still to come, many in Guatemala say their relatives have been buried alive when a volcano erupted suddenly.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> Engulfing villages in lava and thick clouds of ash, and throwing rocks.  More on that in a moment.</p><p> Also ahead, Apple shows off its newest bells and whistles as the company value inches closer to a major trillion dollar milestone.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> VAUSE:  The Kilauea volcano is not letting up on Hawaii, the lava has now destroyed at least 117 homes in the past month alone.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> And, it's covering more than 2,000 acres of land.  There were about 500 tremors in the summit area over the weekend and a river of lava has entered the ocean at another base, sending a dangerous mix of acid and volcanic glass particles into the air. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  When Guatemala's Fuego volcano roared back to life without notice on Sunday, it spewed rivers of lava.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> And, these huge clouds of debris, burning rocks and volcanic ash, and hot gas.  The deluge buried entire families, killing at least 69 people, but that death toll is believed that it will rise.</p><p> CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more now.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Guatemala's volcano of fire is living up to its name, after a deadly explosion that killed dozens of people, many more are wounded or are missing.  It all began on Sunday when really out of nowhere, this active volcano that has not exploded for months - - has not caused any fatalities in quite some time, suddenly came alive.</p><p> Rivers of lava came pouring down the volcano, people did not have time to flee the lava or the flying rocks that many of the village were on fire and damaged homes, whole towns were wiped out.  Even now, rescuers are having a hard time reaching many of these small towns/</p><p> People said that the people who came down the mountains were covered in ash, many of them were dazed, so they barely escaped with their lives and were worried about where their relatives are.</p><p>Guatemala's main airport was closed for several hours, has reopened, although some flights are cancelled.  Ash has been seen as far away as Guatemala City and in El Salvador.  Really, much of this region is still responding to this deadly, deadly tragedy, many more are feared dead.</p><p> [01:25] Guatemala is now in a state of mourning - - three days of mourning, and officials are concerned that more eruptions could be on the way.</p><p> Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:   Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera joins us now with more on the ongoing threats from the volcano and how the weather could play a role in all of this.</p><p> Ivan.</p><p> IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, we'll be talking about some rain over the next couple of days and that's I think going to add additional problems here to what is already a calamity, the likes of which they haven't seen in this area, and from this particular volcano, in 40 years.  Yes, it had an eruption earlier this year, but obviously nothing like what we had on this Sunday.  </p><p> So, here's what's happening.  We have a seasonal rainy pattern, right? Typical for this time of year in Guatemala to get very heavy rain, tropical downpours, especially through the afternoon hours.  That is problematic because when rain mixes with ash, that's when we start getting in lahars - - and I'll talk about that in a second. </p><p> But, another thing that officials have been warning about as well, because of all the ash that is in the area, contamination of water supplies could be an issue over the next several days. </p><p> This is Mt. Saint Helen's, not our volcano there in Guatemala, but I'm showing you this picture because I think it really gives you a good idea of what we're talking about here, and that's just a word for mudflow, a violent one, in fact, it only occurs when you mix in water.</p><p> So, talk about tropical downpours mixing in with that volcanic ash, you could set up a violent mudflow that can essentially go through riverbeds, can be as deep as meters and also moving rather fast at around 20 to 40 kilometers per hour.</p><p> We've seen some of those mudflows, some of those lahars destroy entire communities here.  So, we're going to have to watch this very closely over the next few days.  Why?</p><p> Because of this.  We have heavy rain that's going to be on the way, not just tomorrow or the next day, John, but this is going to be an ongoing threat, I think, really right through the upcoming days, each and every day, very heavy rain on the way for the area.</p><p> VAUSE:  Okay.  That brings the problem with mudslides and a whole bunch of other stuff.</p><p> Ivan, thank you.</p><p> Well, for the first time Saudi Arabia has issued drivers licenses to women.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> Three weeks before a ban on female drivers is expected to end.  Call it baby steps, perhaps - - 10, that's 10 women were given a license on Monday, but another 2,000 will receive theirs next week.</p><p> It's all part of a plan by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to reshape the economy, which includes more women in the workforce.  But, the U.N. is condemning the recent arrests of at least 11 women and rights activists, some of whom remain behind bars accused of undermining the Kingdom's security.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUSE:  Still to come here.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in the case of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> But, the broader debate about religious freedom is far from over.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [01:30:18] VAUSE,:  Welcome back everybody.</p><p> You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p> A source tells CNN the Kim (ph) and Trump (ph) summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will be more of a meet and greet and that the goal is a broad agreement on nuclear disarmament the details of which could still take years to negotiate.</p><p> At least 69 people were killed after Guatemala's Fuego Volcano erupted Sunday with sudden speed and ferocity.  It spewed rivers of lava and these huge clouds of burning rocks and volcanic ash as well as hot gas.  The death toll is expected to rise as a number of families are missing.</p><p> Anti-austerity protests in Jordan have led to the resignation of Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki.  But demonstrators plan to keep up the pressure until a proposed income tax reform is scrapped.  The International Monetary Fund supported the law (ph) aimed at cutting Jordan's massive public debt.  King Abdullah has tapped a former World Bank economist to form a new government.</p><p> The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple.  Jack Phillips said it was against his religious beliefs.  And the couple accused him of violating anti- discrimination laws.</p><p> But in a very specific ruling the Court said the state of Colorado showed hostility towards Phillips based on his beliefs.  The Court did not settle the larger constitutional question of religious liberty versus discrimination.</p><p> Well criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool joins me now for more on this.  It's good to see you -- Brian.  Thanks for coming in.</p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Hey -- John.  Yes, thanks.</p><p> VAUSE:  It was interesting.  This case was litigated over grounds of freedom of speech but at the end of the day the opinion written by Justice Kennedy seemed to sort of address the problem of bias -- remember the case was initially heard by Colorado's Civil Rights Commission.</p><p> Kennedy wrote that one commissioner had crossed the line when he said freedom of religion has been used just like all kinds of discrimination throughout history whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust.  This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and mutual enforcement of Colorado's anti-discrimination laws.</p><p> But overall it seems, the Court made it fairly clear that the states are allowed to force businesses, whatever that business is, whether it's a cake shop or anything else, that they have to serve all customers -- gays, lesbians, everyone -- which I guess in the big picture here the cake shop owner he may have won the battle but he loses the war.</p><p> CLAYPPOOL:  Yes John -- in my opinion the U.S. Supreme Court punted. This was a great opportunity for the Court to rule on the clash between faith and first amendment rights and discrimination.</p><p> And instead of reaching an opinion that addressed that issue they used, in my opinion, a collateral issue to rule on this.  By collateral, what I mean is well, one of the Civil Rights Commission members made a comment about religion -- </p><p> VAUSE:  And religious beliefs -- </p><p> CLAYPOOL:  -- yes, religious beliefs being used as a propeller for discrimination.  But that wasn't really the issue here.  The issue to me was whether these, the bakers -- Jack Phillips, the baker -- whether he was losing his right, his belief in religion, and his first amendment right at the expense of discrimination?  </p><p> VAUSE:  Why do you think they punted?  </p><p> CLAYPOOL:  They didn't want to rule on this issue.</p><p> VAUSE:  Why?  </p><p> CLAYPOOL:  It is a tough issue.  Let's break it down for example.  The first issue that I talk about is whether baking a cake is even protected by the First Amendment.  We haven't even talked about that. You know, I would argue as a civil rights lawyer, too, that it is not.</p><p> The reason why is these bakers have a right to go out and protest. They could still argue against gay rights.  And in fact, these bakers, they declined the gay couple before they even talked about the creative aspect of the cake.  So in my opinion the cake is not even first amendment.</p><p> But even if it is, you then have to look at an issue of whether that somehow squares with the law.  You mentioned it.  There is a law, John -- there is a law in Colorado.  It makes it categorically clear that you cannot discriminate against someone based on sexual orientation. And clearly that's what I think happened here.</p><p> VAUSE:  David Cole -- excuse me -- he represented the gay couple.  He wrote an op-ed in the \"Washington Post\", and that's his opinion, that Colorado's Commission's ruling -- initial ruling was well within the law.  He wrote \"The commission's statement that one cannot invoke religion to harm others is actually black-letter constitutional law as is the notion that one cannot invoke religion to avoid complying with the general rule requiring businesses not to discriminate based on the Supreme Court itself did just that in the 1990 Employment Division versus Smith case.\"</p><p> So even if the commission was biased in some way or one commissioner held these beliefs and was sort of biased -- what does that matter if the decision is still within the law?  </p><p> [01:35:00] CLAYPOOL:  You're absolutely right.  The Supreme Court using the bias of the commission is a complete cop-out.</p><p> The fact of the matter is this.  In 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.  So are you telling me that gays can legally marry but yet they can walk into a bakery now and they can be discriminated against?</p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  Those two principles are at odds.  And that's why I think this Supreme Court did not want to address this issue square on.  </p><p> VAUSE:  Ok.  Well, there was this bigger question about discrimination versus religious freedom.  And the Court -- part of the opinion is this.  \"It is a general rule that religious and philosophical objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a mutual and generally- applicable public accommodations law.\"</p><p> Ok.  So having that there -- having said that now, if Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the couple who wanted the cake, if they turned up back at the master -- what is it -- Masterpiece Cake Shop, placed the same order.  Is it true to say that the owner Jack Phillips he would not have a first amendment right to turn them away at this point?  Or is that still yet to be settled?</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  No.  It hasn't been settled.</p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  Here's what I would do.  This is what I would recommend.  I recommend that a gay -- any gay couple walk into the same bakery tomorrow and they order a wedding cake, and have Jack Phillips deny the cake and then let's have a commission in Colorado not make these comments -- </p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  -- about discrimination, religion being used as discrimination.  Have them be on the up and up, issue their ruling and then that forces the U.S. Supreme Court then to really come to head with this issue.  </p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.  And in fact, the governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper said that, you know, that's what they'll be looking at with this commission.  There was some soaring language in this opinion piece by Kennedy when it comes to the recognition of gay rights.</p><p> How society comes to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.  For that reason the laws and the constitution can and in some instances must protect them and the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.\"</p><p> You know, so you've got this opinion here which seems to be at odds with the ultimate decision siding with the owner of the cake shop.  At the end of the day, given what he has written here, if there is another case that goes forward how much weigh does that sort of stuff carry.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  Well, it's not going to carry as much weight.</p><p> VAUSE:  Right.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  Here is what's going to happen.  This is going to come up again -- </p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  -- in the very near future.  And we're not going to have any excuse for the Supreme Court to avoid making a decision that's based on the real issues.</p><p> We don't have a ruling today -- John, based on the real issues because the first amendment does not give you a right to violate the law.  And that's exactly what happened here.  You can't come up with some religious idea that all of a sudden, it is against my religion -- </p><p> VAUSE:  To serve black people -- </p><p> CLAYPOOL:  -- what about white people?  And of a sudden, all white people go into a bakery can't get a cake?  That just is squarely at odds with the fundamentals in our society -- of civil rights, constitutional rights.  </p><p> VAUSE:  And as you say, it was a great chance to resolve this issue. And forever whatever that is -- I guess it will be settled one way or the other.  </p><p> CLAYPOOL:  We're going to see this again where the cake is going to clash with faith.  That's going to happen again.  We're going to see it soon.</p><p> VAUSE:  You can't have your faith cake and eat your cake -- you know, I guess we'll find out.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  I think so.</p><p> VAUSE:  Thanks -- Brian.</p><p> CLAYPOOL:  All right.  Thanks for having me -- John.</p><p> VAUSE:  Pleasure.</p><p> Next here on NEWSROOM L.A., Apple's CEO talks cell phone addiction and what a trade war with China could mean for the cost of an iPhone. [01:38:39] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> VAUSE:  Welcome back everybody.</p><p> Apple is on the verge of becoming the first trillion-dollar company as executives showed off the newest software upgrades on Monday Apple stock rose again pushing it closer to that milestone.  CEO Tim Cook sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall about Apple's future.</p><p> LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there.</p><p> Well, a lot of excitement today.  You have over 5,000 developers here for the developer conference.  This is where we hear a lot about the latest features we'll see on our phone in the next coming months.</p><p> One feature in particular that was really interesting and almost unexpected was a tech addiction tool.  It's aimed at helping us use our phones less and taking control back.  It's called Screen Time.</p><p> I had the opportunity to sit down with Tim cook who cares a lot about tech and humanity and spoke to me specifically about this.  Take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEGALL:  You guys announced a tech addiction tool that will almost help us limit our screen time.  So what is the thinking behind that?  </p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Well you know, we've never been focused on usage as a key parameter.  We want people to be incredibly satisfied and empowered by our devices that we ship (ph).  But we've never wanted people to spend a lot of time on them or all of their time on them.</p><p> And you know, it is a personal thing as to how much is too much.  We thought a lot about this and we're rolling out great tools to both make people aware of how much time they're spending and the apps that they're spending them in but also how many times they pick up their point.  How many notifications they get?   Who is sending them the notifications?  </p><p> SEGALL:  So tell me about your own tech habits.</p><p> COOK:  Yes.  I've been using it and I have to tell you I thought I was fairly disciplined about this.  And I was wrong.  When I began to get the data, I found I was spending a lot more time than I should.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Like where?  </p><p> COOK:  Well, I don't want to give you all the apps but just too much. And the number of times I picked up the phone were too many.  </p><p> SEGALL:  What do you tell people who are worried they're addicted to their smart phones who are worried about tech's impact on children?   COOK:  I think ultimately, each person has to make the decision when they get their numbers as to what they would like to do.  And I encourage everyone to look and everyone to make an informed decision and ask themselves if they're picking up their phone 10 times an hour or 20 times an hour maybe they could do it less.</p><p> I think the power is now shifted to the user.  And that's just been what Apple has always been about is giving the power from the institution to the user.  </p><p> SEGALL:  It's so interesting because there is this idea, who is control?  Man or machine.  You believe that we as human beings, we can control -- </p><p> COOK:  I absolutely do.  I don't subscribe to the machines taking over the world.  And I don't worry about that.  I worry much more about people thinking like machines than machines thinking like people.  </p><p> SEGALL:  What do you mean?  That's interesting.  What do you mean?</p><p> COOK:  I mean forgetting the humanity in things, forgetting that all of our products should be infused with humanity.  </p><p> SEGALL:  I get the sense that that feels very personal to you -- what you just said.  </p><p> COOK:  It does.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Why?  </p><p> COOK:  Because it's the reason I'm on the face of the earth.  It makes it really personal, right that this is the role I play.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?  </p><p> COOK:  Generally, for me I'm not a big fan of regulation.  I think self-regulation is the best.  But when it's not working and in some cases it's not work, you have to ask yourself so what form of regulation might be good?  </p><p> [01:45:01] SEGALL:  What kind do you think isn't working?</p><p> COOK:  Well, I think that the privacy thing has gotten totally out of control.  And I think most people are not aware of who is tracking them, how much they're being tracked, and sort of the large amounts of detailed data that are out there about them.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy? Is it a luxury at this point?  </p><p> COOK:  No.  To me -- and we feel this very deeply -- we think privacy a fundamental human right.  So that is the angle that we look at it. Privacy from an American point of view is one of these key civil liberties that's define what it is to be American.  </p><p> SEGALL:  It's a fundamental human right.  Do you think the last year has shown that that fundamental human right could be under attack?  </p><p> COOK:  I think it has been under attack.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple.  As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?</p><p> COOK:  Well, I haven't read the opinion and so I reserve the right to read that and deeply understand.  It was very prominent (ph).</p><p> But in terms of the general topic, we believe that everybody should treat everybody else with dignity and respect.  And that's how we run our company.  That's what we expect of each other and that pertains to all communities including the LGBTQ community.  </p><p> SEGALL:  I know that there is this fear (ph) -- the impact on consumers and will iPhone prices go up if there's an escalated trade war?  I'd be curious to know -- I know you said you're optimistic before.  Are you still optimistic?  </p><p> COOK:  I am.  I am very optimistic because no one will win from that. It will be a lose-lose.</p><p> SEGALL:  Do you think that if that were to occur, that iPhone prices could go up? </p><p> COOK:  I don't think that iPhone will get a tariff on it is my belief. Based on what I've been told and what I see, I just don't see that.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEGALL:  And here at this conference, you have developers from over 70 different countries.  So immigration is in the DNA of Apple.  It is why you'll hear Tim speak very openly about immigration practices. And you know, at a very fascinating moment in time and technology where we're talking about tech addiction, we're talking about privacy and politics because at this moment, technology is the underlayer to society.</p><p> And you very much see the CEO looking to step into a role to just go beyond, you know, just tech's impact on this whole feature (ph) but also on society.  He said, you know, he feels a much larger obligation.  He says it's why he's here on this earth.</p><p> Back to you.  </p><p> VAUSE:  Laurie Segall -- thank you for that.</p><p> Global business executive Bryan Patel joins me for more now on Apple and the rise and rise of the Apple stock.</p><p> Well, it's interesting Apple opened its annual conference for developers on Monday and the stock price actually went up. (INAUDIBLE) a historical trend it was only going down over the last 14, 15 years.  The stock closed at $191.83 was up almost 1 percent. But to reach this magic tree in dollar mark, it is kind of a little iffy, you know.  But basically the stock price reached somewhere around $202.30.  So given, you know, what we know of Apple, its performance, you know, the last couple years -- what is that a matter of weeks, a matter of months.  I mean how long before we get there? $60 billion come on -- how hard is that.</p><p> BRYAN PATEL, GLOBAL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE:  Listen -- I think that's underestimated.  Everyone thinks like, you know we're joking about it. But I think -- they're going to get to the $60 billion mark.</p><p> It wasn't until a few years ago where analysts were going after them saying where's your new product?  Where's your new product.  This is going to go down. </p><p> What has changed is their service?  People are focusing on things at their higher margin items and they've kind of diversified to some other different things.  So I believe -- I think they're going to get there probably faster than the competitors or anyone else nearby.  And I think they've been really smart of how they've been growing their platform.  </p><p> VAUSE:  The most important issue I guess isn't really when Apple reaches this milestone.  It's just a number.  At the end of the day it doesn't mean a whole lot.  What is far more important is essentially, you know, how is the company run as you say?  Can it continue to grow? Can it continue to produce revenue?</p><p> PATEL:  Well, here's the thing.  We kind of joke about how the Apple Watches didn't really go off with a hitch.  But you think about, you know, the air pods, right?  High margins, high in demand -- </p><p> VAUSE:  They forced everyone to get them because they got rid of the jack.  It wasn't really innovation.</p><p> PATEL:  Wall Street loves what -- service models.  They love money and they love companies -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PATEL:  Apple has transformed themselves, not just to be a hardware company.</p><p> VAUSE:  Right.</p><p> PATEL:  And they moved toward this so that means their valuation and the potential higher up is going to go.</p><p> Now, they didn't invent the wireless head phone but they are finding ways for you to have it stay in with the Apple family.  It's no different from some other companies like Amazon and right that's what they've done too.</p><p> VAUSE:  It's very clever stuff which basically if Apple gets to this trillion-dollar mark, if it was a country it would have the 17th biggest economy in the world, which is kind of terrifying to think that you know, this company has that much power. [01:49:58] How much though is that to do with the nature of the stock market today?  With, you know, surging prices -- and you know, is it simply that, you know, trillion-dollar companies are just not that special?  It's something to be expected in this, you know, current set up.</p><p> PATEL:  You know, I hate to say yes because I think they've worked -- I think out of all the companies, Apple has gotten a lot of scrutiny over the last few years to get to where they got to and to get to that number is a special number.  But yes.</p><p> I think you're expecting, you are always expecting what are they doing next?  How they streamline things?  There's always going to be behind them, right.  And I think know we're focusing, ok, $1 trillion -- we're not even there yet, we're already going -- </p><p> VAUSE:  Big deal.</p><p> PATEL:  Big deal, who's next.</p><p> VAUSE:  Well, I guess because back in the 1980s IBM, you know, this huge company that now is pretty much nothing.  It has already been broken up and sold off.  It had 60 percent of the S&amp;P.  If that was in today's market that would be worth what $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion. And look a IBM.  </p><p> PATEL:  Exactly.  And things change.  I mean you were talking about how big Apple is.  We're now talking about just a service section of Apple is as big as Indonesia's GDP, right.  And that's a whole different animal. </p><p> And I think that's where I think you're going to have to focus.  Apple is -- I don't think they're sitjng here thinking that they're talking about hardware and service.  They have to have a platform to keep getting the consumers to come and especially millennials and Gen-Zs who are going to outrank the Baby Boomers as well.  </p><p> VAUSE:  The next closest company is Amazon in market cap.  Microsoft has actually overtaken Google to move into third place which is kind of a total reversal of fortune for Microsoft but again it's because they've got this diversified stream of revenue which is where Apple has gone as well.  </p><p> PATEL:  It's amazing, right.  I mean Microsoft has done a fantastic job.  And you think of what Amazon -- what Amazon has done and Microsoft is doing, one word -- Cloud.</p><p> VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p> PATEL:  They're focusing on the Cloud.  That's where -- I mean they've got other things going on but and that's where the higher margins are going to live there and I think that's where it's going to be a race to see who gets there first.  </p><p> VAUSE:  And not a coal company among them.  Big tech company -- go figure.  It's the future. Bryan -- thank you.  Good to see you.</p><p> VAUSE:  Ok, a short break.</p><p> When we come back when it comes to the Russia investigation, Donald Trump's lawyers says our recollection keeps changing.</p><p> Well, Rudy Giuliani isn't doing much better remembering names as well. We'll explain in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> VAUSE:  Well, as the song goes, sometimes a kiss is just a kiss but sometimes that is not a case when it comes from the Philippine president.  A spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte says the president's kiss of a woman on stage was an act of endearment towards Filipino workers. Mr. Duterte had delivered a speech to expatriate Filipinos in Seoul, South Korea.  Then he invited two women on stage to give them a book in exchange for kisses.  Opponents call the move misogynistic as well as an abuse of power.</p><p> [01:54:54] Sometimes sitting down for an interview on live television could be a little nerve-wracking; some struggle to get their facts straight, others can't seem to get the names right, either.</p><p> Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Before you meet the press, it is best to know who you're meeting and host Chuck Todd is one of those last names that sounds like a first name leaving Rudy Giuliani flummoxed.  </p><p> RUDY GIULIANI, TRUMP ATTORNEY:  It's nice to be with you -- Todd.  How are you?</p><p> CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS HOST:  I'm ok.  Let me start -- </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris.</p><p> TODD:  It's ok.</p><p> MOOS:  No Chris on this show either.</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm not playing baseball.</p><p> TODD:  Fair enough.  But we won't do the last names, Giuliani, right?  </p><p> MOOS:  Tweeted one viewer, \"So his new name is Todd Chris.  Nice ring to it.\"</p><p> Also a nice ring to the name Senator Harry Reid once blurted out for Wolf Blitzer.  </p><p> HARRY REID (D), FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  First of all, Blitz, the first --  MOOS:  And how about the blitz of Tims President Obama once launched at Matt Lauer-- </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well Tim -- I think that -- </p><p> Well, I think what it is, Tim -- </p><p> Well, Tim, first of all.  </p><p> MOOS:  Finally Matt couldn't take another Tim.  </p><p> MATT LAUER, FORMER MSNBC HOST:  I just want to say -- I know you've had a very long week and so have I.  You're saying Tim.

I'm John Vause and this is Newsroom L.A.</p><p>It was barely a month ago when the U.S. President Donald Trump was proclaiming that he and North Korea's Kim Jong-un would try to make their upcoming summit a special moment for world peace.  </p><p>Now, the White House seems to be trying to tamp down expectations. Even the president is saying the June 12th talks are going to be more of a get to know you situation. </p><p>Here's CNN's Jim Sciutto.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment the president first suggested a summit with the North Korean leader, his goal had been ambitious and clear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT:  If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO:  This last week as he met in New York with his North Korea counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, reiterated the president's intentions. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The complete verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SCIUTTO:  No longer.  Now the goal of the June 12th meeting in Singapore, just a meet and greet between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, this according to a source familiar with the discussions.</p><p>President Trump said the same publically on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It's really a get to know you kind of a situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO:  The plan, a source tells CNN, is to come to a broad agreement on North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Then negotiations would be handed over to Secretary Pompeo for discussions that could take years. </p><p>This, even as the U.S. still has received no assurances that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I believe they are contemplating a path for where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.  This will obviously be their decision. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO:  With a downgraded agenda, there is concern growing in Congress that this summit is just for show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ED MARKEY, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT:  We're not going to extract concessions by made-for-TV diplomacy by the photo op that Kim wants, and I think that Trump wants as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO:  Often before summits like this, there is a managing of expectations.  In this case, really a massive downgrading of expectations, and not the outside world's, but the president's own expectations for this summit described as recently as last week.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SCIUTTO:  Going from a summit where the goal is to have a major agreement, or getting close to a major agreement, to as the president said himself, \"a meet and greet\" to build the relationship.</p><p>Jim Sciutto, CNNWashington.</p><p>VAUSE:  CNN's International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, joins us now live from Seoul in South Korea.</p><p>And, Nic, this is a summit light on details from everything to where the two leaders will actually meet when they get to Singapore, to you know the big stuff, like who will cover the costs of dismantling North Korea's nuclear program, which one study has put at $20 billion. </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It seems they're going to have a lot of time to save up that $20 billion, doesn't it John?  Because at the moment, as you said, the tangible detail just doesn't exist.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>It's all aspirational and at the moment, you know President Trump really does see himself, it appears, coming here really just to show Kim that he's willing and this is the man who he'll be doing business with, but let's not worry about the details, let's leave that to other people.</p><p>The timeframe here, even you know from what the state department is saying the (inaudible) of the president's first term of office at least.  So, their creating an expectation here that this won't even be an issue come the next presidential elections.  It really is long-term stuff, without articulating really even what they get to at the end of that, John.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  And, the White House continues to insist, on Monday, that the maximum pressure campaign on North Korea through very tough international sanctions would continue.  Even though the president said last week he wanted to avoid that kind of language, because everyone was getting on now.</p><p>But after the summit, how realistic is it to expect countries like China to stay on board?</p><p>ROBERTSON:  Sure.  Look, President Trump has shown his hand here.  He was very bellicose, very loud, calling Kim Jong-un \"little rocket man\", \"mad man\", things like that last year.   That had everyone worried to the point that they were prepared, because they though President Trump might do something like start a war and it was worth increasing sanctions.</p><p>[01:05] It convinced the Chinese leadership, it convinced many other people and Kim Jong-un among them.  It worked, it got those tougher sanctions, it's gotten Kim to the table. </p><p>But now, President Trump has really shown that he just want to kind of go this alone with Kim Jong-un, a photo op really at the beginning, not clear what comes after that.</p><p>This has given China, Russia and others an opportunity to realize, okay, now we wait for our own best interests.  We recognize that President Trump isn't - - the bluster is kind of empty, really, as far as they can see so far.  So, let's follow our own national security interests and let's begin to sort of see what deals are out there.</p><p>So, for China, what would be the rationale for them to sign up back to tough sanctions?  Now they know it might not be in their interests, because President Trump is looking for a deal in him own interest. Plus, there's a trade war, potentially looming, between the United States and China; the good will's gone, the cards are played.</p><p>So, President Trump may find it very hard to - - to - - to recalibrate and bring back a maximum pressure type situation.</p><p>VAUSE:  It could end up being quite an expensive handshake between these two men at the end of the day, but I guess we'll see.</p><p>Nic, thank you.</p><p>Nic Robertson, live for us there in Seoul.</p><p>For more on this now, we're joined by our political commentator's Democratic strategist, Dave Jacobson, and Republican consultant, John Thomas.</p><p>So, as we get closer to the summit, the White House continues to sort of walk back expectations bigly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>According to CNN's reporting, \"Trump and his aides have suggested the most concrete product of the June 12th encounter could be a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War\" - - which would not be a bad thing, \"a far cry from the commitment to immediate denuclearization that the administration once insisted would be required for Trump to come to the table\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  So, John, is it possible that maybe the president just overhyped what was possible, what could be achieved at this summit and maybe he didn't understand the complexity of nuclear negotiation? JOHN THOMAS, REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT:  I'm sure he didn't fully understand the complexity, but I wouldn't - - I think just saying that this is a photo op and a hand shake thing, I - - I - - I think that's underplaying what's going to come out of it. </p><p>I think we may see some serious progress here, but the other side of the coin is the president shouldn't say that we have to make a deal or else, because that's giving up a key point of leverage here.</p><p>So, to say that he might just shake hands and walk away, I think is a part of a broader positioning game against North Korea, not just politically positioning for U.S. politics. </p><p>VAUSE:  But, Dave, we talk about leverage and positioning and all that kind of stuff, there seems to be a stunning lack of up-front commitments coming from Pyongyang ahead of this summit.  And, you know the language continues to soften on the U.S. side.</p><p>DAVE JACOBSON, CNN POLITICAL CONSULTANT:  Yes, because if Kim Jong-un is going to get a meeting with the president of the free world, essentially, that elevates him.  That's a massive score for his country, right?</p><p>In a way that we haven't seen in modern times and if Donald Trump fails to deliver anything meaningful beyond a hand shake, or perhaps just some dialog, but nothing tangible in terms of a deal for denuclearization, I think Donald Trump is going to look like a failure, because it is an expectations game.</p><p>Donald Trump is the one who didn't want the meeting, that wanted the meeting, that didn't want the meeting, now we're having the meeting again, like, something's got to get done and if he doesn't, it's going to be a big failure.</p><p>VAUSE:  Although, John, I'm just wondering if that photo op will be enough?  People will see the photograph shaking hands with Kim Jong-un and you know, in a busy world, if you don't have a lot of time for details, they'll just think, \"Hey, he did it\". </p><p>THOMAS:  Perhaps public opinion that day, but it doesn't do anything to make us more safe, and I think South Korea's not going to be pleased with just a hand shake.  So, he has to start to get something done.  I don't know that he has to get something massively, or bigly, done that day, but there has to be something in motion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>I also think what we're seeing differently with the Trump administration, we're seeing diplomacy play out on Twitter.  I mean, this is something that . . .</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>But, usually the making of the sausage is something we're not privy to, so the back and forth - - when deals are being made, although there's a high stakes deal, deals die a thousand deaths often times before they get made, we just don't see them die all those deaths. This time we're actually living it.</p><p>VAUSE:  Is that a good thing, Dave? </p><p>JACOBSON:  I don't think so.  I mean look at the juxtaposition, right? You've got Donald Trump engaging with the North Koreans over Twitter, and then alienating our allies in Canada and Mexico, or the E.U. with the supposed trade war.  I mean, it's unprecedented in conversation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Okay.  Well, the new normal, Trump's former campaign chairman could be heading to jail.  Prosecutors are trying to revoke his house arrest, accusing him of witness tampering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Saying Paul Manafort repeatedly contacted two people who worked and previously assisted in his lobbying and public relations efforts for Ukrainian politicians.  Manafort sought to secure materially false testimony concerning activities of an influential group of European leaders called the Hapsburg group, that Manafort once used to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>VAUSE:  As for the president, even before this news broke, he was throwing Manafort under the bus tweeting this, \"Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a very short period of time, he represented Ronald Regan, Bob Dole and many others over the years, but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  John, so somehow this is the fault of the former FBI Director, James Comey?  Does this president take responsibility for anything?</p><p>THOMAS:  It's a difficult thing.  I mean . . .</p><p>JACOBSON:  Translation - - no.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>THOMAS:  No, no, no it's a difficult road, because I think the president, if he had been told by the FBI, I don't think he would have hired Manafort.  </p><p>He hired Manafort because he thought he wasn't going to win the convention, he needed somebody who knew how to whip votes, and Roger Stone told him hey, Manafort's done this before and he brought him right in.  But, just to say it's the FBI's fault, I mean that doesn't make sense.  </p><p>Btu, remember all of these things that Paul is getting nailed for - - it's not about his role in the campaign and Russian collusion, yet. But, I'm just saying all of these news tightening tactics are bad actions that Paul's taken in his private business life, not campaign maneuvers.</p><p>VAUSE:  And what this all means for the possibility of Manafort getting a pardon remains unclear, but the president has no doubts about himself.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Tweeting this, \"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to pardon\" - - in all caps, \"myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats\" - - they're actually Republicans, \"and others continues into the mid- terms\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  And, Dave, the president also described the appointment of the special counsel as unconstitutional, which seems to suggest he doesn't really understand what's in the Constitution. </p><p>JACOBSON:  Right, and like the special counsel, is a Republican.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>But, look, if Donald Trump was innocent, if Donald Trump did nothing wrong, or his campaign did nothing wrong, then why would he say that the president can't obstruct justice?  Why would he say that he can pardon himself?  Why would his lawyers say that they're not going to have him testify before Bob Mueller?  </p><p>Clearly, there's something there.  They're clearly hiding something. The question is what?  And whether or not Bob Mueller's going to find that evidence and use it against the president?  Right?  But, why is going there, if he hasn't anything to hide?</p><p>VAUSE:  It does look a little odd.  John?</p><p>THOMAS:  Well, I think the president and his attorneys are just trying to protect him from a perjury trap.  I think the president knows that there was no Russian collusion, he said it a thousand times.  There has yet to be any evidence produced to date, other than processed crimes related to some of these Papadopoulos' and others, showing Russian collusion.</p><p>But, when you get - - it's like Chuck Schumer said if the FBI wants to get you, they have six different ways to Sunday to get you.</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, this first claim was made by Trump's lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that basically Trump could pardon himself and that brought out two very different responses from two Republican Senators.  First, here's Chuck Grassley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK GRASSLEY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR:  If I were the President of the United States and I had a lawyer that told me I could pardon myself, I think I'd hire a new lawyer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  And, now what was truly a priceless moment from Ted Cruz.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER:  Senator, the president says he can pardon himself.  Would you agree with that?</p><p>(PAUSE) TED CRUZ, REPUBLICAN SENATOR:  That is not a Constitutional issue I've studied, so I will withhold judgment at this point. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  John, it took him 18 seconds to come up with that dodge and that's the best he could come up with?  Seriously, he has no opinion on this?  He's a lawyer.  I mean, this is his thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMAS:  I think we need to look back at when Giuliani made those statements on what 'Meet the Press'?  He looks off to the side and laughs like well I suppose he could pardon himself, but he never would because the public opinion would immediately impeach him.  So, we're running off on this idea of whether or not he has the power . . .</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>But even Giuliani was like, if the guy ever thought about doing that, he'd be immediately impeached. </p><p>VAUSE:  Dave, what is incredibly you know astounding about Cruz, and his willingness to carry water for this president, is that during the campaign Trump essentially called his wife ugly and said his father played a role in the assassination of JFK.  I mean, the list goes on and yet Ted Cruz continues to sort of lay down for Donald Trump.</p><p>JACOBSON:  I think it's largely a function that Senator Cruz is up for reelection and he is trying to you know avoid alienating the Trump slice of the electorate, and prevent them from staying home in the upcoming general elections.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>But, he wants to be a Senator.  He wants to have - - he probably has future presidential ambitions and so he needs to be reelected in order to like put himself on that trajectory, right?  And so, I think the challenge is will those Trump voters stay home, if he goes after the president.</p><p>[01:15] But look, it's not just Ted Cruz, you've got like Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, today, came out and said they would have catastrophic implications.  Chris Christie, the former Republican Governor, who also campaigned against Donald Trump, said that it was outrageous to even think about whether or not President Trump can pardon himself.</p><p>So, there are some Republicans splitting from him, but I agree at the end of the day, like we need those Ted Cruz's of the world to stand up to the president. </p><p>VAUSE:  Giuliani did actually try to walk back that original statement a few hours ago, while appearing on CNN with Chris Cuomo.  This is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I said very theoretically the answer is the president can't be prosecuted for anything.  There's a Constitutional remedy for that, and of course that would be entirely ridiculous.  </p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST:  Right, but you could have made the point . . .</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a hypothetical that you would entertain in a law school and that's what I tried to say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  The only problem is it's not a hypothetical situation because the president is facing legal jeopardy here, and it's a very real possibility that he is actually possibly thinking about pardoning himself.  And, what many have said, and it's not a slam dunk that he can do it, because there is an opinion out there that the president is not above the law.</p><p>THOMAS:  Yes.</p><p>VAUSE:  Is the president above the law?  In this country, can he do whatever he wants?</p><p>THOMAS:  No, he can't, but at the same time in the course of doing his job, he can essentially do what he wants.  If he wants to fire people, he can fire people and his justification that he wants to fire them is pretty much all it takes.  But, he is held accountable, or can be held accountable, by the Congress.</p><p>Giuliani's problem is he is straddling this weird world where he's a spokesperson, but he's an attorney and he wants to answer as an attorney sometimes, but a disciplined messenger at others.  And, it's just weird moment - - he keeps stepping in it . . .</p><p>VAUSE:  He keeps stepping on rakes.</p><p>THOMAS:  Right.  They're self-inflicted.</p><p>VAUSE:  Totally.  </p><p>Okay.  Let's finish up here with the president starting a very public feud with the Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles.  He cancelled their trip to the White House, this is traditional for the winners to go there.  It was cancelled because a few players decided not to go and they let that be known long before the invitations went out, but here is the latest Trump Tweet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>\"The Philadelphia Eagles football team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event.  Staying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry.\"</p><p>VAUSE:  Here's a statement in response to the you know the invitation being rescinded from the mayor of Philadelphia, \"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>Dave, this is a fight the president clearly wants to have because it appeals to his base, but why does he get to decide the definition of patriotism? </p><p>JACOBSON:  He doesn't.  I mean, this is by the way, another example of Donald Trump like changing the conversation away.  Like, he should be talking about his 500 days and if I'm a Republican, my tax cuts and all these great things that I've done as Donald Trump.</p><p>He's trying to change the conversation away from that, which I just don't get.  What I found fascinating, though, was the mayor of Philadelphia, his chief of staff put out this Tweet today basically showing this juxtaposition of you know, Donald Trump's inauguration photo, versus, after the Eagles won the Super Bowl - - we've got more fans than you do, which I thought was fun.</p><p>VAUSE:  So, John, clearly you know this is a fight the president could have avoided.  But, he jumped in boots and all.  He loves this stuff and he sees it in his interest, but maybe not in the country's interest?</p><p>THOMAS:  Well, politically he won the last fight.  He's going to win this again.  He understands this is an opportunity to do an \"us versus them\" saying the American flag is bigger than the NFL, and it is, and it has been and it is a wedge.</p><p>And so, look, I think it's actually smart politics of the president and he's being consistent on this message, and anytime he has an opportunity to double down on it, he will and he'll win again.</p><p>VAUSE:  Smart politics, Dave, but is it good for the country?</p><p>JACOBSON:  No, it's further dividing the country.  I mean, this president, ever since the inception of his campaign has divided the country.   So, he's doing the complete opposite of that and I think that's the challenge is you've got these NFL players that are saying, you know, we've got a racist and a bigot in the White House, and I'm not going to step foot in it as long as Donald Trump's the president.</p><p>VAUSE:  Which is their right?</p><p>JACOBSON:  Yes, they're expressing their First Amendment right, absolutely.  But, I think the challenge is the president's supposed to be the bigger person, right?  The president is supposed to invite these national champions to come in, whether they agree with him politically or not, and be the bigger person and Donald Trump isn't capable of doing that.</p><p>VAUSE:  It's also the people's house, it's not a Trump property, just FYI.</p><p>THOMAS:  But, it's not about bowing down to Trump, it's about standing for the American flag.  It's a whole different thing.</p><p>VAUSE:  You have the last word.</p><p>[01:20] THOMAS:  But this, as you say, Trump's been dividing, he's actually been standing up to unite us saying we can disagree politically, but in this moment for the National Anthem, we should be proud to be an American, put that first.</p><p>JACOBSON:  I don't remember Donald Trump ever saying that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks, John.</p><p>Okay.  Well, still to come, many in Guatemala say their relatives have been buried alive when a volcano erupted suddenly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Engulfing villages in lava and thick clouds of ash, and throwing rocks.  More on that in a moment.</p><p>Also ahead, Apple shows off its newest bells and whistles as the company value inches closer to a major trillion dollar milestone.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE:  The Kilauea volcano is not letting up on Hawaii, the lava has now destroyed at least 117 homes in the past month alone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And, it's covering more than 2,000 acres of land.  There were about 500 tremors in the summit area over the weekend and a river of lava has entered the ocean at another base, sending a dangerous mix of acid and volcanic glass particles into the air. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  When Guatemala's Fuego volcano roared back to life without notice on Sunday, it spewed rivers of lava.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And, these huge clouds of debris, burning rocks and volcanic ash, and hot gas.  The deluge buried entire families, killing at least 69 people, but that death toll is believed that it will rise.</p><p>CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Guatemala's volcano of fire is living up to its name, after a deadly explosion that killed dozens of people, many more are wounded or are missing.  It all began on Sunday when really out of nowhere, this active volcano that has not exploded for months - - has not caused any fatalities in quite some time, suddenly came alive.</p><p>Rivers of lava came pouring down the volcano, people did not have time to flee the lava or the flying rocks that many of the village were on fire and damaged homes, whole towns were wiped out.  Even now, rescuers are having a hard time reaching many of these small towns/</p><p>People said that the people who came down the mountains were covered in ash, many of them were dazed, so they barely escaped with their lives and were worried about where their relatives are.</p><p>Guatemala's main airport was closed for several hours, has reopened, although some flights are cancelled.  Ash has been seen as far away as Guatemala City and in El Salvador.  Really, much of this region is still responding to this deadly, deadly tragedy, many more are feared dead.</p><p>[01:25] Guatemala is now in a state of mourning - - three days of mourning, and officials are concerned that more eruptions could be on the way.</p><p>Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:   Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera joins us now with more on the ongoing threats from the volcano and how the weather could play a role in all of this.</p><p>Ivan.</p><p>IVAN CABRERA, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, we'll be talking about some rain over the next couple of days and that's I think going to add additional problems here to what is already a calamity, the likes of which they haven't seen in this area, and from this particular volcano, in 40 years.  Yes, it had an eruption earlier this year, but obviously nothing like what we had on this Sunday.  </p><p>So, here's what's happening.  We have a seasonal rainy pattern, right? Typical for this time of year in Guatemala to get very heavy rain, tropical downpours, especially through the afternoon hours.  That is problematic because when rain mixes with ash, that's when we start getting in lahars - - and I'll talk about that in a second. </p><p>But, another thing that officials have been warning about as well, because of all the ash that is in the area, contamination of water supplies could be an issue over the next several days. </p><p>This is Mt. Saint Helen's, not our volcano there in Guatemala, but I'm showing you this picture because I think it really gives you a good idea of what we're talking about here, and that's just a word for mudflow, a violent one, in fact, it only occurs when you mix in water.</p><p>So, talk about tropical downpours mixing in with that volcanic ash, you could set up a violent mudflow that can essentially go through riverbeds, can be as deep as meters and also moving rather fast at around 20 to 40 kilometers per hour.</p><p>We've seen some of those mudflows, some of those lahars destroy entire communities here.  So, we're going to have to watch this very closely over the next few days.  Why?</p><p>Because of this.  We have heavy rain that's going to be on the way, not just tomorrow or the next day, John, but this is going to be an ongoing threat, I think, really right through the upcoming days, each and every day, very heavy rain on the way for the area.</p><p>VAUSE:  Okay.  That brings the problem with mudslides and a whole bunch of other stuff.</p><p>Ivan, thank you.</p><p>Well, for the first time Saudi Arabia has issued drivers licenses to women.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>Three weeks before a ban on female drivers is expected to end.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in the case of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>But, the broader debate about religious freedom is far from over.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[01:30:18] VAUSE,:  Welcome back everybody.</p><p>You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>A source tells CNN the Kim (ph) and Trump (ph) summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will be more of a meet and greet and that the goal is a broad agreement on nuclear disarmament the details of which could still take years to negotiate.</p><p>At least 69 people were killed after Guatemala's Fuego Volcano erupted Sunday with sudden speed and ferocity.  It spewed rivers of lava and these huge clouds of burning rocks and volcanic ash as well as hot gas.  The death toll is expected to rise as a number of families are missing.</p><p>Anti-austerity protests in Jordan have led to the resignation of Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki.  But demonstrators plan to keep up the pressure until a proposed income tax reform is scrapped.  The International Monetary Fund supported the law (ph) aimed at cutting Jordan's massive public debt.  King Abdullah has tapped a former World Bank economist to form a new government.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple.  Jack Phillips said it was against his religious beliefs.  And the couple accused him of violating anti- discrimination laws.</p><p>But in a very specific ruling the Court said the state of Colorado showed hostility towards Phillips based on his beliefs.  The Court did not settle the larger constitutional question of religious liberty versus discrimination.</p><p>Well criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool joins me now for more on this.  It's good to see you -- Brian.  Thanks for coming in.</p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Hey -- John.  Yes, thanks.</p><p>VAUSE:  It was interesting.  This case was litigated over grounds of freedom of speech but at the end of the day the opinion written by Justice Kennedy seemed to sort of address the problem of bias -- remember the case was initially heard by Colorado's Civil Rights Commission.</p><p>Kennedy wrote that one commissioner had crossed the line when he said freedom of religion has been used just like all kinds of discrimination throughout history whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust.  This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and mutual enforcement of Colorado's anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>But overall it seems, the Court made it fairly clear that the states are allowed to force businesses, whatever that business is, whether it's a cake shop or anything else, that they have to serve all customers -- gays, lesbians, everyone -- which I guess in the big picture here the cake shop owner he may have won the battle but he loses the war.</p><p>CLAYPPOOL:  Yes John -- in my opinion the U.S. Supreme Court punted. This was a great opportunity for the Court to rule on the clash between faith and first amendment rights and discrimination.</p><p>And instead of reaching an opinion that addressed that issue they used, in my opinion, a collateral issue to rule on this.  By collateral, what I mean is well, one of the Civil Rights Commission members made a comment about religion -- </p><p>VAUSE:  And religious beliefs -- </p><p>CLAYPOOL:  -- yes, religious beliefs being used as a propeller for discrimination.  But that wasn't really the issue here.  The issue to me was whether these, the bakers -- Jack Phillips, the baker -- whether he was losing his right, his belief in religion, and his first amendment right at the expense of discrimination?  </p><p>VAUSE:  Why do you think they punted?  </p><p>CLAYPOOL:  They didn't want to rule on this issue.</p><p>VAUSE:  Why?  </p><p>CLAYPOOL:  It is a tough issue.  Let's break it down for example.  The first issue that I talk about is whether baking a cake is even protected by the First Amendment.  We haven't even talked about that. You know, I would argue as a civil rights lawyer, too, that it is not.</p><p>The reason why is these bakers have a right to go out and protest. They could still argue against gay rights.  And in fact, these bakers, they declined the gay couple before they even talked about the creative aspect of the cake.  So in my opinion the cake is not even first amendment.</p><p>But even if it is, you then have to look at an issue of whether that somehow squares with the law.  You mentioned it.  There is a law, John -- there is a law in Colorado.  It makes it categorically clear that you cannot discriminate against someone based on sexual orientation. And clearly that's what I think happened here.</p><p>VAUSE:  David Cole -- excuse me -- he represented the gay couple.  He wrote an op-ed in the \"Washington Post\", and that's his opinion, that Colorado's Commission's ruling -- initial ruling was well within the law.  He wrote \"The commission's statement that one cannot invoke religion to harm others is actually black-letter constitutional law as is the notion that one cannot invoke religion to avoid complying with the general rule requiring businesses not to discriminate based on the Supreme Court itself did just that in the 1990 Employment Division versus Smith case.\"</p><p>So even if the commission was biased in some way or one commissioner held these beliefs and was sort of biased -- what does that matter if the decision is still within the law?  </p><p>[01:35:00] CLAYPOOL:  You're absolutely right.  The Supreme Court using the bias of the commission is a complete cop-out.</p><p>The fact of the matter is this.  In 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.  So are you telling me that gays can legally marry but yet they can walk into a bakery now and they can be discriminated against?</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  Those two principles are at odds.  And that's why I think this Supreme Court did not want to address this issue square on.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Ok.  Well, there was this bigger question about discrimination versus religious freedom.  And the Court -- part of the opinion is this.  \"It is a general rule that religious and philosophical objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a mutual and generally- applicable public accommodations law.\"</p><p>Ok.  So having that there -- having said that now, if Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the couple who wanted the cake, if they turned up back at the master -- what is it -- Masterpiece Cake Shop, placed the same order.  Is it true to say that the owner Jack Phillips he would not have a first amendment right to turn them away at this point?  Or is that still yet to be settled?</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  No.  It hasn't been settled.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  Here's what I would do.  This is what I would recommend.  I recommend that a gay -- any gay couple walk into the same bakery tomorrow and they order a wedding cake, and have Jack Phillips deny the cake and then let's have a commission in Colorado not make these comments -- </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  -- about discrimination, religion being used as discrimination.  Have them be on the up and up, issue their ruling and then that forces the U.S. Supreme Court then to really come to head with this issue.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  And in fact, the governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper said that, you know, that's what they'll be looking at with this commission.  There was some soaring language in this opinion piece by Kennedy when it comes to the recognition of gay rights.</p><p>How society comes to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.  For that reason the laws and the constitution can and in some instances must protect them and the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.\"</p><p>You know, so you've got this opinion here which seems to be at odds with the ultimate decision siding with the owner of the cake shop.  At the end of the day, given what he has written here, if there is another case that goes forward how much weigh does that sort of stuff carry.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  Well, it's not going to carry as much weight.</p><p>VAUSE:  Right.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  Here is what's going to happen.  This is going to come up again -- </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  -- in the very near future.  And we're not going to have any excuse for the Supreme Court to avoid making a decision that's based on the real issues.</p><p>We don't have a ruling today -- John, based on the real issues because the first amendment does not give you a right to violate the law.  And that's exactly what happened here.  You can't come up with some religious idea that all of a sudden, it is against my religion -- </p><p>VAUSE:  To serve black people -- </p><p>CLAYPOOL:  -- what about white people?  And of a sudden, all white people go into a bakery can't get a cake?  That just is squarely at odds with the fundamentals in our society -- of civil rights, constitutional rights.  </p><p>VAUSE:  And as you say, it was a great chance to resolve this issue. And forever whatever that is -- I guess it will be settled one way or the other.  </p><p>CLAYPOOL:  We're going to see this again where the cake is going to clash with faith.  That's going to happen again.  We're going to see it soon.</p><p>VAUSE:  You can't have your faith cake and eat your cake -- you know, I guess we'll find out.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  I think so.</p><p>VAUSE:  Thanks -- Brian.</p><p>CLAYPOOL:  All right.  Thanks for having me -- John.</p><p>VAUSE:  Pleasure.</p><p>Next here on NEWSROOM L.A., Apple's CEO talks cell phone addiction and what a trade war with China could mean for the cost of an iPhone. [01:38:39] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Welcome back everybody.</p><p>Apple is on the verge of becoming the first trillion-dollar company as executives showed off the newest software upgrades on Monday Apple stock rose again pushing it closer to that milestone.  CEO Tim Cook sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall about Apple's future.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there.</p><p>Well, a lot of excitement today.  You have over 5,000 developers here for the developer conference.  This is where we hear a lot about the latest features we'll see on our phone in the next coming months.</p><p>One feature in particular that was really interesting and almost unexpected was a tech addiction tool.  It's aimed at helping us use our phones less and taking control back.  It's called Screen Time.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down with Tim cook who cares a lot about tech and humanity and spoke to me specifically about this.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL:  You guys announced a tech addiction tool that will almost help us limit our screen time.  So what is the thinking behind that?  </p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Well you know, we've never been focused on usage as a key parameter.  We want people to be incredibly satisfied and empowered by our devices that we ship (ph).  But we've never wanted people to spend a lot of time on them or all of their time on them.</p><p>And you know, it is a personal thing as to how much is too much.  We thought a lot about this and we're rolling out great tools to both make people aware of how much time they're spending and the apps that they're spending them in but also how many times they pick up their point.  How many notifications they get?   Who is sending them the notifications?  </p><p>SEGALL:  So tell me about your own tech habits.</p><p>COOK:  Yes.  I've been using it and I have to tell you I thought I was fairly disciplined about this.  And I was wrong.  When I began to get the data, I found I was spending a lot more time than I should.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Like where?  </p><p>COOK:  Well, I don't want to give you all the apps but just too much. And the number of times I picked up the phone were too many.  </p><p>SEGALL:  What do you tell people who are worried they're addicted to their smart phones who are worried about tech's impact on children?   COOK:  I think ultimately, each person has to make the decision when they get their numbers as to what they would like to do.  And I encourage everyone to look and everyone to make an informed decision and ask themselves if they're picking up their phone 10 times an hour or 20 times an hour maybe they could do it less.</p><p>I think the power is now shifted to the user.  And that's just been what Apple has always been about is giving the power from the institution to the user.  </p><p>SEGALL:  It's so interesting because there is this idea, who is control?  Man or machine.  You believe that we as human beings, we can control -- </p><p>COOK:  I absolutely do.  I don't subscribe to the machines taking over the world.  And I don't worry about that.  I worry much more about people thinking like machines than machines thinking like people.  </p><p>SEGALL:  What do you mean?  That's interesting.  What do you mean?</p><p>COOK:  I mean forgetting the humanity in things, forgetting that all of our products should be infused with humanity.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I get the sense that that feels very personal to you -- what you just said.  </p><p>COOK:  It does.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Why?  </p><p>COOK:  Because it's the reason I'm on the face of the earth.  It makes it really personal, right that this is the role I play.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?  </p><p>COOK:  Generally, for me I'm not a big fan of regulation.  I think self-regulation is the best.  But when it's not working and in some cases it's not work, you have to ask yourself so what form of regulation might be good?  </p><p>[01:45:01] SEGALL:  What kind do you think isn't working?</p><p>COOK:  Well, I think that the privacy thing has gotten totally out of control.  And I think most people are not aware of who is tracking them, how much they're being tracked, and sort of the large amounts of detailed data that are out there about them.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy? Is it a luxury at this point?  </p><p>COOK:  No.  To me -- and we feel this very deeply -- we think privacy a fundamental human right.  So that is the angle that we look at it. Privacy from an American point of view is one of these key civil liberties that's define what it is to be American.  </p><p>SEGALL:  It's a fundamental human right.  Do you think the last year has shown that that fundamental human right could be under attack?  </p><p>COOK:  I think it has been under attack.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple.  As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?</p><p>COOK:  Well, I haven't read the opinion and so I reserve the right to read that and deeply understand.  It was very prominent (ph).</p><p>But in terms of the general topic, we believe that everybody should treat everybody else with dignity and respect.  And that's how we run our company.  That's what we expect of each other and that pertains to all communities including the LGBTQ community.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I know that there is this fear (ph) -- the impact on consumers and will iPhone prices go up if there's an escalated trade war?  I'd be curious to know -- I know you said you're optimistic before.  Are you still optimistic?  </p><p>COOK:  I am.  I am very optimistic because no one will win from that. It will be a lose-lose.</p><p>SEGALL:  Do you think that if that were to occur, that iPhone prices could go up? </p><p>COOK:  I don't think that iPhone will get a tariff on it is my belief. Based on what I've been told and what I see, I just don't see that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL:  And here at this conference, you have developers from over 70 different countries.  So immigration is in the DNA of Apple.  It is why you'll hear Tim speak very openly about immigration practices. And you know, at a very fascinating moment in time and technology where we're talking about tech addiction, we're talking about privacy and politics because at this moment, technology is the underlayer to society.</p><p>And you very much see the CEO looking to step into a role to just go beyond, you know, just tech's impact on this whole feature (ph) but also on society.  He said, you know, he feels a much larger obligation.  He says it's why he's here on this earth.</p><p>Back to you.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Laurie Segall -- thank you for that.</p><p>Global business executive Bryan Patel joins me for more now on Apple and the rise and rise of the Apple stock.</p><p>Well, it's interesting Apple opened its annual conference for developers on Monday and the stock price actually went up. (INAUDIBLE) a historical trend it was only going down over the last 14, 15 years.  The stock closed at $191.83 was up almost 1 percent. But to reach this magic tree in dollar mark, it is kind of a little iffy, you know.  But basically the stock price reached somewhere around $202.30.  So given, you know, what we know of Apple, its performance, you know, the last couple years -- what is that a matter of weeks, a matter of months.  I mean how long before we get there? $60 billion come on -- how hard is that.</p><p>BRYAN PATEL, GLOBAL BUSINESS EXECUTIVE:  Listen -- I think that's underestimated.  Everyone thinks like, you know we're joking about it. But I think -- they're going to get to the $60 billion mark.</p><p>It wasn't until a few years ago where analysts were going after them saying where's your new product?  Where's your new product.  This is going to go down. </p><p>What has changed is their service?  People are focusing on things at their higher margin items and they've kind of diversified to some other different things.  So I believe -- I think they're going to get there probably faster than the competitors or anyone else nearby.  And I think they've been really smart of how they've been growing their platform.  </p><p>VAUSE:  The most important issue I guess isn't really when Apple reaches this milestone.  It's just a number.  At the end of the day it doesn't mean a whole lot.  What is far more important is essentially, you know, how is the company run as you say?  Can it continue to grow? Can it continue to produce revenue?</p><p>PATEL:  Well, here's the thing.  We kind of joke about how the Apple Watches didn't really go off with a hitch.  But you think about, you know, the air pods, right?  High margins, high in demand -- </p><p>VAUSE:  They forced everyone to get them because they got rid of the jack.  It wasn't really innovation.</p><p>PATEL:  Wall Street loves what -- service models.  They love money and they love companies -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PATEL:  Apple has transformed themselves, not just to be a hardware company.</p><p>VAUSE:  Right.</p><p>PATEL:  And they moved toward this so that means their valuation and the potential higher up is going to go.</p><p>Now, they didn't invent the wireless head phone but they are finding ways for you to have it stay in with the Apple family.  It's no different from some other companies like Amazon and right that's what they've done too.</p><p>VAUSE:  It's very clever stuff which basically if Apple gets to this trillion-dollar mark, if it was a country it would have the 17th biggest economy in the world, which is kind of terrifying to think that you know, this company has that much power. [01:49:58] How much though is that to do with the nature of the stock market today?  With, you know, surging prices -- and you know, is it simply that, you know, trillion-dollar companies are just not that special?  It's something to be expected in this, you know, current set up.</p><p>PATEL:  You know, I hate to say yes because I think they've worked -- I think out of all the companies, Apple has gotten a lot of scrutiny over the last few years to get to where they got to and to get to that number is a special number.  But yes.</p><p>I think you're expecting, you are always expecting what are they doing next?  How they streamline things?  There's always going to be behind them, right.  And I think know we're focusing, ok, $1 trillion -- we're not even there yet, we're already going -- </p><p>VAUSE:  Big deal.</p><p>PATEL:  Big deal, who's next.</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, I guess because back in the 1980s IBM, you know, this huge company that now is pretty much nothing.  It has already been broken up and sold off.  It had 60 percent of the S&amp;P.  If that was in today's market that would be worth what $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion. And look a IBM.  </p><p>PATEL:  Exactly.  And things change.  I mean you were talking about how big Apple is.  We're now talking about just a service section of Apple is as big as Indonesia's GDP, right.  And that's a whole different animal. </p><p>And I think that's where I think you're going to have to focus.  Apple is -- I don't think they're sitjng here thinking that they're talking about hardware and service.  They have to have a platform to keep getting the consumers to come and especially millennials and Gen-Zs who are going to outrank the Baby Boomers as well.  </p><p>VAUSE:  The next closest company is Amazon in market cap.  Microsoft has actually overtaken Google to move into third place which is kind of a total reversal of fortune for Microsoft but again it's because they've got this diversified stream of revenue which is where Apple has gone as well.  </p><p>PATEL:  It's amazing, right.  I mean Microsoft has done a fantastic job.  And you think of what Amazon -- what Amazon has done and Microsoft is doing, one word -- Cloud.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.</p><p>PATEL:  They're focusing on the Cloud.  That's where -- I mean they've got other things going on but and that's where the higher margins are going to live there and I think that's where it's going to be a race to see who gets there first.  </p><p>VAUSE:  And not a coal company among them.  Big tech company -- go figure.  It's the future. Bryan -- thank you.  Good to see you.</p><p>VAUSE:  Ok, a short break.</p><p>When we come back when it comes to the Russia investigation, Donald Trump's lawyers says our recollection keeps changing.</p><p>Well, Rudy Giuliani isn't doing much better remembering names as well. We'll explain in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, as the song goes, sometimes a kiss is just a kiss but sometimes that is not a case when it comes from the Philippine president.  A spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte says the president's kiss of a woman on stage was an act of endearment towards Filipino workers. Mr. Duterte had delivered a speech to expatriate Filipinos in Seoul, South Korea.  Then he invited two women on stage to give them a book in exchange for kisses.  Opponents call the move misogynistic as well as an abuse of power.</p><p>[01:54:54] Sometimes sitting down for an interview on live television could be a little nerve-wracking; some struggle to get their facts straight, others can't seem to get the names right, either.</p><p>Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Before you meet the press, it is best to know who you're meeting and host Chuck Todd is one of those last names that sounds like a first name leaving Rudy Giuliani flummoxed.  </p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, TRUMP ATTORNEY:  It's nice to be with you -- Todd.  How are you?</p><p>CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS HOST:  I'm ok.  Let me start -- </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris.</p><p>TODD:  It's ok.</p><p>MOOS:  No Chris on this show either.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not playing baseball.</p><p>TODD:  Fair enough.  But we won't do the last names, Giuliani, right?  </p><p>MOOS:  Tweeted one viewer, \"So his new name is Todd Chris.  Nice ring to it.\"</p><p>Also a nice ring to the name Senator Harry Reid once blurted out for Wolf Blitzer.  </p><p>HARRY REID (D), FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  First of all, Blitz, the first --  MOOS:  And how about the blitz of Tims President Obama once launched at Matt Lauer-- </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well Tim -- I think that -- </p><p>Well, I think what it is, Tim -- </p><p>Well, Tim, first of all.  </p><p>MOOS:  Finally Matt couldn't take another Tim.  </p><p>MATT LAUER, FORMER MSNBC HOST:  I just want to say -- I know you've had a very long week and so have I.  You're saying Tim.  I know -- it's Matt Lauer, but I -- believe me I completely understand.  </p><p>OBAMA:  I'm sorry.  </p><p>MOOS:  But who -- who could call a former president, President Nixon by another president's name to his face no less.  Some rookie reporter -- that would be me 34 years ago.  </p><p>President Reagan -- sorry, President Nixon.  </p><p>RICHARD NIXON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've been called worse than that.  </p><p>MOOS:  You know what's worse?  When Osama becomes Obama.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Obama bin Laden is still at large.</p><p>OBAMA:  I think that was Osama bin Laden.</p><p>MOOS:  And it was even worse when a sports anchor intentionally used a female tennis star's player's name Chris Evert to goad then quarterback Jim Everett.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Chris?  </p><p>MOOS:  A quarterback sat the host.  The subconscious makes some weird links like between Lincoln and Clinton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The 41st president of the United States, President Jefferson William Lincoln.</p><p>MOOS:  But politicians and anchors tend to answer to anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Blitz -- </p><p>OSAMA:  Well Tim -- first of all.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It's nice to be with you -- Todd.  </p><p>MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN -- </p><p>President Reagan -- sorry, President Nixon.   -- New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  It gets a little confusing.
