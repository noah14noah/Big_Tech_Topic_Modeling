They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2071530585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-97J1-DY0W-43Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Jul 9, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 13</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2071530585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-97G1-DY0W-415T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Jul 9, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 13</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2071530585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-9721-DY0W-4455-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Jul 9, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 13</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2071530585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-9721-JBHT-D0XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Jul 9, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 13</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[3]Can you tell us about your background?I've been working in the industry for thirteen years - largely in service management and product management, as well as in sales. I've been with Telstra for seven years, initially joining for unified communications and applications both in sales and product management. For the past four years, I have been responsible for the productization of our connectivity backbone, including our cable systems, as well as the platforms that go across Telstra's network. I've been doing that for the last four years in product management and that encompasses a lot of international products that we sell outside of Australia[4].What does your company do?Telstra has been operating internationally for more than 30 years and has spent the past 25 years operating in the US - largely via cables. Telstra operates in US, London, France and Germany, but is very strong in Asia-Pacific, with offices in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangalore and Hong Kong, our main Asian headquarters. One of the biggest value-added services Telstra provides is trans-pacific connectivity. In the US, Telstra provides services to media and content providers, as well as enterprise customers (high frequency and financial services customers). Telstra also works with companies who need satellite connectivity[5] into Australia. A lot of the US-based revenue, more than 90%, is connectivity, whether satellite or cables, from US to Asia and US to Australia. You write the new service reduces restoration time on cables from eight hours to just minutes by automatically rerouting traffic. Can you explain that to us? How does that impact regular users? We have the Golden Triangle - the paths between Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Four years ago, Telstra acquired PacNet, and in this acquisition[6], obtained ownership of their cables, which gave us three paths in each link in the Golden Triangle. Generally, service providers will give a protected or unprotected service. If a cable gets cut with an unprotected service, they have to wait until service is restored. Protected service gives them access to other lines. Our Always On service allows customers to restore service to another cable route in a matter of minutes without customers having to pay a premium for protected service. We can do this because of technology and partners like CNF, which allows us to reroute cable traffic to another because of the technology on the boxes the cables use.Who owns these cables and who builds them?Telstra owns the end-to-end cable landing stations in the Golden Triangle. In some instances, we are part of a larger consortium and are an equity shareholder. A couple examples of this are cables from Japan to the US and Hong Kong to the US. Partners could be anyone form media content providers to other carriers. To recap, Telstra has both fully-owned and consortium-owned cables.Have any of the big tech giants gotten involved? If not, why? It seems like it would be a natural monopoly.The media and content providers are big tech giants[7]. We have good partnerships with three major players in which they're either involved in ownership or they buy spectrum from us, but they are also actively investing in cable systems.In the dot-com era we saw some major boom and busts specifically related to underwater cables.Do you think this time is different?Yes. Strategic partnerships with carriers and big tech giants who are still investing in cables helps make it different this time around. The cables we own have been around for a while, and they've been able to maintain them because of investment. Cost of maintaining and repairing cables has gone down as well, and this has increased the longevity of cables. Because of that, and the strategic partnerships with content and service providers, it has helped the economy of cables going forward. We have plans to launch three new transpacific cables in the coming years and are able to do that because of these strategic partnerships.Are these cables for internet? Phone lines? Telegraphs/faxes? Any connection to 5G?Internet is the major service provided by these cables. We are launching 5G in Australia, which requires mobile roaming. 5G and mobile roaming, from an IT perspective, are dependent on these cables. Any internet connection from a country to another country is dependent on these cables, and 5G[8] from an IT layer is dependent on cable capacity as well.Bloomberg had an interesting article[9] about underwater cables and security. Who owns these?Every cable owner and cable consortium owner is responsible for the security and physical integrity of their cable. At Telstra, we know the physical integrity of the cable is absolute, and that is the remit we have, whether its's full ownership or consortium ownership.Can China install backdoors to the cables in the golden triangle?Any cable owner has to uphold regulations in every country that each cable lands. So, any consortium owner, or any owner of the cable landing in those countries[10], has to adhere to the laws in the country where the cable resides. The integrity of the physical build of the cable is dependent on the regulations of the country where it's connected to. As Telstra, we have really stringent adherence to the regulations in these countries, which has made us a trusted partner for cable builds.What other security issues do they have?In my experience, we have not come across security issues because of the integrity and the physical integrity of the build of the cable and the adherence to regulations in various countries. That becomes an absolute - before any party is allowed to become part of a consortium, they have to adhere to a code of conduct. In that sense, we have not seen security issues because the physical integrity of the cable is regulated.Any final thoughts?Telstra, being a company that has been investing in cables for over 30 years, is the leader when you look at golden triangle (Asia-Pacific[11]) and transpacific cables. Not just from a Telstra perspective, but from an industry point of view. The knowledge and expertise we have within our company on cable builds, from lead services to IP to internet and more is imperative. We also own a lot of the fastest speeds and lowest latencies on the networks. For example, this technology has benefitted a lot of financial service companies as we have eight routes within Asia and between the US and Asia that provide the fastest connection between international stocks and exchanges. This capability is partly because of the acquisition of PacNet, which enabled us to create a value-add and identify a new customer base that would purchase services top of pure cable capacity. We've been able to accomplish that with media, content and technology providers, and we've been able to do that with financial service customers.

The survey \"found that banks were more likely to say they planned to tighten standards than to loosen them almost across the board because of unexpected deterioration in the quality of those loans, meaning borrowers could be more likely to default,\" the paper says. \"They also pointed to lower tolerance for risk and a deterioration in the value of collateral this year.\"</p><p>\"In particular, about 30% of lenders said they expected to see more delinquencies among subprime credit-card borrowers this year, and about 27% forecast more delinquencies among subprime car loans.

The project - which is likely to involve attaching Goldman's brand to the Amazon product in some way - could go live as soon as March, one of them said.</p><p>Last week Goldman's chief executive David Solomon promised shareholders the bank would boost returns by winning revenues from new sources such as consumer banking and wealth management.</p><p>An agreement with Amazon would follow March's announcement of a credit card partnership with Apple, a tie-up which features the bank's branding on the physical card and in some marketing and gives Goldman a direct channel to Apple's more than 100 million US subscribers. </p><p>Executives at Goldman, which lacks the physical branch network that most banks use to attract SME customers, have described the Apple Card as the \"most successful credit card launch ever\". </p><p>Card lending is understood to account for a significant portion of the $7 billion (EUR 6.3 billion) of consumer loans and card balances the bank had at the end of last year. Goldman also offers consumer lending in the US through Marcus, its retail banking arm.</p><p>Amazon had outstanding small business loans of more than $863 million (EUR 780 million) on its own balance sheet at the end of 2019. For the past eight years it has lent to small businesses that sell on its site, using the data it holds on their cash positions to offer quick-decision loans in a handful of countries. </p><p>But Amazon Lending's growth has been patchy in recent years, and the tech company now uses bank partnerships in some markets outside the US. </p><p>John Cronin, an analyst at Goodbody's, said banking partnerships could allow Amazon to \"significantly extend\" its SME lending platform \"without any associated credit risk of regulatory obligations [in the context of capital and liquidity and so forth]\".</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the Goldman deal and said lending was \"part of the services, tools, programs and infrastructure we provide to our selling partners, mostly small and medium-sized businesses, who account for more than half of everything sold in Amazon's stores\".</p><p>A spokesman for Goldman also declined to comment.</p><p>Goldman is in the midst of a dramatic transformation from a trading and investment banking powerhouse to a broader financial services group that more closely resembles that of rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. - The Financial Times Limited</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4160933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4G-R141-JC8Y-834V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

And now, Goldman Sachs' equity strategists have flagged another source of volatility that's set to be amplified in the coming months.Nearly halfway into 2018, it's become even clearer that the calm that enveloped the stock market in 2017 was far from normal.US trade policy, inflation fears, and big-tech regulation are just a few of the issues that have rocked markets this year. Goldman Sachs is now flagging another potential source of volatility on the horizon: the US midterm elections[1] on November6, when seats in the House of Representatives and Senate will be contested. </p><p>\"Policy uncertainty and equity volatility usually register above average during midterm election years, rising in particular during the three months ahead of the election,\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist, said in a note on Thursday. \"US equities typically trade sideways during this period but rally around the election as uncertainty fades. Upcoming elections are one reason to expect that current elevated levels of uncertainty will persist in coming months.\"This year, Republicans will contest to hold on to their majority seats in both chambers of Congress. They're looking to avoid what happened to Democrats in 2010[2], when Republicans took over the House. Kostin noted prediction market data compiled by PredictIt.org, which suggests that Democrats will win the House, but Republicans will keep their Senate majority, creating a divided government. \"The current political environment suggests that uncertainty and volatility may remain elevated post-election given the likelihood that a divided government leads to an increase in congressional investigations,\" Kostin said. While Kostin forecasts more volatile markets leading up to the election, there's much less clarity on where stocks could go after it. S...00[3] returns have varied widely following Democratic victories relative to Republican wins in the House. Also, a minority party has flipped the House in only three out of the last 11 midterm elections, so there's not much historical precedent for what prediction markets are betting on.And so, Kostin cautioned that investors shouldn't rely on the small sample of sector returns around midterm election years. \"Historical correlations with policy uncertainty may be a more useful guide,\" he said, adding that defensive sectors tend to outperform when policy uncertainty rises, while tech and financials perform the worst. Three specific issues will be in focus before and after election day, Kostin said: healthcare costs and drug pricing, government spending, and deregulation.NOW WATCH: Wall Street's biggest bull

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID SOLOMON, CO-PRESIDENT, GOLDMAN SACHS, IS INTERVIEWED ON BLOOMBERG TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAY 1, 2017</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: DAVID SOLOMON, CO-PRESIDENT, GOLDMAN SACHS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] SCHATZKER: I'm here with David Solomon. He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs. David, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOLOMON: Good morning, Erik. Nice to be here with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCHATZKER: Nice to see you again. We'll begin with the obvious. I think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a rough first quarter. It's a trading business back on track.</p><p>SOLOMON: Our trading business is a great franchise. We work very, very hard, you know, to serve our clients. Clearly, we didn't meet expectations in the first quarter. You know, although, when you look at the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities divisions, all performed in line. The FICC, you know, FICC did not. So look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest, tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good about our client franchise and our position in the business.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close look, what conclusions have you drawn?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us. But look, we could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount. And, you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have. We're in certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the commodities business, et cetera.</p><p>And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different result than others. But we've got a really terrific franchise. I obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings. But when I look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses are positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Are those positions still losing money?</p><p>SOLOMON: There -- there are positions that are losing money. You -- you kind of pop that right in. I assume you're referring to the article, the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg wrote. I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that. This was not a quarter that was defined by positions losing money. This was a quarter that was defined by lower client activity. And the firm, not maximizing the revenue opportunity. But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money, more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do with, say, a risk management problem?</p><p>SOLOMON: No, there's absolutely no risk management problem. That was not what defined that the quarter at all. This was a quarter that was defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction. I think one of the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade, and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER: You know why we're talking about this. We're talking about it for two principal reasons. One is Goldman has a record, a track record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade ...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON: Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter. OK? It's not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER: It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>SOLOMON: But it happened this quarter. We've got a terrific franchise. We feel very good about our franchise. There's no risk management issue. We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOMON: ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER: We know. Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business. And, you know, our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for your clients over a long period of time, good things happen. And we feel very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER: FICC is getting all the attention. But equities wasn't the star performer it's been in the past either. Five years ago, Goldman's equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan Stanley's is bigger. What happened?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah. Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely, the businesses are weighted in different ways. We have a leading institutional equity franchise. We've got a strong position across institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage. But one of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in quants. And there are variety of reasons. It's a business that's grown very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that business. And that ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: What do you do about it?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in. But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business. There's lots of operational risks in that business. And while we're investing in it, we want to be in that business. You know, we -- we're -- we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that business, but we're building up that capability. And Morgan Stanley has a platform of quants that's a little bit larger. But if you look at the institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Can you take some of that market share and quant away from Morgan Stanley?</p><p>SOLOMON: I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those clients. We're focused on that.</p><p>SCHATZKER: How?</p><p>SOLOMON: By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive. Now, we started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>SCHATZKER: At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error. I would say it was a choice that was made. You know, you only see over time how all these businesses run. And look, part of this -- we're not always just looking for revenue in these businesses. We're also looking for returns. OK? And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance. And so, you know, I know that you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error. You know, we've run our business. We have a leading equity franchise. We're very focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set over a long period of time.</p><p>We're focused on returns. We're focused on servicing our clients. And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different investments. But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>SOLOMON: That was -- that was a once upon a time. I still watch that market very closely.</p><p>SCHATZKER: I'm sure you do. There is a lot of that capital available for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose, would you agree?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you know, robust levels. You know, I think when I look just over the weekend, we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market, obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving into. But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>And the pricing, you know, very, very tight. So we're in a relatively robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of supply. And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been pressed that significantly. So ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged finance?</p><p>SOLOMON: Absolutely. We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk management culture. Leveraged finance business, and important business to service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had. We -- we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see at this point in time. There actually hasn't been as much of that activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like to see.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So I'm going to do something which you would probably consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>SOLOMON: OK.</p><p>SCHATZKER: OK. Charter NEX. This is a packaging company that Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the junior financing. $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>SOLOMON: So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds, you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very, very wide margin. But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels very, very good about our risk management processes around this product. We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have to have a strong risk management culture. And I'm sure we have a team that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view about the distribution capability of the transaction. And, you know, we're very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>SCHATZKER: In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like 2007.</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007. Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance. None of these things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating in a transaction. So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite constructive, and it's something to watch. It's always a space to watch. But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that running. A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment here. And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: You raised an important point. Do you believe sitting here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question like that. I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look historically. However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market. A lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here. And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good. If you look at earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>SCHATZKER: And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>SOLOMON: And analysts are raising estimates. Now, we've only seen kind of half the picture. We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph), energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset prices in markets. You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people kind of hanging in. And, you know, we'll have to watch and see. Do we get some momentum on the policy side? Can we get tax reform in some way? All that could be constructive.</p><p>So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment. If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated matrix. But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more movement in that. But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's -- that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the last few months.</p><p>SCHATZKER: David, so good to see you.</p><p>SOLOMON: Always good to see you.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Thanks for your time.</p><p>SOLOMON: Thanks for your time. (Inaudible).</p><p>SCHATZKER: Oliver, that's David Solomon. He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs.  David, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOLOMON:  Good morning, Erik.  Nice to be here with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCHATZKER:  Nice to see you again.  We'll begin with the obvious.  I  think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a  rough first quarter.  It's a trading business back on track.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Our trading business is a great franchise.  We work very,  very hard, you know, to serve our clients.  Clearly, we didn't meet  expectations in the first quarter.  You know, although, when you look at  the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities  divisions, all performed in line.  The FICC, you know, FICC did not.  So  look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's  going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest,  tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were  presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good  about our client franchise and our position in the business.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close  look, what conclusions have you drawn?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the  quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given  our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at  the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us.  But look, we  could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount.  And,  you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work  with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have.  We're in  certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the  commodities business, et cetera.</p><p>And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different  result than others.  But we've got a really terrific franchise.  I  obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings.  But when I  look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our  people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses  are positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Are those positions still losing money?</p><p>SOLOMON:  There -- there are positions that are losing money.  You --  you kind of pop that right in.  I assume you're referring to the article,  the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg  wrote.  I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that.  This was not a quarter  that was defined by positions losing money.  This was a quarter that was  defined by lower client activity.  And the firm, not maximizing the revenue  opportunity.  But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money,  more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this  discussion.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do  with, say, a risk management problem?</p><p>SOLOMON:  No, there's absolutely no risk management problem.  That was  not what defined that the quarter at all.  This was a quarter that was  defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one  of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or  levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction.  I think one of  the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed  and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the  election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade,  and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  You know why we're talking about this.  We're talking  about it for two principal reasons.  One is Goldman has a record, a track  record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of  course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade  ...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON:  Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter.  OK?  It's  not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER:  It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>SOLOMON:  But it happened this quarter.  We've got a terrific  franchise.  We feel very good about our franchise.  There's no risk  management issue.  We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're  doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOMON:  ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  We know.  Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't  meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business.  And, you know,  our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their  clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you  just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend  time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for  your clients over a long period of time, good things happen.  And we feel  very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  FICC is getting all the attention.  But equities wasn't  the star performer it's been in the past either.  Five years ago, Goldman's  equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan  Stanley's is bigger.  What happened?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yeah.  Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely,  the businesses are weighted in different ways.  We have a leading  institutional equity franchise.  We've got a strong position across  institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage.  But one  of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in  quants.  And there are variety of reasons.  It's a business that's grown  very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that  business.  And that ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  What do you do about it?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in.   But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business.   There's lots of operational risks in that business.  And while we're  investing in it, we want to be in that business.  You know, we -- we're --  we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that  business, but we're building up that capability.  And Morgan Stanley has a  platform of quants that's a little bit larger.  But if you look at the  institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very  significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Can you take some of that market share and quant away from  Morgan Stanley?</p><p>SOLOMON:  I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that  we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those  clients.  We're focused on that.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  How?</p><p>SOLOMON:  By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our  offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last  year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive.  Now, we  started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's  something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a  strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error.  I would  say it was a choice that was made.  You know, you only see over time how  all these businesses run.  And look, part of this -- we're not always just  looking for revenue in these businesses.  We're also looking for returns.   OK?  And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance.  And so, you know, I know that  you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error.  You know,  we've run our business.  We have a leading equity franchise.  We're very  focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our  returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set  over a long period of time.</p><p>We're focused on returns.  We're focused on servicing our clients.   And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different  investments.  But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully  make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may  forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>SOLOMON:  That was -- that was a once upon a time.  I still watch that  market very closely.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  I'm sure you do.  There is a lot of that capital available  for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose,  would you agree?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance  market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you  know, robust levels.  You know, I think when I look just over the weekend,  we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big  momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market,  obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving  into.  But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a  low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>And the pricing, you know, very, very tight.  So we're in a relatively  robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of  supply.  And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory  environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been  pressed that significantly.  So ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which  is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged  finance?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Absolutely.  We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk  management culture.  Leveraged finance business, and important business to  service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our  leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had.  We --  we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see  at this point in time.  There actually hasn't been as much of that  activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like  to see.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So I'm going to do something which you would probably  consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>SOLOMON:  OK.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  OK.  Charter NEX.  This is a packaging company that  Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the  junior financing.  $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance  sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a  PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>SOLOMON:  So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds,  you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very,  very wide margin.  But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels  very, very good about our risk management processes around this product.   We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of  the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have  to have a strong risk management culture.  And I'm sure we have a team  that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view  about the distribution capability of the transaction.  And, you know, we're  very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like  2007.</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools  that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007.   Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance.  None of these  things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're  used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what  degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating  in a transaction.  So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't  comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is  getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite  constructive, and it's something to watch.  It's always a space to watch.   But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I  don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that  running.  A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment  here.  And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded  in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  You raised an important point.  Do you believe sitting  here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the  credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question  like that.  I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if  you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look  historically.  However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran  for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market.  A  lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here.   And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good.  If you look at  earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty  strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>SOLOMON:  And analysts are raising estimates.  Now, we've only seen  kind of half the picture.  We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big  tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph),  energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot  of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset  prices in markets.  You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people  kind of hanging in.  And, you know, we'll have to watch and see.  Do we get  some momentum on the policy side?  Can we get tax reform in some way?  All  that could be constructive.</p><p>So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no  question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment.   If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in  the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I  will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we  look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm  having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the  tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and  there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated  matrix.  But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more  movement in that.  But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's --  that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the  last few months.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  David, so good to see you.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Always good to see you.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Thanks for your time.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Thanks for your time.  (Inaudible).</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Oliver, that's David Solomon.  He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs.  David, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SOLOMON:  Good morning, Erik.  Nice to be here with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SCHATZKER:  Nice to see you again.  We'll begin with the obvious.  I  think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a  rough first quarter.  It's a trading business back on track.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Our trading business is a great franchise.  We work very,  very hard, you know, to serve our clients.  Clearly, we didn't meet  expectations in the first quarter.  You know, although, when you look at  the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities  divisions, all performed in line.  The FICC, you know, FICC did not.  So  look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's  going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest,  tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were  presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good  about our client franchise and our position in the business.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close  look, what conclusions have you drawn?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the  quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given  our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at  the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us.  But look, we  could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount.  And,  you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work  with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have.  We're in  certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the  commodities business, et cetera.</p><p>  And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different  result than others.  But we've got a really terrific franchise.  I  obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings.  But when I  look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our  people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses  are positioned.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Are those positions still losing money?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  There -- there are positions that are losing money.  You --  you kind of pop that right in.  I assume you're referring to the article,  the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg  wrote.  I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that.  This was not a quarter  that was defined by positions losing money.  This was a quarter that was  defined by lower client activity.  And the firm, not maximizing the revenue  opportunity.  But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money,  more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this  discussion.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do  with, say, a risk management problem?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  No, there's absolutely no risk management problem.  That was  not what defined that the quarter at all.  This was a quarter that was  defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one  of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or  levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction.  I think one of  the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed  and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the  election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade,  and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  You know why we're talking about this.  We're talking  about it for two principal reasons.  One is Goldman has a record, a track  record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of  course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade  ...</p><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter.  OK?  It's  not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  But it happened this quarter.  We've got a terrific  franchise.  We feel very good about our franchise.  There's no risk  management issue.  We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're  doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  SOLOMON:  ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  We know.  Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't  meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business.  And, you know,  our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their  clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you  just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend  time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for  your clients over a long period of time, good things happen.  And we feel  very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  FICC is getting all the attention.  But equities wasn't  the star performer it's been in the past either.  Five years ago, Goldman's  equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan  Stanley's is bigger.  What happened?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Yeah.  Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely,  the businesses are weighted in different ways.  We have a leading  institutional equity franchise.  We've got a strong position across  institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage.  But one  of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in  quants.  And there are variety of reasons.  It's a business that's grown  very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that  business.  And that ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  What do you do about it?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in.   But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business.   There's lots of operational risks in that business.  And while we're  investing in it, we want to be in that business.  You know, we -- we're --  we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that  business, but we're building up that capability.  And Morgan Stanley has a  platform of quants that's a little bit larger.  But if you look at the  institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very  significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Can you take some of that market share and quant away from  Morgan Stanley?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that  we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those  clients.  We're focused on that.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  How?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our  offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last  year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive.  Now, we  started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's  something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a  strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error.  I would  say it was a choice that was made.  You know, you only see over time how  all these businesses run.  And look, part of this -- we're not always just  looking for revenue in these businesses.  We're also looking for returns.   OK?  And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance.  And so, you know, I know that  you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error.  You know,  we've run our business.  We have a leading equity franchise.  We're very  focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our  returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set  over a long period of time.</p><p>  We're focused on returns.  We're focused on servicing our clients.   And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different  investments.  But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully  make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may  forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  That was -- that was a once upon a time.  I still watch that  market very closely.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  I'm sure you do.  There is a lot of that capital available  for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose,  would you agree?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance  market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you  know, robust levels.  You know, I think when I look just over the weekend,  we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big  momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market,  obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving  into.  But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a  low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>  And the pricing, you know, very, very tight.  So we're in a relatively  robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of  supply.  And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory  environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been  pressed that significantly.  So ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which  is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged  finance?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Absolutely.  We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk  management culture.  Leveraged finance business, and important business to  service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our  leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had.  We --  we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see  at this point in time.  There actually hasn't been as much of that  activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like  to see.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  So I'm going to do something which you would probably  consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  OK.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  OK.  Charter NEX.  This is a packaging company that  Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the  junior financing.  $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance  sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a  PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds,  you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very,  very wide margin.  But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels  very, very good about our risk management processes around this product.   We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of  the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have  to have a strong risk management culture.  And I'm sure we have a team  that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view  about the distribution capability of the transaction.  And, you know, we're  very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like  2007.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools  that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007.   Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance.  None of these  things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're  used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what  degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating  in a transaction.  So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't  comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>  But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is  getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite  constructive, and it's something to watch.  It's always a space to watch.   But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I  don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that  running.  A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment  here.  And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded  in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  You raised an important point.  Do you believe sitting  here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the  credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question  like that.  I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if  you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look  historically.  However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran  for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market.  A  lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here.   And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good.  If you look at  earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty  strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  And analysts are raising estimates.  Now, we've only seen  kind of half the picture.  We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big  tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph),  energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot  of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset  prices in markets.  You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people  kind of hanging in.  And, you know, we'll have to watch and see.  Do we get  some momentum on the policy side?  Can we get tax reform in some way?  All  that could be constructive.</p><p>  So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no  question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment.   If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in  the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I  will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we  look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm  having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the  tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and  there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated  matrix.  But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more  movement in that.  But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's --  that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the  last few months.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  David, so good to see you.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Always good to see you.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Thanks for your time.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Thanks for your time.  (Inaudible).</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Oliver, that's David Solomon.  He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs. David, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOLOMON: Good morning, Erik. Nice to be here with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCHATZKER: Nice to see you again. We'll begin with the obvious. I think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a rough first quarter. It's a trading business back on track.</p><p>SOLOMON: Our trading business is a great franchise. We work very, very hard, you know, to serve our clients. Clearly, we didn't meet expectations in the first quarter. You know, although, when you look at the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities divisions, all performed in line. The FICC, you know, FICC did not. So look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest, tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good about our client franchise and our position in the business.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close look, what conclusions have you drawn?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us. But look, we could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount. And, you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have. We're in certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the commodities business, et cetera.</p><p>And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different result than others. But we've got a really terrific franchise. I obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings. But when I look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses are positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Are those positions still losing money?</p><p>SOLOMON: There -- there are positions that are losing money. You -- you kind of pop that right in. I assume you're referring to the article, the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg wrote. I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that. This was not a quarter that was defined by positions losing money. This was a quarter that was defined by lower client activity. And the firm, not maximizing the revenue opportunity. But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money, more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do with, say, a risk management problem?</p><p>SOLOMON: No, there's absolutely no risk management problem. That was not what defined that the quarter at all. This was a quarter that was defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction. I think one of the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade, and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER: You know why we're talking about this. We're talking about it for two principal reasons. One is Goldman has a record, a track record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade ...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON: Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter. OK? It's not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER: It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>SOLOMON: But it happened this quarter. We've got a terrific franchise. We feel very good about our franchise. There's no risk management issue. We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOMON: ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER: We know. Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business. And, you know, our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for your clients over a long period of time, good things happen. And we feel very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER: FICC is getting all the attention. But equities wasn't the star performer it's been in the past either. Five years ago, Goldman's equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan Stanley's is bigger. What happened?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah. Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely, the businesses are weighted in different ways. We have a leading institutional equity franchise. We've got a strong position across institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage. But one of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in quants. And there are variety of reasons. It's a business that's grown very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that business. And that ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: What do you do about it?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in. But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business. There's lots of operational risks in that business. And while we're investing in it, we want to be in that business. You know, we -- we're -- we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that business, but we're building up that capability. And Morgan Stanley has a platform of quants that's a little bit larger. But if you look at the institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Can you take some of that market share and quant away from Morgan Stanley?</p><p>SOLOMON: I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those clients. We're focused on that.</p><p>SCHATZKER: How?</p><p>SOLOMON: By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive. Now, we started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>SCHATZKER: At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>SOLOMON: Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error. I would say it was a choice that was made. You know, you only see over time how all these businesses run. And look, part of this -- we're not always just looking for revenue in these businesses. We're also looking for returns. OK? And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance. And so, you know, I know that you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error. You know, we've run our business. We have a leading equity franchise. We're very focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set over a long period of time.</p><p>We're focused on returns. We're focused on servicing our clients. And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different investments. But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>SOLOMON: That was -- that was a once upon a time. I still watch that market very closely.</p><p>SCHATZKER: I'm sure you do. There is a lot of that capital available for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose, would you agree?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you know, robust levels. You know, I think when I look just over the weekend, we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market, obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving into. But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>And the pricing, you know, very, very tight. So we're in a relatively robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of supply. And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been pressed that significantly. So ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged finance?</p><p>SOLOMON: Absolutely. We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk management culture. Leveraged finance business, and important business to service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had. We -- we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see at this point in time. There actually hasn't been as much of that activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like to see.</p><p>SCHATZKER: So I'm going to do something which you would probably consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>SOLOMON: OK.</p><p>SCHATZKER: OK. Charter NEX. This is a packaging company that Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the junior financing. $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>SOLOMON: So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds, you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very, very wide margin. But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels very, very good about our risk management processes around this product. We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have to have a strong risk management culture. And I'm sure we have a team that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view about the distribution capability of the transaction. And, you know, we're very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>SCHATZKER: In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like 2007.</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007. Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance. None of these things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating in a transaction. So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite constructive, and it's something to watch. It's always a space to watch. But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that running. A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment here. And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>SCHATZKER: You raised an important point. Do you believe sitting here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question like that. I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look historically. However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market. A lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here. And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good. If you look at earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>SCHATZKER: And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>SOLOMON: And analysts are raising estimates. Now, we've only seen kind of half the picture. We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph), energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset prices in markets. You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people kind of hanging in. And, you know, we'll have to watch and see. Do we get some momentum on the policy side? Can we get tax reform in some way? All that could be constructive.</p><p>So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment. If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>SOLOMON: You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated matrix. But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more movement in that. But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's -- that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the last few months.</p><p>SCHATZKER: David, so good to see you.</p><p>SOLOMON: Always good to see you.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Thanks for your time.</p><p>SOLOMON: Thanks for your time. (Inaudible).</p><p>SCHATZKER: Oliver, that's David Solomon. He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

OK?  It's  not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  But it happened this quarter.  We've got a terrific  franchise.  We feel very good about our franchise.  There's no risk  management issue.  We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're  doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  SOLOMON:  ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  We know.  Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't  meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business.  And, you know,  our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their  clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you  just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend  time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for  your clients over a long period of time, good things happen.  And we feel  very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  FICC is getting all the attention.  But equities wasn't  the star performer it's been in the past either.  Five years ago, Goldman's  equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan  Stanley's is bigger.  What happened?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Yeah.  Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely,  the businesses are weighted in different ways.  We have a leading  institutional equity franchise.  We've got a strong position across  institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage.  But one  of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in  quants.  And there are variety of reasons.  It's a business that's grown  very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that  business.  And that ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  What do you do about it?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in.   But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business.   There's lots of operational risks in that business.  And while we're  investing in it, we want to be in that business.  You know, we -- we're --  we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that  business, but we're building up that capability.  And Morgan Stanley has a  platform of quants that's a little bit larger.  But if you look at the  institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very  significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Can you take some of that market share and quant away from  Morgan Stanley?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that  we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those  clients.  We're focused on that.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  How?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our  offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last  year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive.  Now, we  started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's  something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a  strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error.  I would  say it was a choice that was made.  You know, you only see over time how  all these businesses run.  And look, part of this -- we're not always just  looking for revenue in these businesses.  We're also looking for returns.   OK?  And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance.  And so, you know, I know that  you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error.  You know,  we've run our business.  We have a leading equity franchise.  We're very  focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our  returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set  over a long period of time.</p><p>  We're focused on returns.  We're focused on servicing our clients.   And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different  investments.  But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully  make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may  forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  That was -- that was a once upon a time.  I still watch that  market very closely.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  I'm sure you do.  There is a lot of that capital available  for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose,  would you agree?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance  market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you  know, robust levels.  You know, I think when I look just over the weekend,  we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big  momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market,  obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving  into.  But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a  low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>  And the pricing, you know, very, very tight.  So we're in a relatively  robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of  supply.  And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory  environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been  pressed that significantly.  So ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which  is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged  finance?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Absolutely.  We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk  management culture.  Leveraged finance business, and important business to  service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our  leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had.  We --  we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see  at this point in time.  There actually hasn't been as much of that  activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like  to see.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  So I'm going to do something which you would probably  consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  OK.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  OK.  Charter NEX.  This is a packaging company that  Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the  junior financing.  $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance  sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a  PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds,  you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very,  very wide margin.  But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels  very, very good about our risk management processes around this product.   We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of  the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have  to have a strong risk management culture.  And I'm sure we have a team  that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view  about the distribution capability of the transaction.  And, you know, we're  very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like  2007.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools  that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007.   Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance.  None of these  things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're  used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what  degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating  in a transaction.  So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't  comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>  But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is  getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite  constructive, and it's something to watch.  It's always a space to watch.   But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I  don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that  running.  A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment  here.  And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded  in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  You raised an important point.  Do you believe sitting  here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the  credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question  like that.  I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if  you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look  historically.  However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran  for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market.  A  lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here.   And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good.  If you look at  earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty  strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  And analysts are raising estimates.  Now, we've only seen  kind of half the picture.  We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big  tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph),  energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot  of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset  prices in markets.  You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people  kind of hanging in.  And, you know, we'll have to watch and see.  Do we get  some momentum on the policy side?  Can we get tax reform in some way?  All  that could be constructive.</p><p>  So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no  question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment.   If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in  the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I  will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we  look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm  having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the  tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and  there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated  matrix.  But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more  movement in that.  But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's --  that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the  last few months.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  David, so good to see you.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Always good to see you.</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Thanks for your time.</p><p>  SOLOMON:  Thanks for your time.  (Inaudible).</p><p>  SCHATZKER:  Oliver, that's David Solomon.  He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs.  David, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOLOMON:  Good morning, Erik.  Nice to be here with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCHATZKER:  Nice to see you again.  We'll begin with the obvious.  I  think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a  rough first quarter.  It's a trading business back on track.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Our trading business is a great franchise.  We work very,  very hard, you know, to serve our clients.  Clearly, we didn't meet  expectations in the first quarter.  You know, although, when you look at  the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities  divisions, all performed in line.  The FICC, you know, FICC did not.  So  look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's  going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest,  tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were  presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good  about our client franchise and our position in the business.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close  look, what conclusions have you drawn?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the  quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given  our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at  the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us.  But look, we  could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount.  And,  you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work  with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have.  We're in  certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the  commodities business, et cetera.</p><p>And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different  result than others.  But we've got a really terrific franchise.  I  obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings.  But when I  look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our  people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses  are positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Are those positions still losing money?</p><p>SOLOMON:  There -- there are positions that are losing money.  You --  you kind of pop that right in.  I assume you're referring to the article,  the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg  wrote.  I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that.  This was not a quarter  that was defined by positions losing money.  This was a quarter that was  defined by lower client activity.  And the firm, not maximizing the revenue  opportunity.  But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money,  more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this  discussion.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do  with, say, a risk management problem?</p><p>SOLOMON:  No, there's absolutely no risk management problem.  That was  not what defined that the quarter at all.  This was a quarter that was  defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one  of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or  levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction.  I think one of  the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed  and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the  election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade,  and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  You know why we're talking about this.  We're talking  about it for two principal reasons.  One is Goldman has a record, a track  record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of  course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade  ...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON:  Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter.  OK?  It's  not the first quarter we didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER:  It doesn't happen very often.</p><p>SOLOMON:  But it happened this quarter.  We've got a terrific  franchise.  We feel very good about our franchise.  There's no risk  management issue.  We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're  doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOLOMON:  ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  We know.  Do you do anything differently going forward?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't  meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business.  And, you know,  our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their  clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you  just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend  time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for  your clients over a long period of time, good things happen.  And we feel  very good about the way we're positioned.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  FICC is getting all the attention.  But equities wasn't  the star performer it's been in the past either.  Five years ago, Goldman's  equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan  Stanley's is bigger.  What happened?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Yeah.  Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely,  the businesses are weighted in different ways.  We have a leading  institutional equity franchise.  We've got a strong position across  institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage.  But one  of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in  quants.  And there are variety of reasons.  It's a business that's grown  very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that  business.  And that ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  What do you do about it?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in.   But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business.   There's lots of operational risks in that business.  And while we're  investing in it, we want to be in that business.  You know, we -- we're --  we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that  business, but we're building up that capability.  And Morgan Stanley has a  platform of quants that's a little bit larger.  But if you look at the  institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very  significant institutional leading equity franchise.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Can you take some of that market share and quant away from  Morgan Stanley?</p><p>SOLOMON:  I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that  we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those  clients.  We're focused on that.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  How?</p><p>SOLOMON:  By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our  offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last  year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive.  Now, we  started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's  something we're going to continue to focus on.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a  strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error.  I would  say it was a choice that was made.  You know, you only see over time how  all these businesses run.  And look, part of this -- we're not always just  looking for revenue in these businesses.  We're also looking for returns.   OK?  And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance.  And so, you know, I know that  you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error.  You know,  we've run our business.  We have a leading equity franchise.  We're very  focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our  returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set  over a long period of time.</p><p>We're focused on returns.  We're focused on servicing our clients.   And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different  investments.  But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully  make the right long-term decisions.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may  forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.</p><p>SOLOMON:  That was -- that was a once upon a time.  I still watch that  market very closely.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  I'm sure you do.  There is a lot of that capital available  for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose,  would you agree?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance  market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you  know, robust levels.  You know, I think when I look just over the weekend,  we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big  momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market,  obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving  into.  But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a  low base last year but up significantly.</p><p>And the pricing, you know, very, very tight.  So we're in a relatively  robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of  supply.  And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory  environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been  pressed that significantly.  So ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which  is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged  finance?</p><p>SOLOMON:  Absolutely.  We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk  management culture.  Leveraged finance business, and important business to  service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our  leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had.  We --  we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see  at this point in time.  There actually hasn't been as much of that  activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like  to see.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  So I'm going to do something which you would probably  consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.</p><p>SOLOMON:  OK.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  OK.  Charter NEX.  This is a packaging company that  Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the  junior financing.  $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance  sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a  PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.</p><p>SOLOMON:  So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds,  you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very,  very wide margin.  But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels  very, very good about our risk management processes around this product.   We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of  the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have  to have a strong risk management culture.  And I'm sure we have a team  that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view  about the distribution capability of the transaction.  And, you know, we're  very disciplined in the way we underwrite.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like  2007.</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools  that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007.   Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance.  None of these  things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're  used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what  degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating  in a transaction.  So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't  comment on the specific transaction.</p><p>But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is  getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite  constructive, and it's something to watch.  It's always a space to watch.   But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I  don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that  running.  A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment  here.  And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded  in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...</p><p>SCHATZKER:  You raised an important point.  Do you believe sitting  here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the  credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question  like that.  I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if  you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look  historically.  However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran  for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market.  A  lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here.   And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good.  If you look at  earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty  strong corporate earnings environment.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  And analysts are raising estimates.</p><p>SOLOMON:  And analysts are raising estimates.  Now, we've only seen  kind of half the picture.  We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big  tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph),  energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot  of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset  prices in markets.  You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people  kind of hanging in.  And, you know, we'll have to watch and see.  Do we get  some momentum on the policy side?  Can we get tax reform in some way?  All  that could be constructive.</p><p>So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no  question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment.   If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in  the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I  will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we  look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm  having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the  tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.</p><p>SOLOMON:  You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and  there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated  matrix.  But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more  movement in that.  But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's --  that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the  last few months.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  David, so good to see you.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Always good to see you.</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Thanks for your time.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Thanks for your time.  (Inaudible).</p><p>SCHATZKER:  Oliver, that's David Solomon.  He's the co-president of  Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Yeah, you're right, it's quite a list. Welcome, Gregg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LEMKAU: Thank you.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So, 2016 was a good year, not quite up to the standards of say 2015. We had obviously big global deals, buyer in Monsanto, A.T., Time Warner, et cetera. What do you looking at 2017? What is your crystal ball say?</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, I think the outlook for M&amp;A in 2017 is quite strong. A lot of the factors that existed in 2015 and '16 that drive activity continue to persist. So you have low interest rates. You got abundantly available capital. You've got limited growth opportunities for corporate organically. And you have positive equity markets.</p><p>So that's all still in place. I think more importantly, some of the headwinds we saw in 2016, it's slowdown activity, are started this upside. And I think specifically, the regulatory environment. I think the expectation is we'll have a little bit of an easier regulatory ..</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Thanks again, Vonnie. I appreciate it. Sorry about that, Gregg.</p><p>LEMKAU: Sure.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: And I want to talk, so we wanted to give him an opportunity.</p><p>LEMKAU: Good idea.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: As you were saying, you expect easier regulatory environment in 2017.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. I think the expectation 2017 will be a bit of a loose for regulatory environment. And when you combine that with what we expect to be corporate tax reform, and in particular cash repatriation. It's actually a general sense of optimism in the business community, in particular, in corporate America that seems to be driving the desire to go out and be much more proactive on the strategic front.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So how does repatriation? Is that something that's talk a lot about by, a lot by the M&amp;A bankers in the M&amp;A words? How do you think that might impact M&amp;A? Because so many deals we've seen, you know, J&amp;J right now talking to Kellyanne, a lot of these companies with offshore cast have used that to do deals in Europe, what happens if they bring that cash back to United States?</p><p>LEMKAU: So there something between $1 trillion to $2 trillion of cash trapped offshore by U.S. companies, and now the expectation will be able to bring that back in a relatively low tax rate and deployed in the U.S., so under deployed in a form of capital expenditures or in the form of M&amp;A.</p><p>You've seen companies do lots of acquisitions outside the U.S. using that cash, but there a lot more targets in the U.S. and I think companies with the ability to deploy that capital in the U.S. whether it's a trillion or $2 trillion, and the cash that continue to generate back in the U.S., you'll see a big pick up in activity domestically.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Yeah. And what are the industries that have the most offshore cash, is it tech for the most product?</p><p>LEMKAU: It's really the biggest the company. So it's mostly tech in big pharma but it's Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, J&amp;J. You saw a lot of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to do things to be able to access that cash offshore via M&amp;A. If they can just bring that back and use it and deploy it via M&amp;A in the U.S. they'll be able to do that much more easily.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So they can bring it back, they'll use it for dividens. They'll use it for probably share the purchases, and then use for M&amp;A is the anticipation if you will.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: OK. Will biotech and technology companies have a lot of cash as you were --</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. It's really the big pharma companies with the big pharma companies as they look to grow, they probably going to deploy against biotech where the real fuel and the ability to drag the top line.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Do you expect other certain trends that emerge in a given year? You know, when -- in 2016, you look back in a couple of years, you say that was the year of X or in 2008-2009, that was a certain, you know, era. What would you expect the trends might be in 2017?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. I think the big wave in 2017 partly fueled some of these cash repatriations, is going to be a significant amount of transaction across technology, media and telecom. You've seen the conversion happen in that sector, it was pretty remarkable. You've seen big transaction where Comcast bought NBC, Time Warner and AT&amp;T trying to come together, even Verizon and Yahoo to an extent.</p><p>But the big distribution companies, looking to buy content, and the desire for this big media companies and big technology companies to get access to content and to get closer, to get some risk critical. And if you look -- you look at the Golden Globe last night, you had 17 nominations for shows or movies that was produced by Netflix or Amazon. I mean, imagine uttering that sentence five years ago.</p><p>And so, these companies acknowledging media and telecom, all of these are in content, all of these are in to get closer to consumer. I think needing to do that a lot via M&amp;A.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: What's interesting is Amazon and Google, and even Apple have lots of cash. You know, everyday they're building our money, but they haven't done a lot of big deals. Do you expect that changes at some point? That they acquire, you know, acquire the arrivals or acquire entertainment companies.</p><p>LEMKAU: You see, that's the great question. I think these companies, you know, the five biggest market cap companies in the world are all with these big tech companies. They all happen to have big cash balances, sitting offshore, able to be brought back. And they've been really under penetrated in M&amp;A.</p><p>So the real question is, when they will go pursue that as their top line growth starts to slow, which started. It's a natural time to do it. As the industry starts to converge is a natural time to do it. And the real question that really comes down to this regulatory piece, will the regulators allows them to do that, not just from the anti-trust standpoint but over our regulation where there's the FCC or the E.C. or the DOJ, of the FTC, will allow these big companies to get bigger via M&amp;A.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Is it the Goldman expectation, your expectation that the Trump administration be more like the Bush administration when it comes to anti- trust?</p><p>LEMKAU: I think it will be. You know, it's interesting a lot will remain to be seen. I think the hope is that we'll be a little bit looser. I'd say the Obama administration in the past year in particular, that a lot more stringent around M&amp;A. There were $500 billion of transactions last year that fell way, largely due to anti-trust or interpretation of tax law. But if you look at Pfizer now or Baker Hughes and Halliburton, stay up for people (ph).</p><p>A lot of big deals fell away and the Obama administration kind of heading into their last year, got a lot more aggressive. I think the views that eases up to a degree and whether it returns all the way to that -- was under the Bush administration, that will get to be seen.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Did you see situations where companies considered doing a deal. But, you know what, that will probably get a block here in this administration, let's read for that in a year.</p><p>LEMKAU: I think people that a lot of more anxious really as we head into 2016, and you saw some of these deals fall away. The last thing a board or a CEO wants to do is announce a big strategic transaction and how they can held up by the regulators for a long period of time. And then, ultimately, not happen.</p><p>It paralyzes a company. It's not great for the board. It's not great for the target or the buyer. And if somebody's transaction, we're getting stop, people really back to it in the table. I think if they see a looser regulatory environment, that much, more likely get back to the table.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So Trump is going to have, he is in that real situation where he's going to have the House and the Senate, you know, but his party if you will. So as there, we're going to see big tax moves not just on repatriation but overall a big tax cut that might impact corporate taxes. How do you think that impacts M&amp;A overall? What's that going to do to a company that's looking to do a deal?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah. I'd say, corporate tax cuts should also be a fuel to M&amp;A. I think you'll see companies that have none core assets. It will be a lot easier to sell them if there's a reduce tax rate, and then having to have tax so we could just selling an asset. You'll see probably more divestitures than spin offs. I think people have been trying to do thing via tax, been off recently.</p><p>The one caveat to all of that is you may see a bit of a pause for awhile until it becomes clear what the tax rate is going to be. So you're going to sell an asset and you don't know if it's going to earn after tax at 35 percent or 25 percent or 15 percent. You probably want to wait to see what that new tax laws going to be but there's meaningful value, apparition around the actual earnings power of what you're selling.</p><p>So you could actually see a bit of a log until there's clarity around the tax report, and then a significant pick up and activity.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: All right. We're going to ask more questions for you. We throw that first back to Vonnie.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Thanks again, Vonnie.</p><p>So as Vonnie said, oil and gas could be busy this year. It was pretty slow in 2015-2016, maybe because a barrel of oil went from 100 something a barrel to as low as like $25 a barrel, I'm sure that had a big impact. What's your view or what oil and gas is going to do in 2017?</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, I mean, look at where the big energy companies, the oil and gas companies in particular, spent their time in focus in the past two years. It was really fixing their balance sheets and fixing their cost structures for dramatically reduce oil price. I had to figure out how to survive.</p><p>Lots of that self help is behind him, and you've got recovering oil price and you've got this general sense of optimism in the market that is likely to have all of them a lot more proactive around strategic activities. So I think you'll see a meaningful pick up in activity in the oil and gas piece, especially relative to what we saw in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: What kind of impact does it have for a company when, you know, your core commodity, if the price of that is dropping so dramatically, you know, as I said, went from 100 I think in 2014 to below 30 in 2016. I mean, that just can't help a company who is thinking of putting himself on a block or considering expending billions to buy somebody.</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, it's fascinating. I think the companies that are in survival mode, need to really fix that capital structure. And most of them were built with CapEx budgets that didn't support $50 or that was more like $100 oil, so had a dramatically reshape that. I think the biggest companies who were positioned for the sustained downturn, weren't like they go and fix something off in the bottom because they want to make sure it was going to survive. They might rather see it go through bankruptcy and pick up the pieces.</p><p>I think a lot of the companies have now gotten through that, but the bottom has been hit and we start to recover and I think the biggest companies will feel a lot better about consolidating. And I think the smaller companies will fell like they not getting to a point where they can realize the value of doing an M&amp;A transaction.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: It makes sense. It makes sense.</p><p>I want to circle back on something we're talking about earlier, which is M&amp;A trust environment.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: And how -- there's a lot of things that would make a banker or a lawyer feel optimistic. What are some of the things that could be a concern in the M&amp;A trust world? Because obviously, Donald Trump has been really fixated on jobs and maybe that starts to play into and could dampen some M&amp;A this year.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah, I think that's right. I think a lot in the world is going to wait and see because you have a sense for how the new administration might behave in a pro business way but not exactly how they going to behave on any specific transaction or on transactions probably define. Lots of this consolidating transactions over the past year, who have been focus within the cost, which largely means taking that jobs. I think that's not going to be a sound bite or not going to be a narrative, this going to be particularly appealing in this administration.</p><p>I think the company is going to focus on doing big M&amp;A transactions in particular, and the U.S. should be focus on, you know, creating a U.S. champion, or creating a winner in the U.S., of a global industry. And then, they go about doing an M&amp;A transaction to create and focusing on growth and not focusing on cost cutting.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Are there particular industries where jobs are more likely to be part of the equation in a big deal like industrial companies or oil and gas even?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah. I think the big consolidating transactions that have largely work have been industrial consolidation. We've actually seen it in consumer consolidation, the ability for these companies to come together and take out cost. Whether it's in a form of jobs, of sales people or R&amp;D, have actually quite effective in driving the bottom line.</p><p>Again, but not necessarily feeding into the sentiment of where the countries going right now, which is going to be by creating jobs, is how I think they need reposition themselves around trying to put companies together in accelerated top line as opposed to just take out cost.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: I got it. Thanks, Gregg, good to have you.</p><p>LEMKAU: Thanks, Jeff.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Back to you, Vonnie.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Yeah, you're right, it's quite a list.   Welcome, Gregg. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LEMKAU:  Thank you. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  So, 2016 was a good year, not quite up to the standards of say  2015.  We had obviously big global deals, buyer in Monsanto, A.T., Time  Warner, et cetera.  What do you looking at 2017?  What is your crystal ball  say? </p><p>LEMKAU:  Well, I think the outlook for M&amp;A in 2017 is quite strong.  A lot  of the factors that existed in 2015 and '16 that drive activity continue to  persist.  So you have low interest rates.  You got abundantly available  capital.  You've got limited growth opportunities for corporate  organically.  And you have positive equity markets. </p><p>So that's all still in place.  I think more importantly, some of the  headwinds we saw in 2016, it's slowdown activity, are started this upside.   And I think specifically, the regulatory environment.  I think the  expectation is we'll have a little bit of an easier regulatory .. </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Thanks again, Vonnie.  I appreciate it.  Sorry about that,  Gregg. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Sure. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  And I want to talk, so we wanted to give him an opportunity. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Good idea. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  As you were saying, you expect easier regulatory environment in  2017. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yes.  I think the expectation 2017 will be a bit of a loose for  regulatory environment.  And when you combine that with what we expect to  be corporate tax reform, and in particular cash repatriation.  It's  actually a general sense of optimism in the business community, in  particular, in corporate America that seems to be driving the desire to go  out and be much more proactive on the strategic front. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  So how does repatriation?  Is that something that's talk a lot  about by, a lot by the M&amp;A bankers in the M&amp;A words?  How do you think that  might impact M&amp;A?  Because so many deals we've seen, you know, J&amp;J right  now talking to Kellyanne, a lot of these companies with offshore cast have  used that to do deals in Europe, what happens if they bring that cash back  to United States? </p><p>LEMKAU:  So there something between $1 trillion to $2 trillion of cash  trapped offshore by U.S. companies, and now the expectation will be able to  bring that back in a relatively low tax rate and deployed in the U.S., so  under deployed in a form of capital expenditures or in the form of M&amp;A. </p><p>You've seen companies do lots of acquisitions outside the U.S. using that  cash, but there a lot more targets in the U.S. and I think companies with  the ability to deploy that capital in the U.S. whether it's a trillion or  $2 trillion, and the cash that continue to generate back in the U.S.,  you'll see a big pick up in activity domestically. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Yeah.  And what are the industries that have the most offshore  cash, is it tech for the most product? </p><p>LEMKAU:  It's really the biggest the company.  So it's mostly tech in big  pharma but it's Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, J&amp;J.  You saw a lot of  companies in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to do things to be able to  access that cash offshore via M&amp;A.  If they can just bring that back and  use it and deploy it via M&amp;A in the U.S. they'll be able to do that much  more easily. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  So they can bring it back, they'll use it for dividens.   They'll use it for probably share the purchases, and then use for M&amp;A is  the anticipation if you will. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yes. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  OK.  Will biotech and technology companies have a lot of cash  as you were -- </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yes.  It's really the big pharma companies with the big pharma  companies as they look to grow, they probably going to deploy against  biotech where the real fuel and the ability to drag the top line. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Do you expect other certain trends that emerge in a given year?   You know, when -- in 2016, you look back in a couple of years, you say that  was the year of X or in 2008-2009, that was a certain, you know, era.  What  would you expect the trends might be in 2017? </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yes.  I think the big wave in 2017 partly fueled some of these  cash repatriations, is going to be a significant amount of transaction  across technology, media and telecom.  You've seen the conversion happen in  that sector, it was pretty remarkable.  You've seen big transaction where  Comcast bought NBC, Time Warner and AT&amp;T trying to come together, even  Verizon and Yahoo to an extent. </p><p>But the big distribution companies, looking to buy content, and the desire  for this big media companies and big technology companies to get access to  content and to get closer, to get some risk critical.  And if you look --  you look at the Golden Globe last night, you had 17 nominations for shows  or movies that was produced by Netflix or Amazon.  I mean, imagine uttering  that sentence five years ago. </p><p>And so, these companies acknowledging media and telecom, all of these are  in content, all of these are in to get closer to consumer.  I think needing  to do that a lot via M&amp;A. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  What's interesting is Amazon and Google, and even Apple have  lots of cash.  You know, everyday they're building our money, but they  haven't done a lot of big deals.  Do you expect that changes at some point?   That they acquire, you know, acquire the arrivals or acquire entertainment  companies. </p><p>LEMKAU:  You see, that's the great question.  I think these companies, you  know, the five biggest market cap companies in the world are all with these  big tech companies.  They all happen to have big cash balances, sitting  offshore, able to be brought back.  And they've been really under  penetrated in M&amp;A. </p><p>So the real question is, when they will go pursue that as their top line  growth starts to slow, which started.  It's a natural time to do it.  As  the industry starts to converge is a natural time to do it.  And the real  question that really comes down to this regulatory piece, will the  regulators allows them to do that, not just from the anti-trust standpoint  but over our regulation where there's the FCC or the E.C. or the DOJ, of  the FTC, will allow these big companies to get bigger via M&amp;A. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Is it the Goldman expectation, your expectation that the Trump  administration be more like the Bush administration when it comes to anti- trust? </p><p>LEMKAU:  I think it will be.  You know, it's interesting a lot will remain  to be seen.  I think the hope is that we'll be a little bit looser.  I'd  say the Obama administration in the past year in particular, that a lot  more stringent around M&amp;A.  There were $500 billion of transactions last  year that fell way, largely due to anti-trust or interpretation of tax law.   But if you look at Pfizer now or Baker Hughes and Halliburton, stay up for  people (ph). </p><p>A lot of big deals fell away and the Obama administration kind of heading  into their last year, got a lot more aggressive.  I think the views that  eases up to a degree and whether it returns all the way to that -- was  under the Bush administration, that will get to be seen. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Did you see situations where companies considered doing a deal.   But, you know what, that will probably get a block here in this  administration, let's read for that in a year. </p><p>LEMKAU:  I think people that a lot of more anxious really as we head into  2016, and you saw some of these deals fall away.  The last thing a board or  a CEO wants to do is announce a big strategic transaction and how they can  held up by the regulators for a long period of time.  And then, ultimately,  not happen. </p><p>It paralyzes a company.  It's not great for the board.  It's not great for  the target or the buyer.  And if somebody's transaction, we're getting  stop, people really back to it in the table.  I think if they see a looser  regulatory environment, that much, more likely get back to the table. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  So Trump is going to have, he is in that real situation where  he's going to have the House and the Senate, you know, but his party if you  will.  So as there, we're going to see big tax moves not just on  repatriation but overall a big tax cut that might impact corporate taxes.   How do you think that impacts M&amp;A overall?  What's that going to do to a  company that's looking to do a deal? </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yeah.  I'd say, corporate tax cuts should also be a fuel to M&amp;A.   I think you'll see companies that have none core assets.  It will be a lot  easier to sell them if there's a reduce tax rate, and then having to have  tax so we could just selling an asset.  You'll see probably more  divestitures than spin offs.  I think people have been trying to do thing  via tax, been off recently. </p><p>The one caveat to all of that is you may see a bit of a pause for awhile  until it becomes clear what the tax rate is going to be.  So you're going  to sell an asset and you don't know if it's going to earn after tax at 35  percent or 25 percent or 15 percent.  You probably want to wait to see what  that new tax laws going to be but there's meaningful value, apparition  around the actual earnings power of what you're selling. </p><p>So you could actually see a bit of a log until there's clarity around the  tax report, and then a significant pick up and activity. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  All right.  We're going to ask more questions for you.  We  throw that first back to Vonnie. </p><p>(BREAK) </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Thanks again, Vonnie. </p><p>So as Vonnie said, oil and gas could be busy this year.  It was pretty slow  in 2015-2016, maybe because a barrel of oil went from 100 something a  barrel to as low as like $25 a barrel, I'm sure that had a big impact.   What's your view or what oil and gas is going to do in 2017? </p><p>LEMKAU:  Well, I mean, look at where the big energy companies, the oil and  gas companies in particular, spent their time in focus in the past two  years.  It was really fixing their balance sheets and fixing their cost  structures for dramatically reduce oil price.  I had to figure out how to  survive. </p><p>Lots of that self help is behind him, and you've got recovering oil price  and you've got this general sense of optimism in the market that is likely  to have all of them a lot more proactive around strategic activities.  So I  think you'll see a meaningful pick up in activity in the oil and gas piece,  especially relative to what we saw in 2015 and 2016. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  What kind of impact does it have for a company when, you know,  your core commodity, if the price of that is dropping so dramatically, you  know, as I said, went from 100 I think in 2014 to below 30 in 2016.  I  mean, that just can't help a company who is thinking of putting himself on  a block or considering expending billions to buy somebody. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Well, it's fascinating.  I think the companies that are in  survival mode, need to really fix that capital structure.  And most of them  were built with CapEx budgets that didn't support $50 or that was more like  $100 oil, so had a dramatically reshape that.  I think the biggest  companies who were positioned for the sustained downturn, weren't like they  go and fix something off in the bottom because they want to make sure it  was going to survive.  They might rather see it go through bankruptcy and  pick up the pieces. </p><p>I think a lot of the companies have now gotten through that, but the bottom  has been hit and we start to recover and I think the biggest companies will  feel a lot better about consolidating.  And I think the smaller companies  will fell like they not getting to a point where they can realize the value  of doing an M&amp;A transaction. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  It makes sense.  It makes sense. </p><p>I want to circle back on something we're talking about earlier, which is  M&amp;A trust environment. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yes. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  And how -- there's a lot of things that would make a banker or  a lawyer feel optimistic.  What are some of the things that could be a  concern in the M&amp;A trust world?  Because obviously, Donald Trump has been  really fixated on jobs and maybe that starts to play into and could dampen  some M&amp;A this year. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yeah, I think that's right.  I think a lot in the world is going  to wait and see because you have a sense for how the new administration  might behave in a pro business way but not exactly how they going to behave  on any specific transaction or on transactions probably define.  Lots of  this consolidating transactions over the past year, who have been focus  within the cost, which largely means taking that jobs.  I think that's not  going to be a sound bite or not going to be a narrative, this going to be  particularly appealing in this administration. </p><p>I think the company is going to focus on doing big M&amp;A transactions in  particular, and the U.S. should be focus on, you know, creating a U.S.  champion, or creating a winner in the U.S., of a global industry.  And  then, they go about doing an M&amp;A transaction to create and focusing on  growth and not focusing on cost cutting. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Are there particular industries where jobs are more likely to  be part of the equation in a big deal like industrial companies or oil and  gas even? </p><p>LEMKAU:  Yeah.  I think the big consolidating transactions that have  largely work have been industrial consolidation.  We've actually seen it in  consumer consolidation, the ability for these companies to come together  and take out cost.  Whether it's in a form of jobs, of sales people or R&amp;D,  have actually quite effective in driving the bottom line. </p><p>Again, but not necessarily feeding into the sentiment of where the  countries going right now, which is going to be by creating jobs, is how I  think they need reposition themselves around trying to put companies  together in accelerated top line as opposed to just take out cost. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  I got it.  Thanks, Gregg, good to have you. </p><p>LEMKAU:  Thanks, Jeff. </p><p>MCCRACKEN:  Back to you, Vonnie. </p><p>[*]  END ***END OF TRANSCRIPT*** </p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Yeah, you're right, it's quite a list.   Welcome, Gregg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> LEMKAU:  Thank you.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  So, 2016 was a good year, not quite up to the standards of say  2015.  We had obviously big global deals, buyer in Monsanto, A.T., Time  Warner, et cetera.  What do you looking at 2017?  What is your crystal ball  say?</p><p> LEMKAU:  Well, I think the outlook for M&amp;A in 2017 is quite strong.  A lot  of the factors that existed in 2015 and '16 that drive activity continue to  persist.  So you have low interest rates.  You got abundantly available  capital.  You've got limited growth opportunities for corporate  organically.  And you have positive equity markets.</p><p> So that's all still in place.  I think more importantly, some of the  headwinds we saw in 2016, it's slowdown activity, are started this upside.   And I think specifically, the regulatory environment.  I think the  expectation is we'll have a little bit of an easier regulatory ..</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Thanks again, Vonnie.  I appreciate it.  Sorry about that,  Gregg.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Sure.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  And I want to talk, so we wanted to give him an opportunity.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Good idea.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  As you were saying, you expect easier regulatory environment in  2017.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yes.  I think the expectation 2017 will be a bit of a loose for  regulatory environment.  And when you combine that with what we expect to  be corporate tax reform, and in particular cash repatriation.  It's  actually a general sense of optimism in the business community, in  particular, in corporate America that seems to be driving the desire to go  out and be much more proactive on the strategic front.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  So how does repatriation?  Is that something that's talk a lot  about by, a lot by the M&amp;A bankers in the M&amp;A words?  How do you think that  might impact M&amp;A?  Because so many deals we've seen, you know, J&amp;J right  now talking to Kellyanne, a lot of these companies with offshore cast have  used that to do deals in Europe, what happens if they bring that cash back  to United States?</p><p> LEMKAU:  So there something between $1 trillion to $2 trillion of cash  trapped offshore by U.S. companies, and now the expectation will be able to  bring that back in a relatively low tax rate and deployed in the U.S., so  under deployed in a form of capital expenditures or in the form of M&amp;A.</p><p> You've seen companies do lots of acquisitions outside the U.S. using that  cash, but there a lot more targets in the U.S. and I think companies with  the ability to deploy that capital in the U.S. whether it's a trillion or  $2 trillion, and the cash that continue to generate back in the U.S.,  you'll see a big pick up in activity domestically.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Yeah.  And what are the industries that have the most offshore  cash, is it tech for the most product?</p><p> LEMKAU:  It's really the biggest the company.  So it's mostly tech in big  pharma but it's Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, J&amp;J.  You saw a lot of  companies in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to do things to be able to  access that cash offshore via M&amp;A.  If they can just bring that back and  use it and deploy it via M&amp;A in the U.S. they'll be able to do that much  more easily.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  So they can bring it back, they'll use it for dividens.   They'll use it for probably share the purchases, and then use for M&amp;A is  the anticipation if you will.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yes.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  OK.  Will biotech and technology companies have a lot of cash  as you were --</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yes.  It's really the big pharma companies with the big pharma  companies as they look to grow, they probably going to deploy against  biotech where the real fuel and the ability to drag the top line.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Do you expect other certain trends that emerge in a given year?   You know, when -- in 2016, you look back in a couple of years, you say that  was the year of X or in 2008-2009, that was a certain, you know, era.  What  would you expect the trends might be in 2017?</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yes.  I think the big wave in 2017 partly fueled some of these  cash repatriations, is going to be a significant amount of transaction  across technology, media and telecom.  You've seen the conversion happen in  that sector, it was pretty remarkable.  You've seen big transaction where  Comcast bought NBC, Time Warner and AT&amp;T trying to come together, even  Verizon and Yahoo to an extent.</p><p> But the big distribution companies, looking to buy content, and the desire  for this big media companies and big technology companies to get access to  content and to get closer, to get some risk critical.  And if you look --  you look at the Golden Globe last night, you had 17 nominations for shows  or movies that was produced by Netflix or Amazon.  I mean, imagine uttering  that sentence five years ago.</p><p> And so, these companies acknowledging media and telecom, all of these are  in content, all of these are in to get closer to consumer.  I think needing  to do that a lot via M&amp;A.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  What's interesting is Amazon and Google, and even Apple have  lots of cash.  You know, everyday they're building our money, but they  haven't done a lot of big deals.  Do you expect that changes at some point?   That they acquire, you know, acquire the arrivals or acquire entertainment  companies.</p><p> LEMKAU:  You see, that's the great question.  I think these companies, you  know, the five biggest market cap companies in the world are all with these  big tech companies.  They all happen to have big cash balances, sitting  offshore, able to be brought back.  And they've been really under  penetrated in M&amp;A.</p><p> So the real question is, when they will go pursue that as their top line  growth starts to slow, which started.  It's a natural time to do it.  As  the industry starts to converge is a natural time to do it.  And the real  question that really comes down to this regulatory piece, will the  regulators allows them to do that, not just from the anti-trust standpoint  but over our regulation where there's the FCC or the E.C. or the DOJ, of  the FTC, will allow these big companies to get bigger via M&amp;A.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Is it the Goldman expectation, your expectation that the Trump  administration be more like the Bush administration when it comes to anti- trust?</p><p> LEMKAU:  I think it will be.  You know, it's interesting a lot will remain  to be seen.  I think the hope is that we'll be a little bit looser.  I'd  say the Obama administration in the past year in particular, that a lot  more stringent around M&amp;A.  There were $500 billion of transactions last  year that fell way, largely due to anti-trust or interpretation of tax law.   But if you look at Pfizer now or Baker Hughes and Halliburton, stay up for  people (ph).</p><p> A lot of big deals fell away and the Obama administration kind of heading  into their last year, got a lot more aggressive.  I think the views that  eases up to a degree and whether it returns all the way to that -- was  under the Bush administration, that will get to be seen.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Did you see situations where companies considered doing a deal.   But, you know what, that will probably get a block here in this  administration, let's read for that in a year.</p><p> LEMKAU:  I think people that a lot of more anxious really as we head into  2016, and you saw some of these deals fall away.  The last thing a board or  a CEO wants to do is announce a big strategic transaction and how they can  held up by the regulators for a long period of time.  And then, ultimately,  not happen.</p><p> It paralyzes a company.  It's not great for the board.  It's not great for  the target or the buyer.  And if somebody's transaction, we're getting  stop, people really back to it in the table.  I think if they see a looser  regulatory environment, that much, more likely get back to the table.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  So Trump is going to have, he is in that real situation where  he's going to have the House and the Senate, you know, but his party if you  will.  So as there, we're going to see big tax moves not just on  repatriation but overall a big tax cut that might impact corporate taxes.   How do you think that impacts M&amp;A overall?  What's that going to do to a  company that's looking to do a deal?</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yeah.  I'd say, corporate tax cuts should also be a fuel to M&amp;A.   I think you'll see companies that have none core assets.  It will be a lot  easier to sell them if there's a reduce tax rate, and then having to have  tax so we could just selling an asset.  You'll see probably more  divestitures than spin offs.  I think people have been trying to do thing  via tax, been off recently.</p><p> The one caveat to all of that is you may see a bit of a pause for awhile  until it becomes clear what the tax rate is going to be.  So you're going  to sell an asset and you don't know if it's going to earn after tax at 35  percent or 25 percent or 15 percent.  You probably want to wait to see what  that new tax laws going to be but there's meaningful value, apparition  around the actual earnings power of what you're selling.</p><p> So you could actually see a bit of a log until there's clarity around the  tax report, and then a significant pick up and activity.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  All right.  We're going to ask more questions for you.  We  throw that first back to Vonnie.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Thanks again, Vonnie.</p><p> So as Vonnie said, oil and gas could be busy this year.  It was pretty slow  in 2015-2016, maybe because a barrel of oil went from 100 something a  barrel to as low as like $25 a barrel, I'm sure that had a big impact.   What's your view or what oil and gas is going to do in 2017?</p><p> LEMKAU:  Well, I mean, look at where the big energy companies, the oil and  gas companies in particular, spent their time in focus in the past two  years.  It was really fixing their balance sheets and fixing their cost  structures for dramatically reduce oil price.  I had to figure out how to  survive.</p><p> Lots of that self help is behind him, and you've got recovering oil price  and you've got this general sense of optimism in the market that is likely  to have all of them a lot more proactive around strategic activities.  So I  think you'll see a meaningful pick up in activity in the oil and gas piece,  especially relative to what we saw in 2015 and 2016.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  What kind of impact does it have for a company when, you know,  your core commodity, if the price of that is dropping so dramatically, you  know, as I said, went from 100 I think in 2014 to below 30 in 2016.  I  mean, that just can't help a company who is thinking of putting himself on  a block or considering expending billions to buy somebody.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Well, it's fascinating.  I think the companies that are in  survival mode, need to really fix that capital structure.  And most of them  were built with CapEx budgets that didn't support $50 or that was more like  $100 oil, so had a dramatically reshape that.  I think the biggest  companies who were positioned for the sustained downturn, weren't like they  go and fix something off in the bottom because they want to make sure it  was going to survive.  They might rather see it go through bankruptcy and  pick up the pieces.</p><p> I think a lot of the companies have now gotten through that, but the bottom  has been hit and we start to recover and I think the biggest companies will  feel a lot better about consolidating.  And I think the smaller companies  will fell like they not getting to a point where they can realize the value  of doing an M&amp;A transaction.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  It makes sense.  It makes sense.</p><p> I want to circle back on something we're talking about earlier, which is  M&amp;A trust environment.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yes.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  And how -- there's a lot of things that would make a banker or  a lawyer feel optimistic.  What are some of the things that could be a  concern in the M&amp;A trust world?  Because obviously, Donald Trump has been  really fixated on jobs and maybe that starts to play into and could dampen  some M&amp;A this year.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yeah, I think that's right.  I think a lot in the world is going  to wait and see because you have a sense for how the new administration  might behave in a pro business way but not exactly how they going to behave  on any specific transaction or on transactions probably define.  Lots of  this consolidating transactions over the past year, who have been focus  within the cost, which largely means taking that jobs.  I think that's not  going to be a sound bite or not going to be a narrative, this going to be  particularly appealing in this administration.</p><p> I think the company is going to focus on doing big M&amp;A transactions in  particular, and the U.S. should be focus on, you know, creating a U.S.  champion, or creating a winner in the U.S., of a global industry.  And  then, they go about doing an M&amp;A transaction to create and focusing on  growth and not focusing on cost cutting.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Are there particular industries where jobs are more likely to  be part of the equation in a big deal like industrial companies or oil and  gas even?</p><p> LEMKAU:  Yeah.  I think the big consolidating transactions that have  largely work have been industrial consolidation.  We've actually seen it in  consumer consolidation, the ability for these companies to come together  and take out cost.  Whether it's in a form of jobs, of sales people or R&amp;D,  have actually quite effective in driving the bottom line.</p><p> Again, but not necessarily feeding into the sentiment of where the  countries going right now, which is going to be by creating jobs, is how I  think they need reposition themselves around trying to put companies  together in accelerated top line as opposed to just take out cost.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  I got it.  Thanks, Gregg, good to have you.</p><p> LEMKAU:  Thanks, Jeff.</p><p> MCCRACKEN:  Back to you, Vonnie.</p><p>  [*]  END ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Yeah, you're right, it's quite a list. Welcome, Gregg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LEMKAU: Thank you.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So, 2016 was a good year, not quite up to the standards of say 2015. We had obviously big global deals, buyer in Monsanto, A.T., Time Warner, et cetera. What do you looking at 2017? What is your crystal ball say?</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, I think the outlook for M&amp;A in 2017 is quite strong. A lot of the factors that existed in 2015 and '16 that drive activity continue to persist. So you have low interest rates. You got abundantly available capital. You've got limited growth opportunities for corporate organically. And you have positive equity markets.</p><p>So that's all still in place. I think more importantly, some of the headwinds we saw in 2016, it's slowdown activity, are started this upside. And I think specifically, the regulatory environment. I think the expectation is we'll have a little bit of an easier regulatory ..</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Thanks again, Vonnie. I appreciate it. Sorry about that, Gregg.</p><p>LEMKAU: Sure.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: And I want to talk, so we wanted to give him an opportunity.</p><p>LEMKAU: Good idea.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: As you were saying, you expect easier regulatory environment in 2017.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. I think the expectation 2017 will be a bit of a loose for regulatory environment. And when you combine that with what we expect to be corporate tax reform, and in particular cash repatriation. It's actually a general sense of optimism in the business community, in particular, in corporate America that seems to be driving the desire to go out and be much more proactive on the strategic front.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So how does repatriation? Is that something that's talk a lot about by, a lot by the M&amp;A bankers in the M&amp;A words? How do you think that might impact M&amp;A? Because so many deals we've seen, you know, J&amp;J right now talking to Kellyanne, a lot of these companies with offshore cast have used that to do deals in Europe, what happens if they bring that cash back to United States?</p><p>LEMKAU: So there something between $1 trillion to $2 trillion of cash trapped offshore by U.S. companies, and now the expectation will be able to bring that back in a relatively low tax rate and deployed in the U.S., so under deployed in a form of capital expenditures or in the form of M&amp;A.</p><p>You've seen companies do lots of acquisitions outside the U.S. using that cash, but there a lot more targets in the U.S. and I think companies with the ability to deploy that capital in the U.S. whether it's a trillion or $2 trillion, and the cash that continue to generate back in the U.S., you'll see a big pick up in activity domestically.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Yeah. And what are the industries that have the most offshore cash, is it tech for the most product?</p><p>LEMKAU: It's really the biggest the company. So it's mostly tech in big pharma but it's Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, J&amp;J. You saw a lot of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to do things to be able to access that cash offshore via M&amp;A. If they can just bring that back and use it and deploy it via M&amp;A in the U.S. they'll be able to do that much more easily.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So they can bring it back, they'll use it for dividens. They'll use it for probably share the purchases, and then use for M&amp;A is the anticipation if you will.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: OK. Will biotech and technology companies have a lot of cash as you were --</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. It's really the big pharma companies with the big pharma companies as they look to grow, they probably going to deploy against biotech where the real fuel and the ability to drag the top line.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Do you expect other certain trends that emerge in a given year? You know, when -- in 2016, you look back in a couple of years, you say that was the year of X or in 2008-2009, that was a certain, you know, era. What would you expect the trends might be in 2017?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes. I think the big wave in 2017 partly fueled some of these cash repatriations, is going to be a significant amount of transaction across technology, media and telecom. You've seen the conversion happen in that sector, it was pretty remarkable. You've seen big transaction where Comcast bought NBC, Time Warner and AT&amp;T trying to come together, even Verizon and Yahoo to an extent.</p><p>But the big distribution companies, looking to buy content, and the desire for this big media companies and big technology companies to get access to content and to get closer, to get some risk critical.

I mean, imagine uttering that sentence five years ago.</p><p>And so, these companies acknowledging media and telecom, all of these are in content, all of these are in to get closer to consumer. I think needing to do that a lot via M&amp;A.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: What's interesting is Amazon and Google, and even Apple have lots of cash. You know, everyday they're building our money, but they haven't done a lot of big deals. Do you expect that changes at some point? That they acquire, you know, acquire the arrivals or acquire entertainment companies.</p><p>LEMKAU: You see, that's the great question. I think these companies, you know, the five biggest market cap companies in the world are all with these big tech companies. They all happen to have big cash balances, sitting offshore, able to be brought back. And they've been really under penetrated in M&amp;A.</p><p>So the real question is, when they will go pursue that as their top line growth starts to slow, which started. It's a natural time to do it. As the industry starts to converge is a natural time to do it. And the real question that really comes down to this regulatory piece, will the regulators allows them to do that, not just from the anti-trust standpoint but over our regulation where there's the FCC or the E.C. or the DOJ, of the FTC, will allow these big companies to get bigger via M&amp;A.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Is it the Goldman expectation, your expectation that the Trump administration be more like the Bush administration when it comes to anti- trust?</p><p>LEMKAU: I think it will be. You know, it's interesting a lot will remain to be seen. I think the hope is that we'll be a little bit looser. I'd say the Obama administration in the past year in particular, that a lot more stringent around M&amp;A. There were $500 billion of transactions last year that fell way, largely due to anti-trust or interpretation of tax law. But if you look at Pfizer now or Baker Hughes and Halliburton, stay up for people (ph).</p><p>A lot of big deals fell away and the Obama administration kind of heading into their last year, got a lot more aggressive. I think the views that eases up to a degree and whether it returns all the way to that -- was under the Bush administration, that will get to be seen.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Did you see situations where companies considered doing a deal. But, you know what, that will probably get a block here in this administration, let's read for that in a year.</p><p>LEMKAU: I think people that a lot of more anxious really as we head into 2016, and you saw some of these deals fall away. The last thing a board or a CEO wants to do is announce a big strategic transaction and how they can held up by the regulators for a long period of time. And then, ultimately, not happen.</p><p>It paralyzes a company. It's not great for the board. It's not great for the target or the buyer. And if somebody's transaction, we're getting stop, people really back to it in the table. I think if they see a looser regulatory environment, that much, more likely get back to the table.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: So Trump is going to have, he is in that real situation where he's going to have the House and the Senate, you know, but his party if you will. So as there, we're going to see big tax moves not just on repatriation but overall a big tax cut that might impact corporate taxes. How do you think that impacts M&amp;A overall? What's that going to do to a company that's looking to do a deal?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah. I'd say, corporate tax cuts should also be a fuel to M&amp;A. I think you'll see companies that have none core assets. It will be a lot easier to sell them if there's a reduce tax rate, and then having to have tax so we could just selling an asset. You'll see probably more divestitures than spin offs. I think people have been trying to do thing via tax, been off recently.</p><p>The one caveat to all of that is you may see a bit of a pause for awhile until it becomes clear what the tax rate is going to be. So you're going to sell an asset and you don't know if it's going to earn after tax at 35 percent or 25 percent or 15 percent. You probably want to wait to see what that new tax laws going to be but there's meaningful value, apparition around the actual earnings power of what you're selling.</p><p>So you could actually see a bit of a log until there's clarity around the tax report, and then a significant pick up and activity.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: All right. We're going to ask more questions for you. We throw that first back to Vonnie.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Thanks again, Vonnie.</p><p>So as Vonnie said, oil and gas could be busy this year. It was pretty slow in 2015-2016, maybe because a barrel of oil went from 100 something a barrel to as low as like $25 a barrel, I'm sure that had a big impact. What's your view or what oil and gas is going to do in 2017?</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, I mean, look at where the big energy companies, the oil and gas companies in particular, spent their time in focus in the past two years. It was really fixing their balance sheets and fixing their cost structures for dramatically reduce oil price. I had to figure out how to survive.</p><p>Lots of that self help is behind him, and you've got recovering oil price and you've got this general sense of optimism in the market that is likely to have all of them a lot more proactive around strategic activities. So I think you'll see a meaningful pick up in activity in the oil and gas piece, especially relative to what we saw in 2015 and 2016.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: What kind of impact does it have for a company when, you know, your core commodity, if the price of that is dropping so dramatically, you know, as I said, went from 100 I think in 2014 to below 30 in 2016. I mean, that just can't help a company who is thinking of putting himself on a block or considering expending billions to buy somebody.</p><p>LEMKAU: Well, it's fascinating. I think the companies that are in survival mode, need to really fix that capital structure. And most of them were built with CapEx budgets that didn't support $50 or that was more like $100 oil, so had a dramatically reshape that. I think the biggest companies who were positioned for the sustained downturn, weren't like they go and fix something off in the bottom because they want to make sure it was going to survive. They might rather see it go through bankruptcy and pick up the pieces.</p><p>I think a lot of the companies have now gotten through that, but the bottom has been hit and we start to recover and I think the biggest companies will feel a lot better about consolidating. And I think the smaller companies will fell like they not getting to a point where they can realize the value of doing an M&amp;A transaction.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: It makes sense. It makes sense.</p><p>I want to circle back on something we're talking about earlier, which is M&amp;A trust environment.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yes.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: And how -- there's a lot of things that would make a banker or a lawyer feel optimistic. What are some of the things that could be a concern in the M&amp;A trust world? Because obviously, Donald Trump has been really fixated on jobs and maybe that starts to play into and could dampen some M&amp;A this year.</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah, I think that's right. I think a lot in the world is going to wait and see because you have a sense for how the new administration might behave in a pro business way but not exactly how they going to behave on any specific transaction or on transactions probably define. Lots of this consolidating transactions over the past year, who have been focus within the cost, which largely means taking that jobs. I think that's not going to be a sound bite or not going to be a narrative, this going to be particularly appealing in this administration.</p><p>I think the company is going to focus on doing big M&amp;A transactions in particular, and the U.S. should be focus on, you know, creating a U.S. champion, or creating a winner in the U.S., of a global industry. And then, they go about doing an M&amp;A transaction to create and focusing on growth and not focusing on cost cutting.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Are there particular industries where jobs are more likely to be part of the equation in a big deal like industrial companies or oil and gas even?</p><p>LEMKAU: Yeah. I think the big consolidating transactions that have largely work have been industrial consolidation. We've actually seen it in consumer consolidation, the ability for these companies to come together and take out cost. Whether it's in a form of jobs, of sales people or R&amp;D, have actually quite effective in driving the bottom line.</p><p>Again, but not necessarily feeding into the sentiment of where the countries going right now, which is going to be by creating jobs, is how I think they need reposition themselves around trying to put companies together in accelerated top line as opposed to just take out cost.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: I got it. Thanks, Gregg, good to have you.</p><p>LEMKAU: Thanks, Jeff.</p><p>MCCRACKEN: Back to you, Vonnie.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The project could launch as soon as March, one of them said. </p><p>Goldman, which declined to comment, is in the midst of a transformation from a trading and investment banking powerhouse into a broader financial services group that more closely resembles rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. David Solomon, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, last week told shareholders that the bank would boost returns by generating revenues from new sources such as consumer banking and wealth management.</p><p>For Amazon, a Goldman deal would be in line with Jeff Bezos\u2019s push to turn the company into an infrastructure provider that profits from a growing chunk of online trade by charging for a host of commercial services offered to other companies.</p><p>John Cronin, an analyst at Goodbody\u2019s, the brokerage, said banking partnerships could allow Amazon to \u201csignificantly extend\u201d its small and medium-sized business lending platform \u201cwithout any associated credit risk of regulatory obligations\u201d.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the Goldman talks but said lending was one of the services provided to \u201cour selling partners, mostly small and medium-sized businesses, who account for more than half of everything sold in Amazon\u2019s stores\u201d. </p><p>Amazon has already expanded far beyond its origins as an online bookseller by building businesses that sell petabytes of cloud computing space and state-of-the-art warehouse facilities to a variety of businesses.</p><p>It had outstanding small business loans of more than $863m on its own balance sheet at the end of 2019. For the past eight years it has lent to small businesses that sell on its site, using the data it holds on their cash positions to offer quick-decision loans in a handful of countries.\u00a0</p><p>An agreement with Amazon would follow last year\u2019s credit card partnership between Goldman and Apple, which featured the bank\u2019s branding on the physical card and in some marketing and gave Goldman a direct channel to Apple\u2019s more than 100m US subscribers.</p><p>Executives at Goldman, which lacks the physical branch network that most banks use to attract small and medium-sized business customers, have described the Apple Card as the \u201cmost successful credit card launch ever\u201d. Card lending is known to account for a significant portion of the $7bn of consumer loans and card balances the bank had at the end of last year. Goldman also offers consumer lending in the US through Marcus, its retail banking arm.</p><p>Goldman\u2019s new consumer ventures accounted for less than 3 per cent of revenue last year, while the cards and consumer loan balances at the end of 2019 were less than 1 per cent of its $993bn in total assets.\u00a0</p><p>At its recent investor day it said it would pursue \u201cbanking-as-a-service\u201d this year, which involves banks allowing third parties to \u201cwhite label\u201d their products.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-41866efe452111eaaeb3955839e06441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4C-T0G1-JB77-K3B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><timeReceived>2:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Take it away, Brad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you, Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the interviewee?</p><p/><p>GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p/><p>STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary competitor, Google, is collecting that data?</p><p/><p>COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up there.</p><p/><p>STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach at some point?</p><p/><p>COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number, it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to $38 billion in China alone.</p><p/><p>STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March?</p><p/><p>COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old watch in there.</p><p/><p>STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking. How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different about these companies now?</p><p/><p>COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.</p><p/><p>STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.</p><p/><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p/><p>STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.</p><p/><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p/><p>STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?</p><p/><p>COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.</p><p/><p>STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?</p><p/><p>COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.</p><p/><p>STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.</p><p/><p>COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.</p><p/><p>STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?</p><p/><p>COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.</p><p/><p>STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?</p><p/><p>COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.</p><p/><p>STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why?</p><p/><p>COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.</p><p/><p>STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?</p><p/><p>COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.</p><p/><p>The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move relatively quickly $10, --</p><p/><p>STONE: We could see the price still and go down.</p><p/><p>COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that storage work in the market.</p><p/><p>STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements, you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates. Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed?</p><p/><p>COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world seems to have changed.</p><p/><p>STONE: But you're not convinced.</p><p/><p>COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States, you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get weaker.</p><p/><p>All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise interest rates.</p><p/><p>STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances.</p><p/><p>COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move.</p><p/><p>STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year?</p><p/><p>COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very tough position.</p><p/><p>STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward?</p><p/><p>COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us. And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our clients need on a daily basis.</p><p/><p>STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you need to change?</p><p/><p>COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me.</p><p/><p>STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Take it away, Brad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you, Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the interviewee?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p>STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary competitor, Google, is collecting that data?</p><p>COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up there.</p><p>STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach at some point?</p><p>COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number, it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to $38 billion in China alone.</p><p>STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March?</p><p>COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old watch in there.</p><p>STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking. How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different about these companies now?</p><p>COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.</p><p>STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?</p><p>COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.</p><p>STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?</p><p>COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.</p><p>STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.</p><p>COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.</p><p>STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?</p><p>COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.</p><p>STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?</p><p>COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.</p><p>STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why?</p><p>COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.</p><p>STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?</p><p>COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.</p><p>The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>STONE: We could see the price still and go down.</p><p>COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that storage work in the market.</p><p>STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements, you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates. Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed?</p><p>COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world seems to have changed.</p><p>STONE: But you're not convinced.</p><p>COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States, you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get weaker.</p><p>All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise interest rates.</p><p>STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances.</p><p>COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move.</p><p>STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year?</p><p>COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very tough position.</p><p>STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward?</p><p>COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us. And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our clients need on a daily basis.</p><p>STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you need to change?</p><p>COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me.</p><p>STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Take it away, Brad. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you,  Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing  Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the  interviewee? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to  interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p>      STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for  me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or  purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement  of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary  competitor, Google, is collecting that data? </p><p>      COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and  internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty  well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell  iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in  the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business  decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up  there.  </p><p>      STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion  in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean  what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is  reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach  at some point?</p><p>      COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number,  it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is  known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim  they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked  about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to  $38 billion in China alone. </p><p>      STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March? </p><p>      COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old  watch in there. </p><p>      STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle  here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb,  Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking.  How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks  and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different  about these companies now? </p><p>      COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The  last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you  just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating  real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone,  and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we  are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products,  hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is  servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and  getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network  literally every day. </p><p>      STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of  innovation as an investor. </p><p>      COHN: Yes. </p><p>      STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round. </p><p>      COHN: Yes. </p><p>      STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional  investment banking business? </p><p>      COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in  the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital,  which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And  that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at  various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in  these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and  the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become  public companies. </p><p>      STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year  when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone  company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it  sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go  public? </p><p>      COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous  amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the  extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital,  have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they  want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right  now. </p><p>      STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking  right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon  Valley calendar. </p><p>      COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you  measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've  got other equally as important franchises. </p><p>      STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon,  Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in  Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why  is the bond market so appealing right now? </p><p>      COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in  Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in  Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow  money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in  euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower  than it is in dollars right now. </p><p>      STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much  fundraising now happening in the bond market? </p><p>      COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are  going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can  raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to  them in what is going on in the European economy. </p><p>      STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars,  basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was  concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why? </p><p>      COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a  never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and  you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And  the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live  with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a  stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are  having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue  against something. </p><p>      STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil  perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded  somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what  does that mean for American business? </p><p>      COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could  go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market  right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent  moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market  is trying to figure out an equilibrium price. </p><p>      The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point  we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very  limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in  certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see  gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to  price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make  second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of  those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move  relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>      STONE: We could see the price still and go down. </p><p>      COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that  storage work in the market. </p><p>      STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements,  you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates.  Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed? </p><p>      COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world  seems to have changed. </p><p>      STONE: But you're not convinced. </p><p>      COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has  changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar  again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what  happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States,  you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get  weaker. </p><p>      All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United  States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to  continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise  interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise  interest rates. </p><p>      STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances. </p><p>      COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will  be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries  around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is  another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United  States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central  bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move. </p><p>      STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year? </p><p>      COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very  tough position. </p><p>      STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The  regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis  seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe  less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward? </p><p>      COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the  regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy  to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding  how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount  of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us.  And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory  environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our  capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there  for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our  clients need on a daily basis. </p><p>      STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the  most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you  need to change? </p><p>      COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me. </p><p>      STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much. </p><p>  [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Take it away, Brad. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you,  Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing  Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the  interviewee? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to  interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p>      STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for  me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or  purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement  of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary  competitor, Google, is collecting that data? </p><p>      COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and  internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty  well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell  iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in  the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business  decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up  there.  </p><p>      STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion  in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean  what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is  reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach  at some point?</p><p>      COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number,  it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is  known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim  they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked  about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to  $38 billion in China alone. </p><p>      STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March? </p><p>      COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old  watch in there. </p><p>      STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle  here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb,  Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking.  How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks  and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different  about these companies now? </p><p>      COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The  last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you  just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating  real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone,  and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we  are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products,  hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is  servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and  getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network  literally every day. </p><p>      STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of  innovation as an investor. </p><p>      COHN: Yes. </p><p>      STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round. </p><p>      COHN: Yes. </p><p>      STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional  investment banking business? </p><p>      COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in  the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital,  which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And  that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at  various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in  these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and  the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become  public companies. </p><p>      STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year  when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone  company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it  sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go  public? </p><p>      COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous  amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the  extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital,  have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they  want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right  now. </p><p>      STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking  right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon  Valley calendar. </p><p>      COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you  measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've  got other equally as important franchises. </p><p>      STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon,  Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in  Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why  is the bond market so appealing right now? </p><p>      COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in  Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in  Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow  money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in  euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower  than it is in dollars right now. </p><p>      STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much  fundraising now happening in the bond market? </p><p>      COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are  going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can  raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to  them in what is going on in the European economy. </p><p>      STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars,  basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was  concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why? </p><p>      COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a  never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and  you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And  the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live  with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a  stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are  having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue  against something. </p><p>      STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil  perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded  somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what  does that mean for American business? </p><p>      COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could  go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market  right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent  moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market  is trying to figure out an equilibrium price. </p><p>      The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point  we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very  limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in  certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see  gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to  price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make  second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of  those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move  relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>      STONE: We could see the price still and go down. </p><p>      COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that  storage work in the market. </p><p>      STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements,  you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates.  Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed? </p><p>      COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world  seems to have changed. </p><p>      STONE: But you're not convinced. </p><p>      COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has  changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar  again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what  happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States,  you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get  weaker. </p><p>      All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United  States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to  continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise  interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise  interest rates. </p><p>      STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances. </p><p>      COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will  be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries  around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is  another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United  States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central  bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move. </p><p>      STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year? </p><p>      COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very  tough position. </p><p>      STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The  regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis  seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe  less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward? </p><p>      COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the  regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy  to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding  how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount  of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us.  And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory  environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our  capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there  for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our  clients need on a daily basis. </p><p>      STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the  most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you  need to change? </p><p>      COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me. </p><p>      STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much. </p><p>  [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.</p><p>STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?</p><p>COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.</p><p>STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?</p><p>COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.</p><p>STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.</p><p>COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.</p><p>STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?</p><p>COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.</p><p>STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?</p><p>COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.</p><p>STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why?</p><p>COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.</p><p>STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?</p><p>COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.</p><p>The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>STONE: We could see the price still and go down.</p><p>COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that storage work in the market.</p><p>STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements, you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates. Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed?</p><p>COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world seems to have changed.</p><p>STONE: But you're not convinced.</p><p>COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States, you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get weaker.</p><p>All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise interest rates.</p><p>STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances.</p><p>COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move.</p><p>STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year?</p><p>COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very tough position.</p><p>STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward?</p><p>COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us. And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our clients need on a daily basis.</p><p>STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you need to change?</p><p>COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me.</p><p>STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Take it away, Brad. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you,  Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing  Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the  interviewee? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to  interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p>STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for  me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or  purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement  of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary  competitor, Google, is collecting that data? </p><p>COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and  internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty  well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell  iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in  the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business  decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up  there.  </p><p>STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion  in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean  what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is  reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach  at some point?</p><p>COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number,  it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is  known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim  they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked  about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to  $38 billion in China alone. </p><p>STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March? </p><p>COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old  watch in there. </p><p>STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle  here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb,  Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking.  How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks  and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different  about these companies now? </p><p>COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The  last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you  just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating  real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone,  and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we  are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products,  hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is  servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and  getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network  literally every day. </p><p>STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of  innovation as an investor. </p><p>COHN: Yes. </p><p>STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round. </p><p>COHN: Yes. </p><p>STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional  investment banking business? </p><p>COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in  the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital,  which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And  that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at  various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in  these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and  the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become  public companies. </p><p>STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year  when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone  company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it  sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go  public? </p><p>COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous  amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the  extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital,  have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they  want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right  now. </p><p>STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking  right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon  Valley calendar. </p><p>COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you  measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've  got other equally as important franchises. </p><p>STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon,  Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in  Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why  is the bond market so appealing right now? </p><p>COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in  Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in  Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow  money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in  euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower  than it is in dollars right now. </p><p>STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much  fundraising now happening in the bond market? </p><p>COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are  going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can  raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to  them in what is going on in the European economy. </p><p>STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars,  basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was  concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why? </p><p>COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a  never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and  you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And  the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live  with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a  stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are  having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue  against something. </p><p>STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil  perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded  somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what  does that mean for American business? </p><p>COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could  go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market  right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent  moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market  is trying to figure out an equilibrium price. </p><p>The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point  we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very  limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in  certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see  gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to  price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make  second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of  those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move  relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>STONE: We could see the price still and go down. </p><p>COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that  storage work in the market. </p><p>STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements,  you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates.  Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed? </p><p>COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world  seems to have changed. </p><p>STONE: But you're not convinced. </p><p>COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has  changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar  again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what  happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States,  you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get  weaker. </p><p>All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United  States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to  continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise  interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise  interest rates. </p><p>STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances. </p><p>COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will  be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries  around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is  another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United  States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central  bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move. </p><p>STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year? </p><p>COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very  tough position. </p><p>STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The  regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis  seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe  less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward? </p><p>COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the  regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy  to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding  how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount  of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us.  And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory  environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our  capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there  for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our  clients need on a daily basis. </p><p>STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the  most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you  need to change? </p><p>COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me. </p><p>STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much. </p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Take it away, Brad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD STONE, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: Thank you, Trish. And thank you, Gary, for being a host today and for doing such a great job interviewing Apple CEO, Tim Cook. How did that feel to be the interviewer instead of the interviewee?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GARY COHN, PRESIDENT AND COO, GOLDMAN SACHS: Oh it's always fun to interview a great CEO like Tim.</p><p>STONE: That's right. Well one of the things he said that stood out for me was about data privacy. Apple is not collecting health care data or purchasing data with things like Apple Pay. He framed that as a statement of values, but is it also good business, seeing as how its primary competitor, Google, is collecting that data?</p><p>COHN: First of all, let me thank you for being at our technology and internet conference. I think Tim stated his corporate objective pretty well. Apple is in the business of selling components. They want to sell iPad's. They want to sell iPhones. They want to sell Macs. They are not in the business of collecting data on their clients. And that's the business decision that Tim has made. And I thought he explained himself very well up there.</p><p>STONE: Now Trish just mentioned that Apple has crossed a $700 billion in market cap threshold for the first time. Is that significant? I mean what does it mean for business, for global business that any company is reaching such highs, and maybe even a one trillion market cap is in reach at some point?</p><p>COHN: It's not significant. It's just a representation. It's a number, it's a size. Apple is an iconic company in America. It's a brand that is known not only in America. It's known worldwide. If you listen to Tim they're talking about their sales growing all over the world. He talked about revenue over the last few years growing from $1 billion dollars to $38 billion in China alone.</p><p>STONE: Will you be buying an Apple Watch in March?</p><p>COHN: I don't know. It was pretty enticing. He was picking on my old watch in there.</p><p>STONE: He was. He was. So we are in the middle of an incredible cycle here in Silicon Valley. We're minting these companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Square. You have been in tech for a while in investment banking. How does this cycle compare to say the last cycle with the social networks and the online communities like Facebook and Twitter? What is different about these companies now?</p><p>COHN: I think it's hard to compare this cycle to the last cycle. The last cycle was a long time ago, and more importantly, the companies you just mentioned, the Airbnbs, the Dropboxes, the Ubers, they are creating real products that you and I are using every day. When we go on that phone, and we hit that Uber button and that car shows up, we are using it and we are paying for those services. These are not companies designing products, hoping that we will someday use them and they'll create profit. Uber is servicing their customers every day, and creating revenue by doing it, and getting more and more acceptance and creating a bigger worldwide network literally every day.</p><p>STONE: Right. Now Goldman Sachs has been active in this round of innovation as an investor.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: You were in Facebook and Mobileye, Uber's latest round.</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>STONE: Is the investment business now as important as the traditional investment banking business?</p><p>COHN: Well we are in the business of raising capital. And we are in the business of matching people with capital with people that need capital, which enables the economy to grow, which enables us to create jobs. And that's our business. So we have been involved with these companies at various stages of their career and evolution, and we just continuously be - - are involved with them. And so, yes, we have been involved lately in these new rounds. And we'll continue to be involved with the next round and the next round. Eventually, we believe all of these companies will become public companies.</p><p>STONE: And so let's talk about that then. Is it -- is 2015 the year when we think about these unicorns, Xiaomi, the Chinese mobile phone company, Uber, maybe Airbnb? Everyone sort of wants to know when. Is it sooner rather than later that we might see some of these companies go public?</p><p>COHN: I don't know. I don't know. Right now there is an enormous amount of capital available in the system. And so these companies to the extent they need working capital, and not all of them need working capital, have an enormous availability of capital to them. So to the extent they want to stay private longer, capital is not the constraining item right now.</p><p>STONE: Right. Is -- is tech the biggest sector for investment banking right now? I mean this has become really a cornerstone of the Silicon Valley calendar.</p><p>COHN: It's not necessarily the biggest, but I don't know how you measure size. Our tech franchise is a very important franchise to us. We've got other equally as important franchises.</p><p>STONE: So explain this to me. Some of the big tech companies, Amazon, Apple are raising money in the bond market now, and sometimes over in Europe. Given that in some cases these are very profitable companies, why is the bond market so appealing right now?</p><p>COHN: Rates are low. Rates are very low. Rates are extremely low in Europe. They're lower than dollar rates. To the extent you can use money in Europe, you are borrowing money. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in Swiss franc. We have seen a bunch of companies borrow money in euros. The all-in borrowing costs in those places is substantially lower than it is in dollars right now.</p><p>STONE: Is there anything worrying about that that there's so much fundraising now happening in the bond market?</p><p>COHN: No. These companies are sound, fundamental companies. They are going to raise debt. They are raising it in the cheapest place they can raise it, and they are taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them in what is going on in the European economy.</p><p>STONE: So at Davos last month you talked about currency wars, basically countries using currency to fuel growth. And you said that was concerning to you. Is that -- do you see, still see that happening and why?</p><p>COHN: It is concerning to me. It's concerning to me because it's a never-ending cycle. If you're out there devaluating your currency and you're forcing me to devalue my currency, how do you stop this game? And the flip side of it, we in the United States are having to learn to live with a stronger and stronger dollar, not necessarily because we have got a stronger and stronger economy. And although our economy is strong, we are having a stronger and stronger dollar because you have got to devalue against something.</p><p>STONE: I see. And you also said that you forecasted the price of oil perhaps going down as low $30 a barrel. Of course it has rebounded somewhat. What do you see happening in the oil markets right now and what does that mean for American business?</p><p>COHN: Well I answered the question. It could go to $200 and it could go to $30. I said, yes, could be true to both of them. So the oil market right now is in a very fluid situation. We have seen five, ten percent moves over days and weeks in the last few weeks, but I think the oil market is trying to figure out an equilibrium price.</p><p>The danger here as we try and find an equilibrium price at some point we may end up in a situation where storage capacity gets very, very limited. We may have too much physical oil for the available storage in certain locations, and it might be a locational issue. And you may just see gluts of oil in certain locations around the world where oil will have to price to such a cheap discount vis-a-vis the forward price that you make second tier, and third tier and fourth tier storage available. So in one of those scenarios, which could happen relatively quickly as we saw oil move relatively quickly $10, --</p><p>STONE: We could see the price still and go down.</p><p>COHN: You could see the price fall relatively quickly to make that storage work in the market.</p><p>STONE: Okay, continuing on the theme of addressing past statements, you have expressed concern over the Fed's ability to raise interest rates. Of course we had a good jobs report recently. Has that equation changed?</p><p>COHN: We had one good job report last Friday, and the whole world seems to have changed.</p><p>STONE: But you're not convinced.</p><p>COHN: I am not convinced that one good jobs report last Friday has changed the whole world. You did see in that good jobs report the dollar again rally, gain strength, euro declined. So again if you look at what happened last week, you had interest rates go higher in the United States, you had oil go higher in the United States. And basically the dollar get weaker.</p><p>All those by themselves are making financial conditions in the United States tighter and tighter. So I actually think the Fed is going to continuously be in this tough dilemma where they are going to want to raise interest rates, and I fundamentally understand why they want to raise interest rates.</p><p>STONE: But they're constrained by the circumstances.</p><p>COHN: They're going to be constrained by circumstances and they will be concerned about the strengthening of the dollar. And other countries around the world are going to continue to devalue. Remember, devaluation is another way to export your disinflation that is coming into the United States. So I do think they're going to be in a tough position, and central bankers tend to need to see the real inflation before they move.</p><p>STONE: So prediction time, will we see a rate increase this year?</p><p>COHN: I don't really make predictions. I think the Fed is in a very tough position.</p><p>STONE: Okay. Let me ask you about the future of Goldman Sachs. The regulatory environment over the past few years since the financial crisis seems to have changed the equation for a lot of investment banks, maybe less so at Goldman Sachs. Do you see that changing going forward?</p><p>COHN: The regulatory environment is what it is. We've talked about the regulatory environment nonstop for five years. In some respects we're happy to be getting a lot of the regulatory environment behind us, understanding how to run our business, what we need to do to run our business, the amount of capital we need to run our business. Those are all very helpful for us. And we're operating our business the best we can in the regulatory environment we have. We're trying to be as effective as we can with our capital, capital allocation, doing that while making sure we're being there for our clients, serving our clients and being able to accommodate what our clients need on a daily basis.</p><p>STONE: But does it bother you that Goldman Sachs is ranked among the most hated companies in America? Do you feel like that's something that you need to change?</p><p>COHN: Of course. Of course it bothers me.</p><p>STONE: Yes, understand. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs, thank you very much.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The talks were first reported by the Financial Times on Monday. The partnership would be the second inked by Goldman with a large technology firm that can provide the scale and distribution for Goldman's products that it can't get itself.

Click here for more BI Prime content[1]. Goldman Sachs is close to inking a second high-profile deal to offer banking services in partnership with a large tech company, and it's a sign of what may be a fundamental change in retail banking. Goldman is in talks with Amazon to offer small business loans to merchants who sell products on Amazon, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The Financial Times first reported the talks on Monday. Goldman's small business loans may feature the bank's name and begin as soon as March, the newspaper said. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. If the deal is signed, it would become the second Big Tech partnership for Goldman Sachs after it launched a credit card last year with Apple last year. Goldman CEO David Solomon has called the Apple Card the most successful credit card launch of all time, without providing details to back up the claim. But it would also be a sign of something much more ambitious: Goldman Sachs moving quickly and aggressively to leverage those characteristics that make it uniquely a bank, with a license that allows it to offer banking products and a balance sheet where it can fund loans cheaply being just two prominent examples. The company has been sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into building out its technology capabilities, including APIs (application programming interfaces)[2], to make it as easy and seamless to plug such services into the technology platforms of others, whether that's Apple's mobile devices, as with the Apple Card, or Amazon's retail platform. At an investor day last week, execs referred to it as banking-as-a-service,[3] but some insiders have taken to calling it Goldman Sachs-as-a-service. Stephanie Cohen, Goldman's chief strategy officer, appeared on stage last week at the bank's investor day alongside Marco Argenti, the co-chief information officer who recently joined the bank after several years as a senior exec at Amazon Web Services. Cohen said the bank is looking for ways to use technology to embed the types of things that Goldman can do well, such as risk management, or loan underwriting. Cohen cited the Apple Card, which is a Goldman-designed product delivered on Apple's devices, as one such example. \"That last capability is the consumer version of our platform strategy,\" Cohen said. \"It allows us to take products and services that we build for our own clients and then give it to other clients so that they can embed financial products into their ecosystem. This strategy will drive top-line growth, and it will create scale efficiencies.\" Goldman isn't the only large bank that's working with Big Tech companies. In November, Google announced a partnership with Citigroup to provide checking accounts to the tech firm's customers. And yet, Goldman is probably doing it better than anyone because it has developed a suite of APIs that it can take off the shelf and plug into other platforms, according to Richard Crone, an independent consultant. \"Goldman Sachs, when they write the history books, will be noted as the one who invented or perfected embedded banking, where you embed your financial services through the user interface, or at the edge, of someone else's network,\" Crone said. \"If Goldman can get this right with Amazon, I would expect them to go to Facebook next or any other online platform of substance that provides them a large distribution channel.\" Goldman is leaning on many of the lessons it learned in its partnership with Apple, known as an incredibly demanding partner, Crone said. Most notably, the ability to offer instant issuance to a set of customers that have already been pre-validated, multi-factor authenticated, Know-Your-Customer credentialed by the large tech firms. \"They already know the customer, but they have met the regulatory requirement in advance before they hand it over,\" he said. The product will likely look similar to what small merchants are getting from Square Cash or PayPal Working Capital. Goldman has bigger ambitions. At last week's investor day, the bank presented a slide[4] that showed a product called Marcus Pay, which talked about point-of-sale solutions for merchants based on its digital consumer bank. This is just another example of how embedded banking is here to stay, which can be hard for a lot of bankers to understand because they want to service customers through their own app, Crone said. But \"no financial institution can reach the scale that's required to compete electronically\" with the large platforms if they only do it through their own app, he said.  \"If Goldman can pull off an embedded banking deal somewhere else besides Apple Pay, or if Citigroup can pull off Google Cache, that's a leading indicator of a fundamental change in retail banking.\" See also: Goldman Sachs just unveiled hundreds of slides laying out the future of the company.

Late last week David Heinemeir Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails and CTO of software development firm Basecamp, published aseries of tweets[1] voicing his frustration with the algorithms used to determine the Apple Card's credit limits, reads a new report[2] from Bloomberg. </p><p>Noticing a discrepancy between the credit limit he was offered and the credit limit offered to his wife, entrepreneur tweeted: 'The Apple Card is such a fucking sexist program. My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work.' The day after the thread was posted, Hansson's wife was given the same spending limit after discussions with several Apple representatives, and the discovery that her credit score was in fact higher than his. He said and his wife bought their credit scores from TransUnion, but that score is based on the VantageScore algorithm and may give results that are different from the FICO credit score that most lenders use.The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019. \u2014 Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) November 10, 2019[3]While pleased with the outcome, Hansson still questioned the integrity of the algorithm that had decided his wife's initial spending limit, and why the people they had spoken to were so confident in its accuracy despite having no way of examining it. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak responded to Hansson's tweet, saying: 'The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.' New York state regulators have now announced an investigation into Goldman Sachs, the bank that issues the Apple Card after a series of viral tweets from other consumers were also shared. A spokesperson for the New York Department of Financial Services later issued a statement: 'Any algorithm, that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.'

The vibe is decidedly US West Coast start-up, and that's the way Jeff Winner likes it.</p><p>Hired in January to run what will eventually be an 80-person office, Mr Winner helps lead the engineering team for Marcus by Goldman Sachs, the firm's digital consumer bank that's supposed to take in $1bn ((EURO)814m) in revenue by 2020.</p><p>Competing for talent with the likes of Google and Amazon means out with bespoke suits and in with jeans and runners.</p><p>The bank still has a \"significant amount of stuffiness, but they're getting rid of it\", said Mr Winner.</p><p>Mr Winner (55) moved to Goldman after stints leading engineering teams for Twitter, Uber, and most recently Stripe, the payments giant founded by Limerick brothers John and Patrick Collison.</p><p>The start-up culture Mr Winner is pushing is part of Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein's drive to adapt the 149-year-old firm to a world in which technology underpins almost every pursuit and recruits demand a flexible work environment.</p><p>Mr Winner brought updated interviewing techniques to developing Marcus, including structured, rubric-driven interviews and pair programming, where two people sit together and take turns writing and evaluating code, he said.</p><p>Prior financial services experience is discouraged as he tries to infuse a more entrepreneurial culture throughout the company.</p><p>What's different with Marcus is that engineers weighing a move to Goldman Sachs can see the product before they arrive for their first interview, according to Omer Ismail, the unit's chief commercial officer.</p><p>Since they interact with banks in their personal lives, they can more easily understand their underlying mission. Their job includes a weekly meeting that starts with recordings of two customer service calls: one handled successfully and another that ends with a dissatisfied customer.</p><p>\"Engineers like taking complex problems and removing the friction for end users,\" Mr Ismail said. \"They see how financial services are broken in their personal lives.\"</p><p>A decade ago, Goldman Sachs became shorthand for politicians demonising Wall Street greed as a cause of the financial crisis.</p><p>And the industry's thicket of regulations and decades-old mainframe infrastructure made it seem stodgy to a generation of computer scientists looking to move fast.</p><p>With the backlash mounting over Facebook's sale of consumer data and Amazon's influence over a struggling brick-andmortar retail industry, finance may be becoming an easier sell.</p><p>That's not to say there isn't more work to do.</p><p>\"This is a big company, making a strategic change,\" Mr Winner said. \"The simple thing would be to recruit a team from all the big financial players.

With its unbelievable performance in the past 8 months, gold trading is booming, and prices are skyrocketing. Here\u2019s why you should invest in this safe-haven commodity today....</p><p>*This content is brought to you by     Gold is the gift that keeps on giving in 2020. With its unbelievable performance in the past 8 months, gold trading is booming, and prices are skyrocketing. Here\u2019s why you should invest in this safe-haven commodity today.   In August 2019, gold (XAU/USD) was barely scraping past $1500 an ounce, but the economic fallout of the pandemic and the ensuing risk-off mood led to increased demand in the yellow metal. As of August 6, gold price has breached the all-important $2,000 barrier and is continuing to grow. The question on every trader\u2019s mind \u2013 is it a sprint or a marathon?   Let\u2019s look at the gold price, what affects it in 2020 and how you can take advantage of the uptrend in this precious commodity.    Gold market snapshot  The meteoric rise of gold reached all-time highs of $2,068 on August 6, following investors\u2019 disillusionment in the U.S dollar.   Technical analysis suggests that its growth is due a correction but overall, the market remains bullish as the potential for dip-buying will continue. The precious metal has risen more than 35% in 2020 despite the coronavirus playing havoc with the global economy.   If the past 8 months are any indication, the bullish sentiment in gold could persist throughout August. In fact, the commodity has recorded new highs almost every month so far in 2020, greatly surpassing its previous all-time high of $1,821 in the beginning August 2011.   Gold-based ETFs recorded their eighth consecutive month of positive growth; 166 tonnes ($9.7bn) were recorded in July, equivalent to 4.1% of assets under management (AUM). Global AUM was recorded at $239bn.   !     Top reasons why you should be trading in gold:   30% rise in year-to-date prices More active than big-tech stocks Stable growth despite the ongoing economic crisis Bullish sentiment translates to buying opportunities Could breach $3,000 in 2020   Weathering the Covid-19 storm  Low and negative interest rates, especially in Europe, have reduced the opportunity cost of owning the commodity, further supporting its rise.   Prices could also increase due to a drop in supply of gold ore from mining companies. Many industries are reeling from Covid-19-related shutdowns and as a result, factories were forced to shut down, further propelling the gold price.   Enthusiasm for the precious metal is being driven by investors who view it as a much \u201csafer bet\u201d than relying on the central banks to curb the economic damage of the coronavirus.   With the dollar\u2019s collapse, gold is viewed as insurance against accelerating price increases across the globe.  Onwards and upwards  From 2016 to 2019, the performance of gold can be directly aligned with falling global long-term interest rates. In early 2020, once lockdowns and economic shutdowns had begun in earnest, gold\u2019s rally can be attributed to coronavirus fears and the crippling of the US dollar, which suffered from heavy sell-off due to market uncertainty.  Retail Gold Investment Principles  The , the organization governing the global gold industry, has launched its new Retail Gold Investment Principles (RGIPs), designed to regulate standards for \u201cproduct providers across the global retail gold market and further encourage retail investors to place their trust in gold\u201d. What this means for stakeholders is more engagement with the industry to define best practices.   David Tait, CEO World Gold Council said: \u201cWe have taken time over the past year to engage with a wide range of industry stakeholders representing different global regions and a diverse range of business models to understand how we can best support the retail gold investment industry. Our common objective is simple; make certain that investors, especially those considering gold for the first time, have absolute trust in the products they are offered and the providers with whom they chose to transact.\u201d   \u201cThrough this industry engagement it was clear to us that the market would benefit from a globally aligned set of best practices to ensure an effective, efficient and trusted market overall, and we believe the Principles do just that.\u201d   Top gold trading tips:   Consider whether markets are at risk Review the performance of the US Dollar and the gold price Keep track of central bank gold reserves Research the demand for gold jewellery and cosmetics Research the current industrial demand for gold Consider potential supply disruptions The pandemic \u2013 the slow road to recovery   It will be a long time before the global economy recovers and even then, things won\u2019t be the same. The Coronavirus outbreak has affected all sectors of business with mass closures, rising unemployment and stock market dips.   There are some indications that Asia and Europe could recover but at a global level, a fast recovery is a forlorn hope. Instead, traders should prepare for a long road to recovery.   Central banks have cut interest rates while national governments, as well as the EU, have approved staggering rescue plans to support local economies. These initiatives have seen stock markets rally while gold continues to climb even higher.   The price of gold has more than doubled since 2008 and increased by just below 30% since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier in March 2020. Investors, however, fear that economic stimulus plans to curb the pandemic-led downturn could see hyperinflation and the devaluing of other assets.  The jewellery conundrum   While investors have embraced gold as a haven to hedge their trading portfolios, consumer demand for the precious metal remains weak.   Like many industries, the cosmetic and jewellery markets have suffered severely due to lockdowns hampering supply and crippling demand.   The annual Gold Demand Trends report shows demand for jewellery, one of the key gold-based markets, dropped by 46% in 2020 so far while bar and coin similarly dropped by 17%. Consumption of a product contributes to the health of its raw material production. And while, in the short term, gains can be made as the gold price climbs, low demand could affect the price direction.  How to take advantage of this opportunity?   So, the gold price has breached the all-important $2,000 an ounce barrier but you\u2019re unsure how to take advantage of this?

(On Wednesday, bank chief executives were being grilled by Congress.)</p><p>  Although it won't address all of Big Tech's problems, a simple rule that bolsters the banking system could do a lot to clean up some of the uglier aspects of social media that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>felt compelled to apologize for.</p><p>  The concept is ''know your customer'' -- or KYC, as it's called on Wall Street -- and it's straightforward: Given concerns about privacy, security and fraud when it comes to money, no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background.</p><p>  The idea of applying such a rule to social media has been floated before, but it has so far failed to take hold. Now may be the right time.</p><p>  Consider this: Facebookhas said it shut down over 1.5 billion fake accounts from April through September last year (yes, that's a ''B'' in billion). That was up from the 1.3 billion such accounts it eliminated in the six previous months. To put those numbers in context, Facebookhas a reported user base of 2.3 billion.</p><p>  What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do? You'd probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots.</p><p>  First, let's acknowledge the practical considerations. Vetting the vast universe of those on social media would be a gargantuan task.</p><p>  When I broached the idea of applying a ''know your customer'' principle to their business, several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect, questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat, especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards, and even fixed street addresses can be hard to come by.</p><p>  Then there are the legitimate complaints about Facebookand its ilk already knowing too much about users. Who would want them to know even more? And what would the companies do to protect personal information better than they have in the past? After all, not long ago, Facebookdisclosed that tens of millions of user passwords had not been stored securely.</p><p>  But the stakes may be too high not to consider some kind of heightened verification process.</p><p>Facebookand Twitter, at least, clearly appreciate the importance of verification as a concept: Both offer blue-check-mark programs to confirm the authenticity of a small percentage of users, like celebrities.</p><p>  If the vetting of legitimate users were expanded, and the number of phony ones were reduced, the amount of hate speech and fake news polluting the social media platforms would almost certainly dwindle. And it would be hard for the companies to willfully ignore what remained.</p><p>  How would it work? A modified version of what goes on in the financial services industry is one possibility.</p><p>  When you open a bank account, you typically have to provide your name, address, Social Security number and date of birth.</p><p>  That information is crosschecked against databases to ensure that you're a real person, that your credit score is solid and that your name doesn't appear on a list of ''politically exposed persons'' that could put you at risk for bribery or corruption. The verification is also used to determine whether you have a criminal record that suggests possible money laundering or identity theft.</p><p>  That kind of vetting helps protect banks from doing business with criminals and helps protect clients who could be vulnerable to fraud.</p><p>  There is a precedent for adapting such a regimen for social media: NextDoor, a social network that helps people communicate in their local communities, won't let new users sign up unless their addresses can be verified.</p><p>  A would-be NextDoor user must submit a credit card or phone number, which the site cross-references against databases. If you don't have either, the site sends a postcard to your address with a code you can use online.</p><p>  The good news is that NextDoor knows its customers very well. The bad news is that its verification process would be extremely difficult to expand widely and quickly.</p><p>  The company doesn't disclose user numbers, only that it is in more than 200,000 neighborhoods. Reports suggest it has tens of millions of users, a far cry from the billions using more popular social networks. If introducing such a system at that scale is too daunting, testing it in the United States and Canada first might be one way to start.</p><p>  The need for a ''know your customer'' rule could take on a new urgency as social networks evolve to become fully encrypted private-messaging services, as Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has indicated he plans to do with Facebook.</p><p>  ''I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever,'' he said.</p><p>  It's a laudable goal, but if the users are fake, or otherwise unaccountable, from the outset, the ease with which they could spread misinformation on encrypted networks would have even more troubling implications.</p><p>  That is, unless, there was a viable mechanism for vouching for individual identities -- for networks to know their customers, as it were.</p><p>  It just seems like common sense.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's chief executive, preparing to testify before Congress last year as calls mounted for regulation of big tech companies.

Safe Harbor used to allow\u00a0tech companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft to move user data between data centers if they could guarantee it had an\u00a0'adequate level' of protection, but after Ed Snowden's NSA spying revelations[7], this was struck down. As late as last night,\u00a0Europe's Commissioner for Justice, Consumer and Gender Equality Vera Jourova was working with the US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker to come to a binding decision on a post-Safe Harbor\u00a0data transfer agreement. Commissioner Jourova said the\u00a0deal\u00a0would be 'fundamentally different to Safe Harbour' in order to\u00a0withstand another legal challenge, guarantee citizens their fundamental right to protection of personal data and 'ensure legal certainty for business.'RebrandPrivacy Shield, rebranded to prevent any association with its predecessor, is designed to offer new safeguards around access to data by public authorities and give citizens the right to take legal action against companies using their data. It will also create\u00a0an independent ombudsperson\u00a0role and have an annual review procedure. The commissioner said in a press conference today that this will take just three months to implement. She also made assurances that the rules would still be suitable when new data protection regulations come into force in 2018. Although this appears to offer some guarantee for big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google that they will still be able to move data freely and therefore not have to increase costs to the public, it still has political hurdles to clear first. One such hurdle is the various national data protection bodies, as well legal questions from civil liberties organizations that will no doubt be raised over the protections outlined in the new rules. It is still unclear\u00a0whether legally-binding commitments have been made by the US, something many Members of the European Parliament expressed concern over in a short debate on the proposal last night. Sophie in 't Veld, an MEP from the Netherlands, said: 'If the Americans are serious about this then they will have to pass a law and I don't think they are.' She pointed out that 'signatures at [the] highest political level' outlined by the commissioner would mean very little a year from now when there will be a new president in the White House - especially if that president is Donald Trump. After the debate last night, Ed Snowden waded in with a comment that was retweeted by the original Safe Habour complainant Max Schrems.EU capitulates totally on #SafeHarbor[8]. Interesting, given that they held all the cards.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/GmM8xGWPP6\">https://t.co/GmM8xGWPP6</url>[9]       \u00a0    <url

They are trying to launch the companies whose frameworks set the course for today's technological and cultural landscape.</p><p>There's Netscape, the browser that came before Google; TheGlobe.com, the social network predating Facebook; and YouTube's early counterpart: Pixelon.</p><p>These companies and their founders were part of the rise of Silicon Valley as it's known today, the dot-com \"bubble\" of the 1990s that lead to the dot-com \"bust\" of the early 2000s, and the phenomena by which Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) made Instant Public Millionaires out of company founders.</p><p>Valley of the Boom chronicles in quasi-factual fashion the stories behind the three companies. The show is a weird blend of scripted drama (Bradley Whit-ford plays Netscape CEO James Barks-dale, Steve Zahn plays Pixelon founder and conman \"Michael Fenne,\" and Lamorne Morris plays a fictional investment banker who narrates the show) with real interviews of various characters depicted in the show, tech journalists and the show's executive producer, Arianna Humngton. These are all spliced together with real news footage. This narrative technique makes for a disjointed viewing experience: half documentary, half dramatic re-enactment. Nat Geo also throws a fair amount of meta into the mix, with actors breaking the wall to comment on what's happening, a '90s-style rap battle used to explain the \"browser war\" between Microsoft and Netscape, and a puppet brought in to deliver a Bill Gates speech.</p><p>I had imagined, being old enough to kind of remember the era, that I'd watch the show with fitful nostalgia. In fact, many of its particulars seemed arcane. Halfway through, I realized I had spent very little time in my early 20s contemplating the world of venture capital (nor do I seem to have spent much of my 40s thinking about that topic either). Perhaps more significantly than reinforcing my sorry lack of interest in big finance, the show also fails (thus far; I've got two episodes left in the six-part limited series) to illuminate the current sorry state of the internet.</p><p>Maybe it's not fair to throw the entire internet into the mix. See, there's this thing called the internet. And there are these other entities, whose shadows loom across the story of Valley of the Boom: the aforementioned entities of Google, Face-book and YouTube (not to mention Twitter, Amazon, Apple, etc., etc.). Forget the internet and just call it Big Tech.</p><p>Writing in Time Magazine Jan. 17, Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and Mark Zuckerberg mentor, details his regret and lament about the company's trajectory. (It's an interesting read even though \"I am sad about Facebook' strikes me as an unforgivably soft lead for an essay about the potential destruction of humanity.) I read McNamee's piece in the midst of idle research over one of FB's latest trends, the #10yearchallenge (in which folks create a collage of their profile pics spanning a decade). Out of curiosity, I had made one myself, but hadn't posted it as stories had predictably (and believ-ably) quickly emerged postulating the trend's potential traction as a Big Tech data-collection point for facial recognition algorithms.</p><p>McNamee calls for a variety of reforms tobeginmitigatingthe damage Facebooks \"growth hacking\" strategy has wrought in terms of undermining \"democracy, human rights, privacy, public health and innovation.\" The reforms span categories, from democracy to privacy to public health, but ultimately require revamping the entire architecture of the internet to promote human versus artificial technology. He also calls for regulation of Big Tech companies whose monopolist characters, he writes, have lessened opportunities for innovators and startups.</p><p>McNamee's precis on the state of the internet taken alongside the jocular tone of Valley of the Boom also creates a disjointed experience. Watching the series to investigate first causes (spoiler alert: greed) for present existential threats seems valid. But should it involve musical numbers?</p><p>As it happens, both my #10yearchal-lenge photos included a large glass of wine partially obscuring my aging face but, nonetheless, I abstained from participating for whatever scant good that does in terms of privacy protection. I'm guessing zero good. But perhaps it's a start.</p><p>VALLEY OF THE BOOM</p><p>7 pm Sundays on National Geographic.</p><p>Watch

If they re not, in the long run, I don t think they re fully gaming through the results of what would happen if you really tried to use  good faith  as a standard or they don t care. </p><p>Found in subsection (c)(2) of Section 230, the good-faith <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\"> provision </url> prevents tech platforms from being held civilly liable for  any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. </p><p>Experts say courts have generally ignored the good-faith provision when deciding Section 230 cases, focusing instead on the preceding subsection, which states unequivocally that no tech platform  shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by [a user]. </p><p>But attempts to clarify what good-faith moderation looks like and in some cases, to shoehorn good-faith requirements into the most relevant part of Section 230 have taken center stage in the conservative effort to crack down on big tech s perceived political bias.</p><p>The executive order <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/\"> issued </url> late last month by the White House, which asks the Federal Communications Commission to clarify the conditions under which online restrictions on political speech are made in good faith, is one such attempt. </p><p>So is legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Limiting-Section-230-Immunity-to-Good-Samaritans-Act.pdf\"> introduced </url> Wednesday by Sen. Josh Hawley, which would inject the requirement that tech platforms moderate in good faith into the part of Section 230 most commonly cited by courts. The bill, which several other Republicans have already cosponsored, also tries to craft a statutory definition of what good-faith moderation would look like.</p><p>The focus on good faith can additionally be found in the DOJ's new legislative guidelines, which were also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-recommendations-section-230-reform\"> released </url> Wednesday. Among other things, the DOJ presses Congress to  provide a statutory definition of  good faith  to clarify its original purpose,  adding that the new definition should  limit immunity for content moderation decisions to those done in accordance with plain and particular terms of service and consistent with public representations. </p><p>Daphne Keller, director of the program on platform relations at Stanford s Cyber Policy Center, said the inherent subjectivity of good faith makes it particularly unsuitable as a central plank in any Section 230 reform effort.</p><p> If we could all agree what was fair, or what constituted good faith, this would be a policy we could all get behind,  Keller said.  As it is, though, it leaves huge uncertainty about what actions can get a platform in trouble, which is a problem particularly for small platforms without sophisticated legal teams and deep pockets. </p><p>Experts said that ambiguity is one reason why judges are loath to build Section 230 case law around a good-faith standard. But regulators tasked by the White House with cutting through the ambiguity say they re also ill-suited for the endeavor. </p><p>On Wednesday, Democratic FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said intense scrutiny into the tiny moderation decisions made by a specific platform may be beyond the FCC s limited abilities.</p><p> It does seem to be a fact-intensive inquiry, and something that we don t in particular have extensive experience on here,  Starks said during a virtual panel on the executive order convened by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a centrist think-tank.</p><p>Allowing executive agencies to determine what constitutes  good faith  moderation may also do little to prevent the politicization of such efforts.</p><p> Many of these proposals leave the decision about which platforms are  fair  or  biased  or  not acting in good faith  to political appointees or their teams in places like the DOJ,  said Keller, adding that conservatives have long griped about agency bias in enforcing such standards. </p><p>Other experts noted that such a regime, with agency regulators effectively operating as  speech police,  would struggle to stand up to First Amendment scrutiny.</p><p>If conservatives do succeed in crafting a new liability regime for tech platforms built around good-faith moderation, it s not clear that would lead to fewer takedowns or restraints on political speech. Vague terms of service may be frustrating to users, but if greater specificity could lead to legal liability, tech platforms may stick to generalities. </p><p> The challenge is, what if the platforms write their terms of service in a fairly broad manner?  said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and an expert on Section 230.  Because that s really the one thing it s contingent on. </p><p>There s also the concern that an undue focus on good faith in Section 230 reform could backfire completely by encouraging tech platforms to become explicitly political. In a world where platforms risk liability for violating their terms of service if they remove objectionable content, Stout said many companies may simply rewrite their terms in a way that bans conservative speech altogether.</p><p> Good faith is really a terrible place to start if you re actually thinking about important reforms to 230,  said Stout.  It s a bizarre attack if [Republicans have] actually thought through these things, and they re not just trying to raise funds. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-707674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605J-WN11-JBNW-3532-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Maybe I wasn't I thinking at all and just said what came to my mind. I remember writing about his 'personal' meeting with journalists on board the papal aircraft but the contents of the conversation may have slipped through my fingers during the frenzied blogging that day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The head of the Vatican was a picture of grace, a humble man who appeared to eschew the trappings of spiritual or earthly power. And, for the life of me, I couldn't remember what I told him then even as other media colleagues plastered their pictures with him all over social media.</p><p>I am not quick on the (smartphone camera) draw, you see. I can't think visually and find it embarrassing to train the spotlight on myself. So, what did secular me say mid-air to the religious-political personality who is held in high esteem by 1.3 billion Catholics? I remember now and I shared it with some of my colleagues who haven't stopped laughing since. \"Welcome to the UAE, your Holiness, pray for the media, pray for Khaleej Times,\" was what I said.</p><p>Perhaps I was saving the best for last. Did I sound foolish? One of the Francis' aides, a curious grin on his face, asked, \"You okay?\" as the pope moved on and greeted other journos on the flight.</p><p>Francis wore a permanent smile despite the punishing schedule. He looked radiant in spurts and was pleased to be in the company of journalists unlike other petty and minor leaders who like to set the agenda for even a brief chat or an email interview. Some don't bother to respond after months of pursuing them while others take solace for the no-show with tweets on Twitter. You are then asked to send questions and then get hitched with some PR agency that picks what should reach the big man or woman's ears.</p><p>The Vatican's approach, on the other hand, was refreshing and officials told me the Holy See \"does not buy coverage or set the agenda\" and would be happy if I report the truth however unpalatable it may be. Chris Lamb of</p><p>The Tablet who was with me on the trip advised me to ask him something 'personal'. At that moment I couldn't think of something closer to my heart than the media and the news organisation that I work for.</p><p>So when Francis came towards me and shook my hand, I blurted what came to my mind. I tried to pull it away but he held it for what I thought were an extra 30 seconds - more than the regulation time for a handshake. He looked keen to strike a conversation and spoke in Italian which was translated to say that he was happy to meet me and sought my wishes and prayers for the trip.</p><p>\"He likes speaking to journalists, taking their questions and answering them as best as he can,\" said a fellow scribe as Francis continued his walk down the Alitalia 777's aisle and chatted up the media. For the rest of the flight, we talked about why journalism needs to be accorded more respect by those in power, and why we do not wish to be treated as marketing or PR peddlers. We expressed concerns about journalists being laid off as Facebook and Google continue to gobble up advertising on the Internet. The Press followed the herd and joined the eyeballs game on social media only to see their profits and revenues plummet.</p><p>Now, here's the score that is in favour of Big Tech. The net digital advertising revenues of Google as a percentage of total digital advertising revenues worldwide is predicted to touch 32.5 per cent this year. Facebook's digital ad revenue was 33.84 per cent of the total digital revenues globally in 2018, according to Statista.</p><p>Newspapers and other media like TV, the original news producers, realise (rather late in the day) that the money they invest to produce quality journalism - where you pose tough questions to those in power - is now being peddled for cheap online, or for free. We produce the news, you pay Big Tech. Why? Because they have better technology and e-delivery systems. Which brings me to a recent report in Britain that raises concerns about the sustainability of the news media. Dame Frances Cairncross, who was appointed by the government to probe the issue, warned that the collapse of the news industry could threaten democracies.</p><p>Her report called for an investigation into Facebook and Google's near monopoly over Net ads. Local journalism and small newspapers have gone bust and several journalists have been sacked in many countries. In this scenario, her report suggests direct government funding for public-interest news outlets. The report also sought rules to govern the relationship between publishers and Big Tech. A regulator would ensure Big Tech gives news media due credit (and share revenues) while creating a level playing field.</p><p>Now, let me get back to Pope Francis and the barrage of questions he faced from journalists on the return flight to the Vatican from the UAE. The Pope was grilled about the scandals that have enveloped the Catholic church and answered them all patiently. He said he was ashamed that nuns were abused, and said the guilty would be punished under the law.</p><p>That session gave me some hope about the media profession. Journalists ask tough questions, even to the pope. That's our job. It is also time governments step in to stem the rot on social media in the name of news. Incentives, tax exemptions and support for quality journalism are welcome. And don't forget those prayers for the media. That's me crossing the professional line to get 'personal'.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:-allan@khaleejtimes.com\">-allan@khaleejtimes.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-137538364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDN-DPC1-JDJN-6356-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Some Republicans have suggested using the rarely invoked Congressional Review Act to overturn the neutrality order (CD Dec 22 p5). Goodlatte said he and former U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., pondered legislation more than a decade ago that would have used existing antitrust laws to ensure open access to the Internet. \"It's not a new issue for the committee,\" Goodlatte said. \"We ought to revisit that.\"</p><p>Asked about last summer's aborted cybersecurity legislation in the Senate that would have given the president authority to shut down parts of the Internet if a massive cyberattack were under way, the Virginia Republican said he \"would be very cautious about that.\" \"The so-called 'kill switch' is not a realistic look at how the Internet works,\" Goodlatte said. He also said he wanted to toughen the criminal code so hackers would face stiffer penalties.</p><p>Joining Goodlatte on the dais were White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt and AT&amp;T Senior Vice President and Chief Security Officer Ed Amoroso. Amoroso said cybersecurity leaders should \"raise their game ... pretty quickly\" because hackers have grown increasingly sophisticated. Asked about government's role in cybersecurity, Amoroso reiterated his advice (CD Nov 8 p8) that government use its procurement power to leverage better security: \"The first priority is to manage the government infrastructure better.\" -- Bill Myers</p><p>State of the Net Notebook</p><p>Calling net neutrality a \"poor policy,\" Neil Fried, House Commerce Committee counsel, said the committee plans to challenge the FCC's order by using the Congressional Review Act. There's a procedural window, he said on a State of the Net panel late Tuesday. Once details of the net neutrality rules are released, a 60-day clock will start, he said. Roger Sherman, chief Democratic counsel to the House Communications Subcommittee, said the FCC's order is balanced and takes into consideration interests including those of public interest groups and the industry. He urged regulators to focus on other important issues like spectrum, intercarrier compensation and access revamp. \"Most people are fairly confident that President [Barack] Obama would veto this,\" he said. While the committee wants to move forward with other issues like spectrum, it's not comfortable with the way the FCC uses its authority, Fried said, adding that other priorities like spectrum auctions also involve the commission's authority. The speakers agreed that spectrum is a bipartisan issue. Privacy also is a bipartisan issue, but it will be hard to reach consensus, Fried said. -- YW</p><p>Besides opposing the FCC's net neutrality order, it's unclear what tea party supporters will do about tech issues, participants said on a panel at the State of the Net Conference. \"I think you're dealing with a blank sheet of paper on these issues with the tea party,\" said former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the Republican Main Street Partnership's CEO. The movement grew out of frustration with debt and taxes, and those will provide their political standards, he said. Don't look for big tech bills to pass this Congress, Davis said. \"This is basically spring training for the 2012 presidential election,\" he said. Many tea party leaders come from the South and West and bring the regions' cultural conservatism with them, Davis said. The new House will favor free trade more than the previous one because the tea party's success has reduced the influence of unions, he said. Other predictions: gradual changes to patent law instead of comprehensive overhaul, new privacy protections for children but hands-off consenting adults, and inaction on Internet gambling. The tea partiers will err on the side of less government intervention versus regulation, said former Rep. Rick White, R-Wash., a co-founder of the group. Tea party supporters will follow their political leaders in Congress, he predicted. -- DH</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5205-1W01-JC8G-815G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>COMMUNICATIONS DAILY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>January 19, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

(TSXV: GOOD) (FSE: 4G5) (\"GLN\", or the \"Company\"), a Vancouver-based programmatic advertising technology company, wishes to provide the following corporate update.The Company became aware in August that certain of its key creditors would be unable to pay their outstanding accounts with the Company, which, along with a significant reduction in the day-to-day business drastically impacted the Company's ability to operate. Upon further investigation the Company identified that recent actions by giant tech companies had significantly impacted the sector the Company operates in. </p><p>Their strategy has been to consolidate advertising into a small number of companies, and then use that leverage to switch the traditional balance of power from publishers to the advertisers. The speed and effectiveness in which this shift has taken place shocked the industry and in turn has massively impacted the Company's ability to generate revenue. Secondly, the Company's business partners are now struggling to maintain operations, and clients are at risk of bankruptcy, going out of business and are unable to pay their bills. The links below describe in more detail these actions and effect on the sector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Industry watchdogs have begun to take action and GLN intends to work with the Canada Competition Watchdog who are investigating online \"anti-competitive strategies. Such strategies could include refusing to deal with competitors, [and] prohibiting suppliers from providing rivals with better prices or terms.\" (1). The deadline for submission is November 30th, 2019.The Company also supports and intends to offer assistance in the recently announced anti trust investigation into the giant tech companies who it believes used their scale and influence to bypass the advertising exchange layer of the AdTech ecosystem. (2,3)GLN is continuing to work on the preparation of its second quarter 2019 financial statements. The delay in the filing of these documents is due to substantial reworking of the statements following the material impairment in the business conditions as described above. The reworking of the second quarter financial statements was required once GLN became aware of the significant degradation in business performance and its likely impact on the Company's assets and collectability of the Company's accounts receivable.This shift in the industry landscape has resulted in a major negative impact on the AdTech sector. In response to this shift, the Company is proposing a repositioning of its business. The repositioning strategy proposes utilizing the technology the Company has developed to power customer acquisition for several consumer products and services, including cannabidiol (\"CBD\") products, e-sports fantasy and other on-line gambling services. Redeploying the Company's technology in these new markets will give the GLN a significant customer acquisition advantage and allows the Company to effectively become its own publisher thereby reducing its risk and exposure to a similar catastrophic impact on its business.The Company wishes to thank Stephanie Ratza and Praveen Varshney for their service to the Company and announce their resignations from the board of directors. The Company will seek to replace their board positions with persons directly able to assist the Company's restructuring and redirection of its technology into other markets such as CBD, 'gaming' and e-sports. Due to other commitments and time constraints, Mathew Lee has resigned as Chief Finance Officer (\"CFO\") and is replaced by interim CFO Ying Xu. 1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html</url>[1] 2       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning</url>[2] 3       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/\">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/</url>[3] 4       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html</url>[4] 5       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.5275779\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.5275779</url>[5] 6       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/\">https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/</url>[6]<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investors@glninc.ca[7]\">investors@glninc.ca[7]</email>;Jesse Dylan, Chairman CEO Chris Bradley 604 265 7511Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.Forward Looking Statements:This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (\"forward-looking information\") concerning the Company's business plans, including, but not limited to, anticipated results and developments in the Company's operations in future periods and other matters that may occur in the future.

(TSXV: GOOD) (FSE: 4G5) (\"GLN\", or the \"Company\"), a Vancouver-based programmatic advertising technology company, wishes to provide the following corporate update.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company became aware in August that certain of its key creditors would be unable to pay their outstanding accounts with the Company, which, along with a significant reduction in the day-to-day business drastically impacted the Company's ability to operate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Upon further investigation the Company identified that recent actions by giant tech companies had significantly impacted the sector the Company operates in. Their strategy has been to consolidate advertising into a small number of companies, and then use that leverage to switch the traditional balance of power from publishers to the advertisers. The speed and effectiveness in which this shift has taken place shocked the industry and in turn has massively impacted the Company's ability to generate revenue. Secondly, the Company's business partners are now struggling to maintain operations, and clients are at risk of bankruptcy, going out of business and are unable to pay their bills. The links below describe in more detail these actions and effect on the sector [sup.(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)].</p><p>Industry watchdogs have begun to take action and GLN intends to work with the Canada Competition Watchdog who are investigating online \"anti-competitive strategies. Such strategies could include refusing to deal with competitors, [and] prohibiting suppliers from providing rivals with better prices or terms.\"[sup. (1).] The deadline for submission is November 30th, 2019.</p><p>The Company also supports and intends to offer assistance in the recently announced anti trust investigation into the giant tech companies who it believes used their scale and influence to bypass the advertising exchange layer of the AdTech ecosystem. [sup.(2,3)]</p><p>GLN is continuing to work on the preparation of its second quarter 2019 financial statements. The delay in the filing of these documents is due to substantial reworking of the statements following the material impairment in the business conditions as described above. The reworking of the second quarter financial statements was required once GLN became aware of the significant degradation in business performance and its likely impact on the Company's assets and collectability of the Company's accounts receivable.</p><p>This shift in the industry landscape has resulted in a major negative impact on the AdTech sector. In response to this shift, the Company is proposing a repositioning of its business. The repositioning strategy proposes utilizing the technology the Company has developed to power customer acquisition for several consumer products and services, including cannabidiol (\"CBD\") products, e-sports fantasy and other on-line gambling services. Redeploying the Company's technology in these new markets will give the GLN a significant customer acquisition advantage and allows the Company to effectively become its own publisher thereby reducing its risk and exposure to a similar catastrophic impact on its business.</p><p>The Company wishes to thank Stephanie Ratza and Praveen Varshney for their service to the Company and announce their resignations from the board of directors. The Company will seek to replace their board positions with persons directly able to assist the Company's restructuring and redirection of its technology into other markets such as CBD, 'gaming' and e-sports. Due to other commitments and time constraints, Mathew Lee has resigned as Chief Finance Officer (\"CFO\") and is replaced by interim CFO Ying Xu.</p><p>1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html2\">https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html2</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning3\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning3</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/4\">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/4</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html5\">https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html5</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.52757796\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.52757796</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/\">https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/</url></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investors@glninc.ca\">investors@glninc.ca</email></p><p>Jesse Dylan, ChairmanCEO Chris Bradley604 265 7511</p><p>Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><p>Forward Looking Statements:</p><p>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (\"forward-looking information\") concerning the Company's business plans, including, but not limited to, anticipated results and developments in the Company's operations in future periods and other matters that may occur in the future.

(TSXV: GOOD) (FSE: 4G5) (\"GLN\", or the \"Company\"), a Vancouver-based programmatic advertising technology company, wishes to provide the following corporate update.The Company became aware in August that certain of its key creditors would be unable to pay their outstanding accounts with the Company, which, along with a significant reduction in the day-to-day business drastically impacted the Company's ability to operate. Upon further investigation the Company identified that recent actions by giant tech companies had significantly impacted the sector the Company operates in. </p><p>Their strategy has been to consolidate advertising into a small number of companies, and then use that leverage to switch the traditional balance of power from publishers to the advertisers. The speed and effectiveness in which this shift has taken place shocked the industry and in turn has massively impacted the Company's ability to generate revenue. Secondly, the Company's business partners are now struggling to maintain operations, and clients are at risk of bankruptcy, going out of business and are unable to pay their bills. The links below describe in more detail these actions and effect on the sector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Industry watchdogs have begun to take action and GLN intends to work with the Canada Competition Watchdog who are investigating online \"anti-competitive strategies. Such strategies could include refusing to deal with competitors, [and] prohibiting suppliers from providing rivals with better prices or terms.\" (1). The deadline for submission is November 30th, 2019.The Company also supports and intends to offer assistance in the recently announced anti trust investigation into the giant tech companies who it believes used their scale and influence to bypass the advertising exchange layer of the AdTech ecosystem. (2,3)GLN is continuing to work on the preparation of its second quarter 2019 financial statements. The delay in the filing of these documents is due to substantial reworking of the statements following the material impairment in the business conditions as described above. The reworking of the second quarter financial statements was required once GLN became aware of the significant degradation in business performance and its likely impact on the Company's assets and collectability of the Company's accounts receivable.This shift in the industry landscape has resulted in a major negative impact on the AdTech sector. In response to this shift, the Company is proposing a repositioning of its business. The repositioning strategy proposes utilizing the technology the Company has developed to power customer acquisition for several consumer products and services, including cannabidiol (\"CBD\") products, e-sports fantasy and other on-line gambling services. Redeploying the Company's technology in these new markets will give the GLN a significant customer acquisition advantage and allows the Company to effectively become its own publisher thereby reducing its risk and exposure to a similar catastrophic impact on its business.The Company wishes to thank Stephanie Ratza and Praveen Varshney for their service to the Company and announce their resignations from the board of directors. The Company will seek to replace their board positions with persons directly able to assist the Company's restructuring and redirection of its technology into other markets such as CBD, 'gaming' and e-sports. Due to other commitments and time constraints, Mathew Lee has resigned as Chief Finance Officer (\"CFO\") and is replaced by interim CFO Ying Xu. 1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html</url>[1] 2       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning</url>[2] 3       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/\">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/</url>[3] 4       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html</url>[4] 5       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.5275779\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.5275779</url>[5] 6       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/\">https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/</url>[6]<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investors@glninc.ca[7]\">investors@glninc.ca[7]</email>;Jesse Dylan, Chairman CEO Chris Bradley 604 265 7511Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.Forward Looking Statements:This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (\"forward-looking information\") concerning the Company's business plans, including, but not limited to, anticipated results and developments in the Company's operations in future periods and other matters that may occur in the future.

(TSXV: GOOD) (FSE: 4G5) (\" GLN \", or the \" Company \"), a Vancouver-based programmatic advertising technology company, wishes to provide the following corporate update.The Company became aware in August that certain of its key creditors would be unable to pay their outstanding accounts with the Company, which, along with a significant reduction in the day-to-daybusiness drastically impacted the Company's ability to operate. Upon further investigation the Company identified that recent actions by giant tech companies had significantly impacted the sector the Company operates in. Their strategy has been to consolidate advertising into a small number of companies, and then use that leverage to switch the traditional balance of power from publishers to the advertisers. </p><p>The speed and effectiveness in which this shift has taken place shocked the industry and in turn has massively impacted the Company's ability to generate revenue. Secondly, the Company's business partners are now struggling to maintain operations, and clients are at risk of bankruptcy, going out of business and are unable to pay their bills. The links below describe in more detail these actions and effect on the sector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).Industry watchdogs have begun to take action and GLN intends to work with the Canada Competition Watchdog who are investigating online \"anti-competitive strategies. Such strategies could include refusing to deal with competitors, [and] prohibiting suppliers from providing rivals with better prices or terms.\" (1). The deadline for submission is November 30th, 2019.The Company also supports and intends to offer assistance in the recently announced anti trust investigation into the giant tech companies who it believes used their scale and influence to bypass the advertising exchange layer of the AdTech ecosystem. (2,3)GLN is continuing to work on the preparation of its second quarter 2019 financial statements. The delay in the filing of these documents is due to substantial reworking of the statements following the material impairment in the business conditions as described above. The reworking of the second quarter financial statements was required once GLN became aware of the significant degradation in business performance and its likely impact on the Company's assets and collectability of the Company's accounts receivable.This shift in the industry landscape has resulted in a major negative impact on the AdTech sector. In response to this shift, the Company is proposing a repositioning of its business. The repositioning strategy proposes utilizing the technology the Company has developed to power customer acquisition for several consumer products and services, including cannabidiol (\"CBD\") products, e-sports fantasy and other on-line gambling services. Redeploying the Company's technology in these new markets will give the GLN a significant customer acquisition advantage and allows the Company to effectively become its own publisher thereby reducing its risk and exposure to a similar catastrophic impact on its business.The Company wishes to thank Stephanie Ratza and Praveen Varshney for their service to the Company and announce their resignations from the board of directors. The Company will seek to replace their board positions with persons directly able to assist the Company's restructuring and redirection of its technology into other markets such as CBD, 'gaming' and e-sports. Due to other commitments and time constraints, Mathew Lee has resigned as Chief Finance Officer (\"CFO\") and is replaced by interim CFO Ying Xu.1https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/09/04/watchdog-looks-into-anti-competition-practices-in-the-digital-economy.html<br/>2https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/the-great-break-up-of-big-tech-is-finally-beginning<br/>3https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/03/tech/states-antitrust-investigation-google/<br/>4https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/google-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/index.html<br/>5https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-antitrust-probe-1.5275779<br/>6https://time.com/5672510/state-investigations-google-monopoly/ Jesse Dylan, Chairman<br/>CEO Chris Bradley<br/>604 265 7511Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

All of this is expected to come in a speech that Jeremy Corbyn is giving today at the Edinburgh Festival. He's going to say these big companies make huge profits. He thinks some of that could be given to the BBC to give it a guaranteed income into the future. In that way make it more competitive on the international stage guess thins huge companies who seem to have bottom - these huge companies companies. It raises in excess of #3 billion a year for the BBC but more than 70 years after the first TV Licence was issued Jeremy Corbyn says the system must be brought into the digital age. Large technology companies should be taxed he will say to subsidise the licence fee fee. That would make the BBC more competitive and cheaper for poorer households. We don't need any more taxes in the UK. It is going to stop investment from businesses coming into the country. Jeremy Corbyn has had a touchy relationship with the media. They are continuing to resort to lies and smears. He complained to the press regulator this month about coverage of him at a wrist laying ceremony in Tunisia and today he will say low levels of trust in the media cannot be ignored. The BBC and tech companies haven't responded, but the Conservatives say extra taxes would end up being passed on to consumers. Let's get the rest of the news. Hundreds of thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results today. Headteachers have raised concerns that the new grading system in England could send a demoralising message to students who are likely to score lower results this year. These are the first GCSE results under the tougher system, aren't they? Yes, it really has been a long and anxious summer for thousands of pupils. We will find out in a few moments as some of these guys have done. Pupils in England have had major changes to contend with. GCSEs have changed. The exams are different, designed to be more challenging but the big change is how those exams are graded. Let's remind ourselves how the new system works. A* to G grades have been scrapped altogether and been replaced with a 9 to 1 system, 9 being the highest. A* and A have been replaced by 7, 8 and 9 and a grade 4, it is now the equivalent of the old grade C. But without further ado, let's find out how these pupils have done this morning. Guys, if you want to open those envelopes. You have been incredibly patient this morning. They have arrived here very early. This is the first time they have seen their results under these new GCSEs. I am going to come to you. How have you done? I think I have done really well. Better than I expected. Maths is 9, physics 9. 7 in chemistry. 6 in both Englishes. You are delighted. You are going off to be a professional rugby player. Owen? Pretty well. 9 in maths and physics, 8 in other sciences. Emily, you were worried about your English? I got a 5, that is a strong pass. There we go, just a sample of how some pupils have done here. We will be coming back here a little later on to speak to some of the others while they absorb those results. Well done to those students. People in Hawaii are bracing themselves for the strongest hurricane to hit the islands in a quarter of a century. The hurricane is predicted to bring winds of up to 100mph. Ross King is there for us. The authorities say they are planning for the worst and hoping for the best. Yeah,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITVLON-8ed5e8596414413fb29fc03b0c176a8c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITVLON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3G-GS11-JBH6-C3DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402057</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The weather in the UK dominated by warmth and heat lately, but that is all changing as the jetstream that divides the warm and the cold slipping south, bringing two things, one cooler conditions and also the return of some rain as well. The rain started its life yesterday through many northern areas of the UK. It is slipping south and then cooler air follows on behind. So this morning, here is where the rain has moved to. Yesterday it was in the north, today it is affecting parts of Lincolnshire, Midlands and Westcountry. It will slip its way through East Anglia and the south-east this morning. Brighter skies follow, but you will notice how much cooler it will be behind that. Another spell of rain making its way into northern England and North Wales. Heavy showers here. And behind that, it turns even cooler. feel Heavy blustery showers, an autumnal and temperatures no more mid to high 20s, as we head into the weekend, sunshine, showers and cooler. Thursday 23rd August 2018. Live from ITV Studios in London. This is Good Morning Britain. Good Morning Britain, our main news, a tax on technology giants like Google and Amazonto supplement the TV Licence fee. That is going to be pro-Decembered by the Labour leader in a major speech later. Our chief correspondent is at broadcasting house. The Conservatives are saying that the tech firms would simply pass on the extra costs to their customers, what is the point. We have heard from Labour's deputy leader this morning who says this is just the start of a conversation. It's being described as a digital licence fee.

With 40,000 cases worldwide and a vaccine potentially over a year away, containing the disease looks like a race against time. Communication watchdog Ofcom is to be given the power to make tech firms responsible for protecting people from harmful content such as violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse, the Government is set to announce today. The new rules are likely to apply to Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat amongst others. </p><p>Our Chief Correspondent Richard Gaisford is at Westminster. How has this been received? They have tried to do it themselves. Clearly, the Government doesn't think they are doing a good enough job? No, campaigners who have been pushing for this are asking questions about off questions about Ofcoms ability to take on this policing role and the kind of fines and punishments that will be laid at the door of these big tech firms with billions in the banks if they don't comply. Ofcom of course is an organisation that's currently looking at hundreds of television and radio channels taking public complaints, investigating them, but this is going to magnify its task by thousands of times. Highlighted of course by the really sad case back in 2017 of Molly Russell a 14-year-old girl who took her own life. They described it as a wrecking ball to their family. And the NSPCC say this is good news that we can push ahead with these kind of reforms, but they have to be effective. It is vital we see a regulator that can hold tech firms to account for their failings when it comes to children's safety. We need to see a legally-enforceable duty of care imposed on Facebook, which means they face tough consequences if they compromise on children's safety, so we need to see a regulator that has teeth. Well, we asked Facebook for comment. They have referred us to a statement they gave last year when this was being discussed as a White Paper. It is clear, Ranvir, that what we are starting to see now is an emphasis change. These big tech firms now really moving to the realms of being publishers and not just platformss and in the just platformss and in just platformss and just platformss just platforms and the changes will realms of being publishers and not now be welcome. They need to show they have got teeth. Richard Gaisford at Westminster. Thank you very much. Abroad now: Bernie Sanders has won the New Hampshire Democratic Primary in the US putting him in a strong position to become their next Presidential candidate. Pete Buttigieg came in a close second as former Vice President Joe Biden lagged far behind in results. He was seen leaving New Hampshire ahead of the polls closing. What I can tell you, with absolute certainty - and I know I speak for everyone of the Democratic candidates - we are going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous President in the modern history of this country. A crucial test case will consider whether care workers who provide help at night should be paid for their whole shift not just the hours they're awake. Care workers say it's long overdue but many small organisations say it could bankrupt them. Gargy Patel reports. Leo Andrade is a full-time carer for her autistic 12-year-old son Joshua, her oldest son Stephen needs full-time care in a special home. His severe autism and learning difficulties means his family depend on day and night carers. If a person needs those 24-hour care, those people need to be be paid because they are working. Currently, these carers only get help. paid for the time they are called to The court case is arguing they should get the National Minimum Wage for the whole shift, with backdated payments. It could mean a total pay-out of #400 million. They get paid #20, #30, #40 for 12 hours of work. It seems unacceptable that people would not be paid at least minimum wage. But it is feared smaller organisations would collapse from the increased wage bill and the Government is being urged to step in. If the Government walks away from this, and leaves the sector to pick up the bill, it will have dire consequences with many closures, a lot of people on the front-line being let down, a lot of vulnerable people without a service. The Government says care workers should be fairly rewarded and encourage employers to pay more than the</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITVLON-cfd19f382e794012adecd80f0d11285e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITVLON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-4SB1-DY08-304X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402057</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.
