Keep an eye on this one \u2014 it is a big story that could quickly escalate. The launch of SoftBank\u2019s $108bn Vision Fund II is the big finance theme of the week \u2014 but not all are impressed. Elsewhere, ByteDance is moving into making smartphones. And Syngenta, under Chinese ownership, is looking to boost ag tech to combat climate change.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story </p><p>It risks escalating into the perfect storm. Japan\u2019s decision in early July to tighten controls on exports to South Korea of three rare chemicals essential for making semiconductors and flat panel screens represents an assault on the engine that powers South Korea\u2019s high-tech economy, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Inside-the-lose-lose-trade-fight-between-Japan-and-South-Korea\">Nikkei Asian Review</url>.\u00a0</p><p>The fallout is hitting Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, two of South Korea\u2019s leading chip companies. And some analysts now warn that the global supply chain for tech equipment \u2014 already buffeted by US-China trade tensions \u2014 could be thrown into further disarray.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis> Things may quickly get worse. 1) Tokyo is expected this week to formally strip Seoul of its \u201cwhitelist\u201d status, meaning Japanese companies will need government approval before exporting sensitive materials to South Korea. This may further restrict the machinery and components that South Korea uses for its semiconductor and auto production. 2) Boycotts of Japanese brands and stores in Seoul are under way. 3) A South Korean court in January approved the expropriation of some of Nippon Steel\u2019s equity holdings in the country, related to claims over wartime labour. If the liquidation of such assets is carried out, Japan could retaliate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis> The row\u2019s antecedents lie in the emotional issue of wartime labour. But the biggest impact so far has been on SK Hynix, which says it is planning to cut investment and production due to a mix of adverse market conditions and the Japan-Korea spat. Samsung also warned of uncertainties ahead as the row escalates. Both companies have seen their net profit drop \u2014 by 53 per cent in the case of Samsung and 88 per cent in the case of SK Hynix in the past quarter.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>SoftBank Vision Fund: Chapter 2: The launch of the second fund by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japanese</emphasis> company was more noticeable for what information was missing, rather than for the list of high-profile names backing it.

The company, which was bought for $43bn in 2016 by ChemChina in the largest acquisition ever by a Chinese group, is boosting its R&amp;D budget by 4.5 per cent from $1.3bn last year to spur technological innovation.\u00a0</p><p>One focus will be the challenge of how to feed more people on less land, partly by developing seeds that are more resilient to both droughts and floods.\u00a0</p><p>Another priority is to work with Chinese institutes on gene editing, helping Syngenta become a life sciences platform, said Erik Fyrwald, chief executive, in an interview. One use of this might be to render certain insects harmless through genetic editing, thus reducing the need for pesticides.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read the story here by Henny Sender, the FT\u2019s chief correspondent, international finance.</emphasis></p><p>In the spotlight</p><p>When Carrefour, Europe\u2019s largest retailer, took a decisive step to quit China last month, Suning.com, which bought most of the French company\u2019s business, remained in the background. But the story behind what is now China\u2019s largest bricks-and-mortar retailer is intriguing.\u00a0</p><p>Founded in 1999 by Zhang Jindong, home appliance chain Suning struggled with transitioning its empire to online. By 2009, Mr Zhang realised Suning could no longer ignore online retail. But even after this, the company struggled to gain traction. However, a shift in strategy to fast-moving consumer goods gave rise to the concept of omnichannel retailing, in which online and offline shopping are merged. Now it has won most of Carrefour\u2019s business while an Alibaba partnership has also paid off big time. But can Suning continue to reap dividends as the ecommerce battleground, ironically shifts back to the physical world?</p><p>Check out scoutAsia Research\u2019s deep dive on the rise, fall and rise again of Suning.</p><p>Smart data</p><p>New rules introduced by Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year allowing drug developers to list on the bourse before they sell any products to patients seem to be having the desired effect.

For one thing, he said, the giants use their dominant position to subsidize conquests into other markets, squeezing smaller players, some of which were formerly partners. He had some insight into the matter, given that one-time collaborators Google LLC and Amazon. com Inc. are now both selling aggressively discounted smart speakers years after Sonos pioneered the devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both companies initially gave Sonos their blessing by allowing it to use Google Assistant and Alexa voice controls in its product. But over the years, Spence said, the giants began to engage in more aggressive and bullying behaviour, leaving Sonos no choice but to launch a patent-infringement lawsuit against Google in an attempt to protect itself and its products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Long term, this could mean price increases and prevent new entrants. It also dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next great inventions and bring them to market,\" he told lawmakers. \"Venture-capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms - they stay away from those investments.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just venture capitalists that are wary of the startup kill zone, a snappy way of saying that the world's biggest tech firms are so dominant they can easily crush the competition with predatory tactics, or simply avoid the hassle by buying up any potential threats before they get big enough to become a fullfledged challenger.</p><p>The canonical example of a kill zone is Facebook Inc. buying Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., while also copying key features from Snapchat to prevent those apps from becoming serious competitors. Facebook has made at least 81 acquisitions since obtaining its domain name in 2005, according to Wikipedia.</p><p>But one of the challenges of the kill zone theory is that it can be difficult to observe in the wild unless something big enough happens to make the news, such as when Cisco Systems Inc. bought Waterloo, Ont.-based PixStream Inc. in 2000 (and shut it down a year later) for US$369 million or when Snapchat bought Toronto-based Bitstrips in 2016 for US$100 million.</p><p>What's harder to track are the $50 million, or even $5 million acquisitions that never make the headlines, but take companies out of the market before they're big enough to be relevant.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants say these kinds of acquisitions and predatory tactics happen all the time, but the companies that get picked off are generally much smaller than Instagram or WhatsApp so the kill zone doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.</p><p>Such critics also say anticompetitive behaviour in the technology sector goes beyond pricing - many services from Google and Facebook are free - since the resulting lack of meaningful competition stifles innovation and allows big companies more freedom to build business models around monetizing private information.</p><p>\"(The kill zone) is a real thing,\" Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ incubator at Ryerson University, said. \"And you see it more and more with the challenge of large corporations shopping around all the time, seeing what's available, what's going on.\"</p><p>Snobar sees a lot of nascent tech companies pass through his doors as well as how Big Tech is shaping and often snapping up those fledgling businesses.</p><p>Anti-competitive acquisitions are an issue the Competition Bureau of Canada said it keeps an eye on, and it has recently expanded its market intelligence efforts on this front.</p><p>\"As an organization, the bureau is always concerned about and seeks to identify acquisitions that have the potential to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition (SLPC), including 'killer acquisitions'by large firms of nascent competitors,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"(The bureau's) enhanced intelligence-gathering activities aim to identify transactions that are otherwise not brought to the bureau's attention because they fall below our notification thresholds, but that have the potential to result in an SLPC - including potential 'killer acquisitions.'\" New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, though, has a dim view of the bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"I'd like to actually have a Competition Bureau,\" he said. \"I think there's one in name, and it was probably great in the 1980s, but the world has changed dramatically, and they're outside the conversation.\"</p><p>But with the benefit of a few weeks worth of hindsight, 2019 is beginning to look like a watershed year when governments around the world started to seriously consider whether Big Tech is too big.</p><p>The European Union levied multi-billion-dollar fines against Google, and various government agencies in the United States are engaged in antitrust investigations against Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon - the so-called Gang of Four.</p><p>Angus in April brought up the idea of kill zones at a meeting in Ottawa of the International Grand Committee on Privacy, Big Data and Democracy, which brought together legislators from around the world to study issues associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 - when the British political consultant used the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes - and, more generally, the role of Big Tech in society.</p><p>\"With Amazon, it's the kill zone of competition - the power that you have through all of your platforms to drive down prices and actually put people out of business,\" Angus told Amazon's representative at the meeting.</p><p>But Mark Ryland, a director in the chief information security office at Amazon Web Services, disagrees that competition is being stilted.</p><p>\"There are a lot of new startups, and we even have a great number of competitors who use our Amazon Web Services platform,\" he said. \"Some of the largest online commerce platforms in, say, Germany and Latin America use AWS and trust us with their businesses, so we think competition is working.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs paint a more complicated picture, but essentially say that both Angus and Ryland are right.</p><p>On one hand, there is plenty of competition and opportunity for startups. On the other, the kill zone is all too real.</p><p>Snobar said he occasionally sees the market-distorting power of big tech at the DMZ, as well as opportunistic entrepreneurs looking to profit because of it.</p><p>\"Not everybody wants to build a business that's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"They actually want to sell it to a large corporation. That's part of the plan all along.\"</p><p>Snobar said startup founders sometimes look like they're trying to engineer an acquisition by building capabilities that a larger company will probably need at some future point.</p><p>The kill zone is definitely something startup founders need to be aware of, said Carl Schmidt, co-founder and chief technology officer for Unbounce, a Vancouver-based software company that builds web pages for digital marketing campaigns, but it isn't necessarily a problem for everyone.</p><p>For one thing, Schmidt said, the tech giants create niches for smaller companies. No one would be crazy enough to take on Google by coming up with a better search engine, but its advertising machine creates all kinds of opportunities for companies to build digital marketing tools and complementary services.</p><p>This idea is echoed by Stephen Ufford, chief executive of Trulioo, a Vancouver-based company building a system for verifying identities online. He said his company provides a solution to a big-tech need, adding that entrepreneurs can be complementary to Big Tech in the short term while growing into a disruptive company in the long run.</p><p>\"The kill zone theory is 100-per-cent correct,\" he said. \"But the other side of that coin is that if you're thoughtful about it, you can be strategic in building your business to be an enabler in big tech.\"</p><p>Despite confirming that they feel the effect of kill zones, none of the entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Post wanted to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>After all, there have always been big companies that dominate certain markets.</p><p>\"Every space is crowded, so if you're the kind of person that can't sleep because you have competition in the world, wow, you probably shouldn't be building these things, or you're not building anything that's relevant,\" Ufford said.</p><p>At the Creative Destruction Lab inside the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, chief economist Joshua Gans said the most significant thing they do at the startup incubator is teach entrepreneurs how to navigate the business landscape and build their company in a way that doesn't bring them into a head-on collision with the giants.</p><p>\"There's a thing called a kill zone which is: don't do things that are going to cause you to be crushed immediately. There's nothing new with that,\" he said. \"Don't walk into the lion's den. Maybe take another path.\"</p><p>Gans said the conditions today are really no different than 50 years ago, when an entrepreneur would've been crazy to start a car company to take on Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.</p><p>What's arguably different is that companies such as Google and Amazon are sprawling into so many different aspects of the economy, whereas the car companies generally stayed in their lanes.</p><p>For example, Google is dominant in search and advertising, but also in video hosting through YouTube and mobile phones through Android, not to mention maps, documents and email. Amazon has repeatedly been accused of predatory tactics in everything from shoes to smart-home gadgets.</p><p>But Gans said governments can already police those abuses through antitrust law and regulations to foster a better competitive environment, so it's not necessary to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Another reason some entrepreneurs aren't worried is that, unlike the dominant players in other industries, the current titans of tech are relatively young, and nobody assumes they'll last forever. Facebook could turn into the next MySpace someday.</p><p>There is so much change happening because of cloud computing, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies that there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to start a new company.</p><p>Schmidt said the startup kill zones around Google might mean that nobody is trying to compete to build a better search algorithm, but that's not really hurting startups. Mostly, he said, the lack of competition is a problem for the businesses who need to pay the so-called \"Google tax\" to buy an ad to make sure their company is at the top of search results.</p><p>\"It seems like those areas are more problematic currently than the impact on the startup space, because there is so much new technology and opportunity that we, as entrepreneurs, can easily choose to pursue those areas that are well outside of these kill zones.\"</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

He had some insight into the matter, given that one-time collaborators Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc. are now both selling aggressively discounted smart speakers years after Sonos pioneered the devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both companies initially gave Sonos their blessing by allowing it to use Google Assistant and Alexa voice controls in its product.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But over the years, Spence said, the giants began to engage in more aggressive and bullying behaviour, leaving Sonos no choice but to launch a patent-infringement lawsuit against Google in an attempt to protect itself and its products.</p><p>\"Long term, this could mean price increases and prevent new entrants. It also dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next great inventions and bring them to market,\" he told lawmakers. \"Venture-capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms - they stay away from those investments.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just venture capitalists that are wary of the startup kill zone, a snappy way of saying that the world's biggest tech firms are so dominant they can easily crush the competition with predatory tactics, or simply avoid the hassle by buying up any potential threats before they get big enough to become a full-fledged challenger.</p><p>The canonical example of a kill zone is Facebook Inc. buying Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., while also copying key features from Snapchat to prevent those apps from becoming serious competitors.</p><p>Facebook has made at least 81 acquisitions since obtaining its domain name in 2005, according to Wikipedia.</p><p>But one of the challenges of the kill zone theory is that it can be difficult to observe in the wild unless something big enough happens to make the news, such as when Cisco Systems Inc. bought Waterloo, Ont.-based PixStream Inc. in 2000 (and shut it down a year later) for US$369 million or when Snapchat bought Toronto-based Bitstrips in 2016 for US$100 million.</p><p>What's harder to track are the $50-million, or even $5-million acquisitions that never make the headlines, but take companies out of the market before they're big enough to be relevant.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants say these kinds of acquisitions and predatory tactics happen all the time, but the companies that get picked off are generally much smaller than Instagram or WhatsApp so the kill zone doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.</p><p>Such critics also say anticompetitive behaviour in the technology sector goes beyond pricing - many services from Google and Facebook are free - since the resulting lack of meaningful competition stifles innovation and allows big companies more freedom to build business models around monetizing private information.</p><p>\"(The kill zone) is a real thing,\" said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ incubator at Ryerson University. \"And you see it more and more with the challenge of large corporations shopping around all the time, seeing what's available, what's going on.\"</p><p>Snobar sees a lot of nascent tech companies pass through his doors as well as how Big Tech is shaping and often snapping up those fledgling businesses.</p><p>Anti-competitive acquisitions are an issue the Competition Bureau of Canada said it keeps an eye on, and it has recently expanded its market intelligence efforts on this front.</p><p>\"As an organization, the bureau is always concerned about and seeks to identify acquisitions that have the potential to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition (SLPC), including 'killer acquisitions'by large firms of nascent competitors,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"(The bureau's) enhanced intelligence-gathering activities aim to identify transactions that are otherwise not brought to the bureau's attention because they fall below our notification thresholds, but that have the potential to result in an SLPC - including potential 'killer acquisitions.'\" New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, though, has a dim view of the bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"I'd like to actually have a Competition Bureau,\" he said. \"I think there's one in name, and it was probably great in the 1980s, but the world has changed dramatically, and they're outside the conversation.\"</p><p>But with the benefit of a few weeks'worth of hindsight, 2019 is beginning to look like a watershed year when governments around the world started to seriously consider whether Big Tech is too big.</p><p>The European Union levied multi-billion-dollar fines against Google, and various government agencies in the United States are engaged in antitrust investigations against Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon - the so-called Gang of Four.</p><p>Angus in April brought up the idea of kill zones at a meeting in Ottawa of the International Grand Committee on Privacy, Big Data and Democracy, which brought together legislators from around the world to study issues associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 - when the British political consultant used the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes - and, more generally, the role of Big Tech in society.</p><p>\"With Amazon, it's the kill zone of competition - the power that you have through all of your platforms to drive down prices and actually put people out of business,\" Angus told Amazon's representative at the meeting.</p><p>But Mark Ryland, a director in the chief information security office at Amazon Web Services, disagrees that competition is being stilted.</p><p>\"There are a lot of new startups, and we even have a great number of competitors who use our Amazon Web Services platform,\" he said. \"Some of the largest online commerce platforms in, say, Germany and Latin America use AWS and trust us with their businesses, so we think competition is working.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs paint a more complicated picture, but essentially say that both Angus and Ryland are right.</p><p>On one hand, there is plenty of competition and opportunity for startups. On the other, the kill zone is all too real.</p><p>Snobar said he occasionally sees the market-distorting power of big tech at the DMZ, as well as opportunistic entrepreneurs looking to profit because of it.</p><p>\"Not everybody wants to build a business that's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"They actually want to sell it to a large corporation. That's part of the plan all along.\"</p><p>Snobar said startup founders sometimes look like they're trying to engineer an acquisition by building capabilities that a larger company will probably need at some future point.</p><p>The kill zone is definitely something startup founders need to be aware of, said Carl Schmidt, co-founder and chief technology officer for Unbounce, a Vancouver-based software company that builds web pages for digital marketing campaigns, but it isn't necessarily a problem for everyone.</p><p>For one thing, Schmidt said, the tech giants create niches for smaller companies. No one would be crazy enough to take on Google by coming up with a better search engine, but its advertising machine creates all kinds of opportunities for companies to build digital marketing tools and complementary services.</p><p>This idea is echoed by Stephen Ufford, chief executive of Trulioo, a Vancouver-based company building a system for verifying identities online. He said his company provides a solution to a big-tech need, adding that entrepreneurs can be complementary to Big Tech in the short term while growing into a disruptive company in the long run.</p><p>\"The kill zone theory is 100-percent correct,\" he said. \"But the other side of that coin is that if you're thoughtful about it, you can be strategic in building your business to be an enabler in big tech.\"</p><p>Despite confirming that they feel the effect of kill zones, none of the entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Post wanted to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>After all, there have always been big companies that dominate certain markets.</p><p>\"Every space is crowded, so if you're the kind of person that can't sleep because you have competition in the world, wow, you probably shouldn't be building these things, or you're not building anything that's relevant,\" Ufford said.</p><p>At the Creative Destruction Lab inside the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, chief economist Joshua Gans said the most significant thing they do at the startup incubator is teach entrepreneurs how to navigate the business landscape and build their company in a way that doesn't bring them into a head-on collision with the giants.</p><p>\"There's a thing called a kill zone which is, don't do things that are going to cause you to be crushed immediately. There's nothing new with that,\" he said. \"Don't walk into the lion's den. Maybe take another path.\"</p><p>Gans said the conditions today are really no different than 50 years ago, when an entrepreneur would've been crazy to start a car company to take on Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.</p><p>What's arguably different is that companies such as Google and Amazon are sprawling into so many different aspects of the economy, whereas the car companies generally stayed in their lanes.</p><p>For example, Google is dominant in search and advertising, but also in video hosting through YouTube and mobile phones through Android, not to mention maps, documents and email.</p><p>Amazon has repeatedly been accused of predatory tactics in everything from shoes to smarthome gadgets.</p><p>But Gans said governments can already police those abuses through antitrust law and regulations to foster a better competitive environment, so it's not necessary to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Another reason some entrepreneurs aren't worried is that, unlike the dominant players in other industries, the current titans of tech are relatively young, and nobody assumes they'll last forever. Facebook could turn into the next Myspace someday.</p><p>There is so much change happening because of cloud computing, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies that there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to start a new company.</p><p>Schmidt said the startup kill zones around Google might mean that nobody is trying to compete to build a better search algorithm, but that's not really hurting startups.</p><p>Mostly, he said, the lack of competition is a problem for the businesses who need to pay the socalled \"Google tax\" to buy an ad to make sure their company is at the top of search results.</p><p>\"It seems like those areas are more problematic currently than the impact on the startup space, because there is so much new technology and opportunity that we, as entrepreneurs, can easily choose to pursue those areas that are well outside of these kill zones.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

He had some insight into the matter, given that one-time collaborators Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc. are now both selling aggressively discounted smart speakers years after Sonos pioneered the devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both companies initially gave Sonos their blessing by allowing it to use Google Assistant and Alexa voice controls in its product.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But over the years, Spence said, the giants began to engage in more aggressive and bullying behaviour, leaving Sonos no choice but to launch a patent-infringement lawsuit against Google in an attempt to protect itself and its products.</p><p>\"Long term, this could mean price increases and prevent new entrants. It also dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next great inventions and bring them to market,\" he told lawmakers. \"Venture-capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms - they stay away from those investments.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just venture capitalists that are wary of the startup kill zone, a snappy way of saying that the world's biggest tech firms are so dominant they can easily crush the competition with predatory tactics, or simply avoid the hassle by buying up any potential threats before they get big enough to become a full-fledged challenger.</p><p>The canonical example of a kill zone is Facebook Inc. buying Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., while also copying key features from Snapchat to prevent those apps from becoming serious competitors.</p><p>Facebook has made at least 81 acquisitions since obtaining its domain name in 2005, according to Wikipedia.</p><p>But one of the challenges of the kill zone theory is that it can be difficult to observe in the wild unless something big enough happens to make the news, such as when Cisco Systems Inc. bought Waterloo, Ont.-based PixStream Inc. in 2000 (and shut it down a year later) for US$369 million or when Snapchat bought Toronto-based Bitstrips in 2016 for US$100 million.</p><p>What's harder to track are the $50-million, or even $5-million acquisitions that never make the headlines, but take companies out of the market before they're big enough to be relevant.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants say these kinds of acquisitions and predatory tactics happen all the time, but the companies that get picked off are generally much smaller than Instagram or WhatsApp so the kill zone doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.</p><p>Such critics also say anticompetitive behaviour in the technology sector goes beyond pricing - many services from Google and Facebook are free - since the resulting lack of meaningful competition stifles innovation and allows big companies more freedom to build business models around monetizing private information.</p><p>\"(The kill zone) is a real thing,\" said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ incubator at Ryerson University. \"And you see it more and more with the challenge of large corporations shopping around all the time, seeing what's available, what's going on.\"</p><p>Snobar sees a lot of nascent tech companies pass through his doors as well as how Big Tech is shaping and often snapping up those fledgling businesses.</p><p>Anti-competitive acquisitions are an issue the Competition Bureau of Canada said it keeps an eye on, and it has recently expanded its market intelligence efforts on this front.</p><p>\"As an organization, the bureau is always concerned about and seeks to identify acquisitions that have the potential to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition (SLPC), including 'killer acquisitions'by large firms of nascent competitors,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"(The bureau's) enhanced intelligence-gathering activities aim to identify transactions that are otherwise not brought to the bureau's attention because they fall below our notification thresholds, but that have the potential to result in an SLPC - including potential 'killer acquisitions.'\" New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, though, has a dim view of the bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"I'd like to actually have a Competition Bureau,\" he said. \"I think there's one in name, and it was probably great in the 1980s, but the world has changed dramatically, and they're outside the conversation.\"</p><p>But with the benefit of a few weeks'worth of hindsight, 2019 is beginning to look like a watershed year when governments around the world started to seriously consider whether Big Tech is too big.</p><p>The European Union levied multi-billion-dollar fines against Google, and various government agencies in the United States are engaged in antitrust investigations against Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon - the so-called Gang of Four.</p><p>Angus in April brought up the idea of kill zones at a meeting in Ottawa of the International Grand Committee on Privacy, Big Data and Democracy, which brought together legislators from around the world to study issues associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 - when the British political consultant used the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes - and, more generally, the role of Big Tech in society.</p><p>\"With Amazon, it's the kill zone of competition - the power that you have through all of your platforms to drive down prices and actually put people out of business,\" Angus told Amazon's representative at the meeting.</p><p>But Mark Ryland, a director in the chief information security office at Amazon Web Services, disagrees that competition is being stilted.</p><p>\"There are a lot of new startups, and we even have a great number of competitors who use our Amazon Web Services platform,\" he said. \"Some of the largest online commerce platforms in, say, Germany and Latin America use AWS and trust us with their businesses, so we think competition is working.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs paint a more complicated picture, but essentially say that both Angus and Ryland are right.</p><p>On one hand, there is plenty of competition and opportunity for startups. On the other, the kill zone is all too real.</p><p>Snobar said he occasionally sees the market-distorting power of big tech at the DMZ, as well as opportunistic entrepreneurs looking to profit because of it.</p><p>\"Not everybody wants to build a business that's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"They actually want to sell it to a large corporation. That's part of the plan all along.\"</p><p>Snobar said startup founders sometimes look like they're trying to engineer an acquisition by building capabilities that a larger company will probably need at some future point.</p><p>The kill zone is definitely something startup founders need to be aware of, said Carl Schmidt, co-founder and chief technology officer for Unbounce, a Vancouver-based software company that builds web pages for digital marketing campaigns, but it isn't necessarily a problem for everyone.</p><p>For one thing, Schmidt said, the tech giants create niches for smaller companies. No one would be crazy enough to take on Google by coming up with a better search engine, but its advertising machine creates all kinds of opportunities for companies to build digital marketing tools and complementary services.</p><p>This idea is echoed by Stephen Ufford, chief executive of Trulioo, a Vancouver-based company building a system for verifying identities online. He said his company provides a solution to a big-tech need, adding that entrepreneurs can be complementary to Big Tech in the short term while growing into a disruptive company in the long run.</p><p>\"The kill zone theory is 100-percent correct,\" he said. \"But the other side of that coin is that if you're thoughtful about it, you can be strategic in building your business to be an enabler in big tech.\"</p><p>Despite confirming that they feel the effect of kill zones, none of the entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Post wanted to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>After all, there have always been big companies that dominate certain markets.</p><p>\"Every space is crowded, so if you're the kind of person that can't sleep because you have competition in the world, wow, you probably shouldn't be building these things, or you're not building anything that's relevant,\" Ufford said.</p><p>At the Creative Destruction Lab inside the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, chief economist Joshua Gans said the most significant thing they do at the startup incubator is teach entrepreneurs how to navigate the business landscape and build their company in a way that doesn't bring them into a head-on collision with the giants.</p><p>\"There's a thing called a kill zone which is, don't do things that are going to cause you to be crushed immediately. There's nothing new with that,\" he said. \"Don't walk into the lion's den. Maybe take another path.\"</p><p>Gans said the conditions today are really no different than 50 years ago, when an entrepreneur would've been crazy to start a car company to take on Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.</p><p>What's arguably different is that companies such as Google and Amazon are sprawling into so many different aspects of the economy, whereas the car companies generally stayed in their lanes.</p><p>For example, Google is dominant in search and advertising, but also in video hosting through YouTube and mobile phones through Android, not to mention maps, documents and email.</p><p>Amazon has repeatedly been accused of predatory tactics in everything from shoes to smarthome gadgets.</p><p>But Gans said governments can already police those abuses through antitrust law and regulations to foster a better competitive environment, so it's not necessary to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Another reason some entrepreneurs aren't worried is that, unlike the dominant players in other industries, the current titans of tech are relatively young, and nobody assumes they'll last forever. Facebook could turn into the next Myspace someday.</p><p>There is so much change happening because of cloud computing, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies that there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to start a new company.</p><p>Schmidt said the startup kill zones around Google might mean that nobody is trying to compete to build a better search algorithm, but that's not really hurting startups.</p><p>Mostly, he said, the lack of competition is a problem for the businesses who need to pay the socalled \"Google tax\" to buy an ad to make sure their company is at the top of search results.</p><p>\"It seems like those areas are more problematic currently than the impact on the startup space, because there is so much new technology and opportunity that we, as entrepreneurs, can easily choose to pursue those areas that are well outside of these kill zones.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

He had some insight into the matter, given that one-time collaborators Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc. are now both selling aggressively discounted smart speakers years after Sonos pioneered the devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both companies initially gave Sonos their blessing by allowing it to use Google Assistant and Alexa voice controls in its product.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But over the years, Spence said, the giants began to engage in more aggressive and bullying behaviour, leaving Sonos no choice but to launch a patent-infringement lawsuit against Google in an attempt to protect itself and its products.</p><p>\"Long term, this could mean price increases and prevent new entrants. It also dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next great inventions and bring them to market,\" he told lawmakers. \"Venture-capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms - they stay away from those investments.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just venture capitalists that are wary of the startup kill zone, a snappy way of saying that the world's biggest tech firms are so dominant they can easily crush the competition with predatory tactics, or simply avoid the hassle by buying up any potential threats before they get big enough to become a full-fledged challenger.</p><p>The canonical example of a kill zone is Facebook Inc. buying Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., while also copying key features from Snapchat to prevent those apps from becoming serious competitors.</p><p>Facebook has made at least 81 acquisitions since obtaining its domain name in 2005, according to Wikipedia.</p><p>But one of the challenges of the kill zone theory is that it can be difficult to observe in the wild unless something big enough happens to make the news, such as when Cisco Systems Inc. bought Waterloo, Ont.-based PixStream Inc. in 2000 (and shut it down a year later) for US$369 million or when Snapchat bought Toronto-based Bitstrips in 2016 for US$100 million.</p><p>What's harder to track are the $50-million, or even $5-million acquisitions that never make the headlines, but take companies out of the market before they're big enough to be relevant.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants say these kinds of acquisitions and predatory tactics happen all the time, but the companies that get picked off are generally much smaller than Instagram or WhatsApp so the kill zone doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.</p><p>Such critics also say anticompetitive behaviour in the technology sector goes beyond pricing - many services from Google and Facebook are free - since the resulting lack of meaningful competition stifles innovation and allows big companies more freedom to build business models around monetizing private information.</p><p>\"(The kill zone) is a real thing,\" said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ incubator at Ryerson University. \"And you see it more and more with the challenge of large corporations shopping around all the time, seeing what's available, what's going on.\"</p><p>Snobar sees a lot of nascent tech companies pass through his doors as well as how Big Tech is shaping and often snapping up those fledgling businesses.</p><p>Anti-competitive acquisitions are an issue the Competition Bureau of Canada said it keeps an eye on, and it has recently expanded its market intelligence efforts on this front.</p><p>\"As an organization, the bureau is always concerned about and seeks to identify acquisitions that have the potential to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition (SLPC), including 'killer acquisitions'by large firms of nascent competitors,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"(The bureau's) enhanced intelligence-gathering activities aim to identify transactions that are otherwise not brought to the bureau's attention because they fall below our notification thresholds, but that have the potential to result in an SLPC - including potential 'killer acquisitions.'\" New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, though, has a dim view of the bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"I'd like to actually have a Competition Bureau,\" he said. \"I think there's one in name, and it was probably great in the 1980s, but the world has changed dramatically, and they're outside the conversation.\"</p><p>But with the benefit of a few weeks'worth of hindsight, 2019 is beginning to look like a watershed year when governments around the world started to seriously consider whether Big Tech is too big.</p><p>The European Union levied multi-billion-dollar fines against Google, and various government agencies in the United States are engaged in antitrust investigations against Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon - the so-called Gang of Four.</p><p>Angus in April brought up the idea of kill zones at a meeting in Ottawa of the International Grand Committee on Privacy, Big Data and Democracy, which brought together legislators from around the world to study issues associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 - when the British political consultant used the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes - and, more generally, the role of Big Tech in society.</p><p>\"With Amazon, it's the kill zone of competition - the power that you have through all of your platforms to drive down prices and actually put people out of business,\" Angus told Amazon's representative at the meeting.</p><p>But Mark Ryland, a director in the chief information security office at Amazon Web Services, disagrees that competition is being stilted.</p><p>\"There are a lot of new startups, and we even have a great number of competitors who use our Amazon Web Services platform,\" he said. \"Some of the largest online commerce platforms in, say, Germany and Latin America use AWS and trust us with their businesses, so we think competition is working.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs paint a more complicated picture, but essentially say that both Angus and Ryland are right.</p><p>On one hand, there is plenty of competition and opportunity for startups. On the other, the kill zone is all too real.</p><p>Snobar said he occasionally sees the market-distorting power of big tech at the DMZ, as well as opportunistic entrepreneurs looking to profit because of it.</p><p>\"Not everybody wants to build a business that's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"They actually want to sell it to a large corporation. That's part of the plan all along.\"</p><p>Snobar said startup founders sometimes look like they're trying to engineer an acquisition by building capabilities that a larger company will probably need at some future point.</p><p>The kill zone is definitely something startup founders need to be aware of, said Carl Schmidt, co-founder and chief technology officer for Unbounce, a Vancouver-based software company that builds web pages for digital marketing campaigns, but it isn't necessarily a problem for everyone.</p><p>For one thing, Schmidt said, the tech giants create niches for smaller companies. No one would be crazy enough to take on Google by coming up with a better search engine, but its advertising machine creates all kinds of opportunities for companies to build digital marketing tools and complementary services.</p><p>This idea is echoed by Stephen Ufford, chief executive of Trulioo, a Vancouver-based company building a system for verifying identities online. He said his company provides a solution to a big-tech need, adding that entrepreneurs can be complementary to Big Tech in the short term while growing into a disruptive company in the long run.</p><p>\"The kill zone theory is 100-percent correct,\" he said. \"But the other side of that coin is that if you're thoughtful about it, you can be strategic in building your business to be an enabler in big tech.\"</p><p>Despite confirming that they feel the effect of kill zones, none of the entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Post wanted to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>After all, there have always been big companies that dominate certain markets.</p><p>\"Every space is crowded, so if you're the kind of person that can't sleep because you have competition in the world, wow, you probably shouldn't be building these things, or you're not building anything that's relevant,\" Ufford said.</p><p>At the Creative Destruction Lab inside the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, chief economist Joshua Gans said the most significant thing they do at the startup incubator is teach entrepreneurs how to navigate the business landscape and build their company in a way that doesn't bring them into a head-on collision with the giants.</p><p>\"There's a thing called a kill zone which is, don't do things that are going to cause you to be crushed immediately. There's nothing new with that,\" he said. \"Don't walk into the lion's den. Maybe take another path.\"</p><p>Gans said the conditions today are really no different than 50 years ago, when an entrepreneur would've been crazy to start a car company to take on Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.</p><p>What's arguably different is that companies such as Google and Amazon are sprawling into so many different aspects of the economy, whereas the car companies generally stayed in their lanes.</p><p>For example, Google is dominant in search and advertising, but also in video hosting through YouTube and mobile phones through Android, not to mention maps, documents and email.</p><p>Amazon has repeatedly been accused of predatory tactics in everything from shoes to smarthome gadgets.</p><p>But Gans said governments can already police those abuses through antitrust law and regulations to foster a better competitive environment, so it's not necessary to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Another reason some entrepreneurs aren't worried is that, unlike the dominant players in other industries, the current titans of tech are relatively young, and nobody assumes they'll last forever. Facebook could turn into the next Myspace someday.</p><p>There is so much change happening because of cloud computing, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies that there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to start a new company.</p><p>Schmidt said the startup kill zones around Google might mean that nobody is trying to compete to build a better search algorithm, but that's not really hurting startups.</p><p>Mostly, he said, the lack of competition is a problem for the businesses who need to pay the socalled \"Google tax\" to buy an ad to make sure their company is at the top of search results.</p><p>\"It seems like those areas are more problematic currently than the impact on the startup space, because there is so much new technology and opportunity that we, as entrepreneurs, can easily choose to pursue those areas that are well outside of these kill zones.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

He had some insight into the matter, given that one-time collaborators Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc. are now both selling aggressively discounted smart speakers years after Sonos pioneered the devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both companies initially gave Sonos their blessing by allowing it to use Google Assistant and Alexa voice controls in its product.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But over the years, Spence said, the giants began to engage in more aggressive and bullying behaviour, leaving Sonos no choice but to launch a patent-infringement lawsuit against Google in an attempt to protect itself and its products.</p><p>\"Long term, this could mean price increases and prevent new entrants. It also dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next great inventions and bring them to market,\" he told lawmakers. \"Venture-capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms - they stay away from those investments.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just venture capitalists that are wary of the startup kill zone, a snappy way of saying that the world's biggest tech firms are so dominant they can easily crush the competition with predatory tactics, or simply avoid the hassle by buying up any potential threats before they get big enough to become a full-fledged challenger.</p><p>The canonical example of a kill zone is Facebook Inc. buying Instagram and WhatsApp Inc., while also copying key features from Snapchat to prevent those apps from becoming serious competitors.</p><p>Facebook has made at least 81 acquisitions since obtaining its domain name in 2005, according to Wikipedia.</p><p>But one of the challenges of the kill zone theory is that it can be difficult to observe in the wild unless something big enough happens to make the news, such as when Cisco Systems Inc. bought Waterloo, Ont.-based PixStream Inc. in 2000 (and shut it down a year later) for US$369 million or when Snapchat bought Toronto-based Bitstrips in 2016 for US$100 million.</p><p>What's harder to track are the $50-million, or even $5-million acquisitions that never make the headlines, but take companies out of the market before they're big enough to be relevant.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants say these kinds of acquisitions and predatory tactics happen all the time, but the companies that get picked off are generally much smaller than Instagram or WhatsApp so the kill zone doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.</p><p>Such critics also say anticompetitive behaviour in the technology sector goes beyond pricing - many services from Google and Facebook are free - since the resulting lack of meaningful competition stifles innovation and allows big companies more freedom to build business models around monetizing private information.</p><p>\"(The kill zone) is a real thing,\" said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ incubator at Ryerson University. \"And you see it more and more with the challenge of large corporations shopping around all the time, seeing what's available, what's going on.\"</p><p>Snobar sees a lot of nascent tech companies pass through his doors as well as how Big Tech is shaping and often snapping up those fledgling businesses.</p><p>Anti-competitive acquisitions are an issue the Competition Bureau of Canada said it keeps an eye on, and it has recently expanded its market intelligence efforts on this front.</p><p>\"As an organization, the bureau is always concerned about and seeks to identify acquisitions that have the potential to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition (SLPC), including 'killer acquisitions'by large firms of nascent competitors,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"(The bureau's) enhanced intelligence-gathering activities aim to identify transactions that are otherwise not brought to the bureau's attention because they fall below our notification thresholds, but that have the potential to result in an SLPC - including potential 'killer acquisitions.'\" New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, though, has a dim view of the bureau's efforts.</p><p>\"I'd like to actually have a Competition Bureau,\" he said. \"I think there's one in name, and it was probably great in the 1980s, but the world has changed dramatically, and they're outside the conversation.\"</p><p>But with the benefit of a few weeks'worth of hindsight, 2019 is beginning to look like a watershed year when governments around the world started to seriously consider whether Big Tech is too big.</p><p>The European Union levied multi-billion-dollar fines against Google, and various government agencies in the United States are engaged in antitrust investigations against Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and Amazon - the so-called Gang of Four.</p><p>Angus in April brought up the idea of kill zones at a meeting in Ottawa of the International Grand Committee on Privacy, Big Data and Democracy, which brought together legislators from around the world to study issues associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 - when the British political consultant used the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes - and, more generally, the role of Big Tech in society.</p><p>\"With Amazon, it's the kill zone of competition - the power that you have through all of your platforms to drive down prices and actually put people out of business,\" Angus told Amazon's representative at the meeting.</p><p>But Mark Ryland, a director in the chief information security office at Amazon Web Services, disagrees that competition is being stilted.</p><p>\"There are a lot of new startups, and we even have a great number of competitors who use our Amazon Web Services platform,\" he said. \"Some of the largest online commerce platforms in, say, Germany and Latin America use AWS and trust us with their businesses, so we think competition is working.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs paint a more complicated picture, but essentially say that both Angus and Ryland are right.</p><p>On one hand, there is plenty of competition and opportunity for startups. On the other, the kill zone is all too real.</p><p>Snobar said he occasionally sees the market-distorting power of big tech at the DMZ, as well as opportunistic entrepreneurs looking to profit because of it.</p><p>\"Not everybody wants to build a business that's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"They actually want to sell it to a large corporation. That's part of the plan all along.\"</p><p>Snobar said startup founders sometimes look like they're trying to engineer an acquisition by building capabilities that a larger company will probably need at some future point.</p><p>The kill zone is definitely something startup founders need to be aware of, said Carl Schmidt, co-founder and chief technology officer for Unbounce, a Vancouver-based software company that builds web pages for digital marketing campaigns, but it isn't necessarily a problem for everyone.</p><p>For one thing, Schmidt said, the tech giants create niches for smaller companies. No one would be crazy enough to take on Google by coming up with a better search engine, but its advertising machine creates all kinds of opportunities for companies to build digital marketing tools and complementary services.</p><p>This idea is echoed by Stephen Ufford, chief executive of Trulioo, a Vancouver-based company building a system for verifying identities online. He said his company provides a solution to a big-tech need, adding that entrepreneurs can be complementary to Big Tech in the short term while growing into a disruptive company in the long run.</p><p>\"The kill zone theory is 100-percent correct,\" he said. \"But the other side of that coin is that if you're thoughtful about it, you can be strategic in building your business to be an enabler in big tech.\"</p><p>Despite confirming that they feel the effect of kill zones, none of the entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Post wanted to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>After all, there have always been big companies that dominate certain markets.</p><p>\"Every space is crowded, so if you're the kind of person that can't sleep because you have competition in the world, wow, you probably shouldn't be building these things, or you're not building anything that's relevant,\" Ufford said.</p><p>At the Creative Destruction Lab inside the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, chief economist Joshua Gans said the most significant thing they do at the startup incubator is teach entrepreneurs how to navigate the business landscape and build their company in a way that doesn't bring them into a head-on collision with the giants.</p><p>\"There's a thing called a kill zone which is, don't do things that are going to cause you to be crushed immediately. There's nothing new with that,\" he said. \"Don't walk into the lion's den. Maybe take another path.\"</p><p>Gans said the conditions today are really no different than 50 years ago, when an entrepreneur would've been crazy to start a car company to take on Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.</p><p>What's arguably different is that companies such as Google and Amazon are sprawling into so many different aspects of the economy, whereas the car companies generally stayed in their lanes.</p><p>For example, Google is dominant in search and advertising, but also in video hosting through YouTube and mobile phones through Android, not to mention maps, documents and email.</p><p>Amazon has repeatedly been accused of predatory tactics in everything from shoes to smarthome gadgets.</p><p>But Gans said governments can already police those abuses through antitrust law and regulations to foster a better competitive environment, so it's not necessary to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Another reason some entrepreneurs aren't worried is that, unlike the dominant players in other industries, the current titans of tech are relatively young, and nobody assumes they'll last forever. Facebook could turn into the next Myspace someday.</p><p>There is so much change happening because of cloud computing, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies that there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs who want to start a new company.</p><p>Schmidt said the startup kill zones around Google might mean that nobody is trying to compete to build a better search algorithm, but that's not really hurting startups.</p><p>Mostly, he said, the lack of competition is a problem for the businesses who need to pay the socalled \"Google tax\" to buy an ad to make sure their company is at the top of search results.</p><p>\"It seems like those areas are more problematic currently than the impact on the startup space, because there is so much new technology and opportunity that we, as entrepreneurs, can easily choose to pursue those areas that are well outside of these kill zones.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The best books on the topic this year accept and address that reality.'  The same could be said for the Current Events ...blic Affairs category, but in reverse. The five books in the category all concern themselves with how big business, specifically big tech, is changing the way we live and work\u2014and creating an entirely new set of social issues that we need to address. </p><p> The ethos of Silicon Valley has always been about changing the world, and it is doing so in both very public and profoundly personal ways. Unfortunately, rather than the digital, democratic utopia that was envisioned, it has spiraled into a pseudo-libertarian, faux meritocracy that not only perpetuates many of society's inequalities and ills, but pushes them to new extremes. Rather than a proliferation of smaller-scale businesses being enabled by a lower barrier to entry, business consolidation and economic inequality have risen dramatically. Rather than letting us work from wherever and however we want to, it has shredded the social contract between employers and employees established in the previous century. Rather than leveling out the playing field for women and people of color, the heart of tech is overwhelmingly white and male\u2014and decidedly not because white males have a greater understanding and empathy more with the world and what it needs, and it's not because they are the most talented programmers. In fact, as we'll see, the field of computer programming was pioneered by women. Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley[1] by Emily Chang, Portfolio As most of the professional world has made (albeit very slow and imperfect) progress in gender inequality over the last three decades, Silicon Valley has only gotten worse in that regard. In fact, computer programming, a field invented by and once so dominated by women that a 1967 Cosmopolitan article touted it as ideal 'women's work,' the trend has gone dramatically in reverse.  Emily Chang provides that backstory and brings us up to date in her book Brotopia[2]. 'In the 1840s,' she tells us, 'a woman and brilliant mathematician named Ada Lovelace wrote the first program for a computer that had yet to be built. A century later, women were among the pioneers who worked on the first computing devices for the military during World War II.' Women did the computing that landed us on the moon, programmed the first computer requisitioned by the U.S. Army, and the computer that helped design the atomic bomb. But as the job of 'computer' became more professionalized (no longer viewed as secretarial) and better paid, it slowly and steadily became the domain of men. Emily Chang explores the very specific personality assessments and hiring practices that pushed women out of the field\u2014and gave rise to the 'antisocial nerd stereotype' popularized by Hollywood\u2014and how it created a work culture hostile to females that persists to this day. It is a history that exposes, unnervingly and unsparingly, how the tech industry itself created and perpetuated this problem, and what can be done to reverse the decades-long slide backward in gender equality in the place that is most shaping the future today. Gigged: The End of the Job and the Future of Work[3] by Sarah Kessler, St. Martin's Press Silicon Valley culture has elevated entrepreneurs to the level of rockstars, and turned the word 'employee' into a dirty word. But in the gig economy, what felt like emancipation from the corporate world to some has been an unfortunate necessity to others, and become the utter exploitation of many. As Sarah Kessler explains: The gig economy had been born as a solution for the business problem of scaling a service business with venture capital. It had been promoted as a solution to economic woes. In 2014 and 2015, the gig economy started to look not like an innovation, but the continuation of a long change in how companies structured their workforce. Not a solution, but a problem in need of one. Most of the companies that rushed to become the 'Uber' of any particular industry found that they soon had a revolt on their hands among those it 'contracted,' and most were facing at least one lawsuit from them. Uber itself, facing 70 lawsuits by the summer of 2016, was a case-in-point. Not only that, but after almost a decade of operations, it is still posting staggering losses. It reported $1.07 billion in losses in just its most recent quarter of operations, coming on the heels of $4.5 billion in losses in 2017. It turns out that 'disrupting' (i.e. decimating) local taxi operations all over the world backed by obscene amounts of venture capital while boosters in the business press and Silicon Valley cheer you on isn't the way to build a truly sustainable business. But Gigged[4] is not really a book about Uber, or any of the companies rushing to emulate their flawed economics. Kessler focuses on the people doing the work. 'Any economy is built by humans,' Kessler writes, 'and this book is about them.' It is a great social history of our moment, and of the need for a new social contract that benefits all involved, and the society around it. The Pan-Industrial Revolution: How New Manufacturing Titans Will Transform the World[5] by Richard D'Aveni, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Richard D'Aveni's new book reads to me, at times, like a dystopian thriller\u2014or, if you want to be more generous, perhaps and Ayn Rand novel (some might not see much difference). That is partly because it contains an element of fiction in it, as Avenatti imagines a future in which a relatively small number of pan-industrial business titans shift the global balance of power and challenge the traditional roles of government and the free enterprise system. Their empires of private enterprise, in D'Aveni's prediction, will be built around 3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM). I would personally rather see antitrust legislation make a comeback to stop such further consolidation, as books like The Curse of Bigness[6] and The Myth of Capitalism[7] suggest. But, if the trends of the last thirty years hold, D'Aveni's predictions are likely to be closer to reality, especially concerning they are likely to transcend any one nation's laws or ability to reign them in. A common narrative you've likely encountered in many other books and articles about the topic\u2014that such technologies enable smaller, independent manufacturing, a so-called maker revolution\u2014D'Aveni believes is a myth. He believes there are also benefits that such pan-industrial titans offer over smaller-scale makers. I am skeptical, but there are signs, he believes, 'that we may now be on the verge of a new golden age of broad-based economic growth, social progress, and widespread contentment\u2014all driven by the technological developments like those described in this book, combined with wise choices by business and political leaders.' Our current crop of business and political leaders leave me worried about those prospects, as do the pronouncements of past tech-utopians, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Silicon City: San Francisco in the Long Shadow of the Valley[8] by Cary McClelland, W.W. Norton ...mpany San Francisco is at the epicenter of a greater inflection point in society being driven by the wider region and the tech economy it spawned. Following in the oral history tradition of Studs Terkel, Cary McClelland sat with over 150 people around the Bay Area, and does a great job of making their stories the story of the book\u2014nuanced, diverse, complicated, intertwined, and ongoing\u2014letting residents excavate the region's rich history, dissect its perilous present, and offer visions for its future. It is the story of longshoremen and housing activists, Google employees and cab drivers, the homeless and the powerful, and everyone in between all mixed together in a kaleidoscopic stew of humanity and great storytelling. We meet those whose illustrious past business achievements make them perfect candidates for explaining what makes the ecosystem of Silicon Valley work, and how to replicate it elsewhere. We also meet many whose example demonstrates how that ecosystem hasn't worked for them, and why we might not want to replicate it. It reveals a divide between individuals yearning for social justice who might not have access to the substantial resources around them or the ears of the technologists, and the technologists themselves who speak often about changing the world, but are sheltered from most people's life experience and daily realities. 'These stories speak not just to San Francisco or California,' writes McClelland, 'but to America. [] Wealth inequality is an American problem. The changing workforce, rapid gentrification, infrastructure collapse, climate change, overcrowded prisons, struggling schools, atrophied public institutions\u2014these are problems in any city, in any state across the country.'  The tech economy is mostly about bringing convenience to the already comfortable these days, but it offers little participation\u2014which is the backbone of our democracy and the only way to ensure economic justice. The voices of Silicon City[9] help us ponder if there is a better way. Silicon States: The Power and Politics of Big Tech and What It Means for Our Future[10] by Lucie Greene, Counterpoint If the disruption so celebrated in Silicon Valley were confined to the Bay Area, it would be one thing. If it were confined to the business world, it would be another. Of course, it is neither. So, we must ask what happens when Silicon Valley layers the information superhighway on top of all our communities and city services. 'When the city becomes connected,' warns Lucie Greene, 'all urban life becomes another product.' This is, to a large extent, already happening. The largest technology companies have become veritable nation states unto themselves. Facebook has more users than any single nation has citizens. Apple's cash reserves, at $285 billion in 2017, are more than double that of the Federal Reserve. The State Department, in 2016, even appointed an official ambassador to Silicon Valley\u2014as if it were a nation separate from our own. And, indeed, with the power and influence it wields, it often acts as one. And these companies not only surveil the populace more than any government in history, 'they know each individual, in some ways, better than friends or families ever could'\u2014better than we know ourselves in some cases. Meanwhile, the government, once the primary engine of innovation in the world, has largely ceded that role to the tech sector, all as the companies that dominate the tech sector have largely avoided the taxes and regulation they might impose. As they've built their wealth, society has become more diverse, even as tech itself has become more exclusively white and male in that time. This has led tech's vision of the future to become, as Greene puts it, one 'architected almost singularly by privileged white men.' That is, it looks a lot like the the nation's past, except with white men that are more socially awkward and less educated. As tech encroaches upon the civil services we all rely upon, and with all the implications it has for our privacy, the press, and so much else, Lucie Greene's Silicon States[11] asks us to pause and ask, is this the future we want?

We felt that, because what is happening in the wider world and public policy is so intimately related to what happens in our business, it behooved us to add books that explored those topics to our deliberations. Our business book awards, which we began in 2007 to recognize work we feel is crucial to our ongoing understanding of business, needed a category to examine the larger forces at work on the business world, and how business interests act as a force on the wider world. All of our categories have some overlap, and that seems to be getting more and more true all the time, but these are the five books specifically at the intersection of business, politics, and the public interest that we believe will stand as a testament to the times we're living in.(I curated this category myself this year, and have borrowed much of the language below from reviews I have written over the course of the year.) </p><p>The CEO Pay Machine: How it Trashes America and How to Stop it[1] by Steven Clifford, Blue Rider Press There is broad consensus that CEO pay in America long ago went beyond being too exorbitant and entered the realm of the absurd. Yet, very little has been done to curb the trend, and very few viable ideas have even been floated. In The CEO Pay Machine[2], you'll learn how ever-rising CEO compensation harms the companies that offer it, has curbed economic growth, and even undermines our very democracy. Steven Clifford, a former CEO himself, will explain why, compared to economic elites, average voters have a low-to-nonexistent influence on public policies. To correct this, he suggests a tweak to regulation, that the 'the SEC should adopt reforms proposed in the seventies to prevent market manipulation in corporate buybacks,' a tool CEOs can also easily use to increase their payday at the expense of shareholders and the health of the economy. He also suggests an idea borrowed from the sports world that I think is brilliant\u2014a luxury tax on excess executive compensation. These remedies and others will give the companies that lead the charge a competitive advantage, help the economy as a whole, and may just save our ongoing experiment in self-governance. The Chessboard and the Web: Strategies of Connection in a Networked World[3] by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Yale University Press The president of the United States announced moments ago that the US has formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending decades of careful US diplomacy and putting the United States at odds policy-wise with the rest of the world. I am not interested in critiquing the president's moves or motives at the moment. What I am interested in is a pragmatic and progressive worldview, and ideas that will help bring about lasting peace and stability. Anne-Marie Slaughter's new book, The Chessboard and the Web[4], offers just that. It arises out of a viewpoint that considers both the 'chessboard' of traditional strategy and the 'web' of interconnected networks and interests in the world. To (perhaps over)simplify, you can think of the chessboard as the nation states in attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, and the an example of a 'the web' would be the select network of powerful people invited to place like Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. As Slaughter notes, 'That map looks very different from the United Nations roster.' But it is just as influential. Slaughter's view of the world is not an 'either/or' interpretation, but a 'both/and' understanding. She believes we need to be able to 'see in stereo,' to understand moves on the chessboard as well as movements in the web. Reading Anne-Marie Slaughter's The Chessboard and the Web[5], I found myself worried that the current administration is working with a skeleton staff, and that a network of career diplomats and dedicated civil servants were dismissed upon the 45th president's arrival in office\u2014the exact time they may be needed most.  Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist [6]by Kate Raworth, Chelsea Green Publishing We live in a world that is, in many ways, presupposed. We stand on the shoulders of giants, yes, but we also inherit their ways of thinking, and sometimes it's necessary to discard the cumulative accepted wisdom of that history and start anew. Kate Raworth believes that the economic view of the world that predominates today, and our addiction to economic growth, is one such area. We are currently so addicted to growth that it is our only goal, the constant economic 'fix' we're chasing. Economists and politicians would have us believe that our other goals will be addressed if and when we achieve such growth, even as history has shown that high-growth has led to increased inequality and more environmental damage in the past. Wall Street dogma dictates that you're only a successful company if you're a growing company, but of course, nothing in nature grows forever. That's not to say growth cannot occur, simply that we need to put other goals first. We need to become growth-agnostic. We need to develop sustainable organizations, models, systems. And it is not a radical idea. Economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill have stated that there would be a limit to growth. Whether we've reached that point or not, perhaps it is time to put the goal of economics sustainability above that of economic growth. Raworth offers a new economic model to do so. A Uterus Is a Feature, Not a Bug: The Working Woman's Guide to Overthrowing the Patriarchy[7] by Sarah Lacy, Harper Business Sarah Lacy has made her career covering the digital economy, which instead of living up to its promise of a more level playing field, better business practices, and a more robust democracy, has led to increased income inequality, corporate hegemony (and, in Silicon Valley, the place that spawned the revolution, corporate homogeneity), and questions about whether these technologies have, in fact, played a role in undermining our democratic elections and institutions. It is the homogeneity, the fact that tech companies are so blindingly white and overwhelmingly male, that may be at the heart of some of the other problems, and the cause Sarah Lacy takes up in her new book, A Uterus Is a Feature, Not a Bug: The Working Woman's Guide to Overthrowing the Patriarchy[8]. It is an almost eerily timely book that, at its core, is how she believes becoming a mother has made her better at her work, and how working has made her a better mother. Once you read her story, you'll never think it could possibly be otherwise. If anything, with the stories of rampant sexual harassment and abuse in the headlines on a daily basis, it seems that if there is a problem in the business world, a bug in the system, it is male reproductive organs. World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech[9] by Franklin Foer, Penguin Press The Merry Prankster and tech utopian Stewart Brand once proclaimed that 'Information wants to be free.' It has largely become so\u2014or at least become very cheap\u2014thanks to Google, Facebook, and Amazon. And yet, 'By collapsing the value of knowledge,' Franklin Foer asserts, 'they have diminished the quality of it.' He believes that these digital firms are fundamentally altering our information diet in a way that is analogous to how the industrial food industry changed our actual diet in the last century; making it much more cheap and easy to consume, but far less less healthy in the process\u2014the intellectual equivalent of junk food. 'The tech companies are destroying something precious,' Foer asserts, 'which is the possibility of contemplation.' Like Clifford's examination of CEO pay, Foer worries that this trend undermines our ability to self-govern, that the big tech firms 'have eroded the integrity of institutions\u2014media, publishing\u2014that supply the intellectual material that provokes thought and guides democracy.' He admonishes the media to start reversing the trend, to stop devaluing the information they provide, believing that when enough people value intellectual health on both an individual and societal level to pay for it, we can start turning things around. Just as we turned back to traditional ways of growing, preparing, and enjoying our food in the slow-food movement, he counsels we turn back to a more tactile, hands on form of consuming information, to turn back to paper and a slow information diet for the good of our collective intelligence.

There are multiple reasons for their slides, but one of the largest forces dragging them down is the growing possibility that countries outside the United States will unleash a new wave of taxes and regulation on the tech superstars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting tough on these all-American giants makes a lot of sense from the perspective of a foreign-policy maker. It's a smart way to simultaneously raise tax revenue while addressing genuine problems such as Facebook's easy ways with user data.</p><p>Until now, the FAANGs have always been able to count on Washington's automatic support in international disputes.</p><p>That may no longer be true. Donald Trump, in particular, has no reason to love the tech sector, which generally leans Democratic.</p><p>To the U.S. President's considerable displeasure, the digital economy has spawned billionaires such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be owner of The Washington Post, a constant thorn in Mr. Trump's side. In what may be a not-entirely unrelated phenomenon, the website Axios reported on Wednesday that sources agree the President is \"obsessed\" with Amazon and wants to bring it down.</p><p>To be fair, the leaders of U.S. tech are adding to their own problems with their shambling responses to international concerns. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive of Facebook, was late in stepping forward to deal with the furor over the user data obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a British company. He then aggravated the insult this week by declining to appear before British MPs investigating fake news and sending a substitute instead.</p><p>For its part, Google was hit with a record 2.4-billion ($3.8billion) fine last year after the European Union decided the online giant had rigged its search results to favour its own shopping service. This week, The Telegraph newspaper in Britain reported that Margrethe Vestager, Competition Commissioner in the European bloc, remains deeply suspicious of Google's dominance and has not ruled breaking it up.</p><p>One sign of the European Union's growing aggressiveness is its proposal, unveiled this month, for a 3-per-cent tax on the digital revenues of online giants. The levy, which could raise up to 5-billion a year, would be imposed on money generated from digital advertising and subscriber fees, as well as on the cash raised from selling users' personal data to market research firms and others.</p><p>Investors are just beginning to grapple with the potential impact of such moves. The fall in the share prices of the FAANGs, as well as the wider weakness across the technology sector, demonstrates the growing awareness that tech's future may be rockier than its past.</p><p>Higher taxes and more regulation, particularly when it comes to customer data, are by far the most likely outcome of the current conflicts. Far scarier would be an escalating trade war in which each region would move to protect its own tech assets. For now, it's hard to predict what shape official action might take. But the FAANG stocks are, in general, so generously priced that it would require little to knock them down further. With Amazon shares changing hands for more than 300 times earnings, and Netflix stock going for more than 200 times profits, any factor that upsets the sky-high expectations around them is reason for a sell-off.</p><p>The smartest move for investors may be to wait and watch how the tech giants react to the current concerns. To date, the FAANGs have consistently disappointed. Despite huge budgets, they've failed to address genuine concerns over fake news, customer privacy and the disruptive impact of their operations in jurisdictions where they pay little in taxes.</p><p>The real surprise is how little prepared they were for what seems, at least in retrospect, to have been an inevitable backlash. The first step in restoring their appeal to investors would be evidence of a new attitude.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180329rbimmcgugantech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S05-8M51-F06S-3020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-242881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHM-56K1-JDJ6-K30C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>6:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 19, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. Anne-Marie Slaughter, who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like Ro Khanna, the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-242988</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ2-3KV1-JDJ6-K3MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>9:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-243055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJG-2131-F118-948V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>7:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 23, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-243117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJX-0CH1-JDJ6-K4X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>7:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 25, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-242740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGJ-9CX1-F118-91PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>10:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-114606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F5D-H8G1-JDJ6-K0MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>6:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-242856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHD-62W1-JDJ6-K2BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>9:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But what happens when they aim for the tech giants?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. <person><nameText>Anne-Marie Slaughter, </nameText></person>who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news \"false\"-then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer's scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Lynn's group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.</p><p>Slaughter acknowledged the goal in her Medium post, where she described the split from New America as \"the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team weren't exactly caught out by their separation from New America: By the time the Times story came out, they were ready with a whole new website depicting Google as an evil octopus, with headshots of the whole team promising to take on corporate monopolies. They're launching a new think tank, called the Open Markets Institute, which will have a staff of 20 to 25 people, including a group of lawyers planning to work with state attorneys general to push antitrust cases at the state level.</p><p>Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like <person><nameText>Ro Khanna, </nameText></person>the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a \"bad president\" who is \"ideologically averse to democracy\" and whose policies \"entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system.\" At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.</p><p>\"[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,\" said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. \"It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies-a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.</p><p>Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-maybe even Republican-voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit.</p><p>\"I give them a lot of credit for being visionaries on this and driving it and speaking about it when they were voices in the wilderness,\" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, who supports stronger antitrust enforcement.</p><p>This new antitrust movement is gaining some real traction, with a recent wave of coverage in BuzzFeed, POLITICO and elsewhere about how the tech giants are no longer sacred cows in D.C. The Democrats adopted stronger antitrust language in their platform in 2016 and, more recently, in their \"Better Deal\" agenda.</p><p>But for all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-but are big political allies of the Democrats.</p><p>To Lynn, that's not exactly a surprise. \"Most people don't understand how really different this philosophy is,\" he said. But he's thrilled at the progress that has been made in just the past few years. What started from some uninformed thoughts after a hurricane hit Taiwan almost 20 years ago has now become a leading plank in the Democratic Party. \"This is moving very rapidly,\" he said hopefully. \"People are coming to understand this.\"</p><p>The scandal over Google and New America is, if anything, the best evidence that Open Markets is starting to matter, and attract attention, in Washington. But it's far from certain that the Democratic Party is willing to swallow it wholesale. It may amount to a bet on the future of the party that the party's leaders are not willing to make.</p><p>LYNN DATES HIS own awakening to a specific day: September 21, 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Jiji, Taiwan, killing almost 2,500 people and causing billions in damage. At the time, Lynn was the executive editor of Global Business, a magazine for business executives with stories about NAFTA and the WTO. But he quickly found himself fixated on the Taiwan earthquake-not on the natural disaster itself but on its effect on businesses in America, thousands of miles away.</p><p>Soon after the earthquake, the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, plunged. He wondered why, and discovered that the earthquake had temporarily shut down an industrial park that made a significant percentage of computer components. The industry had become so concentrated that American companies half a world away were paralyzed by the lack of a crucial part. For Lynn, it was a warning shot. Corporate concentration had made the global industrial economy much more fragile than it looked. He called it the first \"modern industrial crash\" and wondered what might happen if the earthquake were bigger, or if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p>\"I assumed initially that someone understood this,\" Lynn said. But after talking with business leaders and policymakers, he realized no one had really thought it through. </p><p>He joined New America in 2001 and four years later, he published a book, called End of the Line, about the dangers of America's complex supply chains. The book garnered real interest-he briefed senior officials at the Treasury Department, CIA and Department of Defense-but Washington quickly united around a different interpretation: Far from a threat to America's national and economic security, the new globalized economy raised the costs of war, effectively guaranteeing peace.</p><p>Disappointed but undeterred, Lynn focused on what he believed had made America's supply chains so fragile: corporate concentration. Lynn came to see concentration not just as a supply-chain problem, but as an economic and political problem-one that posed threats to both American prosperity and democracy itself.</p><p>In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, \"Cornered,\" which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with \"consumer welfare,\" generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.</p><p>Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the \"New Brandeis\" movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.) </p><p>If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. \"We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,\" said Lynn. \"The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.\" In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. \"When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.\"</p><p>\"It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,\" he added. \"Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.\"</p><p>The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that \"people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.\"</p><p>In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in \"Cornered\" and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. \"We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,\" said Stoller, \"but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.\" </p><p>The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-if unseen-entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy.</p><p>Asked about Lynn's theory that they constitute new monopolies, Amazon and Facebook declined to comment for this story. Google did not comment on that issue, but on the topic of the New America departure said: \"We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don't agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group's independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.\"</p><p>IT WOULD BE an understatement to say that this view is unpopular among antitrust lawyers. On both sides of the aisle, support for the Bork consumer welfare framework remains almost unanimous. Even those who favor stronger antitrust enforcement simply say the consumer welfare framework has been misapplied. It shouldn't be trashed altogether.</p><p>\"The consumer welfare standard is a much more encompassing standard than some people realize,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, who has long advocated tougher enforcement. \"It isn't just about price. We just need rigorous, creative, proactive enforcement.\"</p><p>For this story I called a number of former officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the two agencies chiefly responsible for antitrust enforcement. Nearly all declined to speak to me on the record but were happy to privately criticize the new antitrust movement. In part, their concerns are pragmatic: Many critics believe the Bork revolution created a predictable enforcement regime on which both regulators and corporations could rely; by not overregulating, it unlocked efficiency-enhancing corporate deals that would have previously been blocked. They expressed skepticism about how the FTC or DOJ would actually evaluate merger proposals under the looser framework favored by the new antitrust movement. Empowering unelected staff attorneys to recommend enforcement actions for political reasons, critics say, is dangerous. And even if regulators adopted such a system, they would get laughed out of court.</p><p>As for the big tech firms, antitrust lawyers argue that \"competition is just a click away\" for online firms; unlike launching a new airline or railroad, it requires little capital or physical infrastructure to create a new search engine or social media platform. \"At a moment when there are actual harms creating pocketbook issues for consumers across the economy,\" said Abigail Slater, general counsel of the Internet Association and a former FTC attorney, \"it is disappointing that so much time and attention is being paid to the internet, which has a storied track record of lowering transaction costs for consumers and providing people with high-quality services for free.\"</p><p>Lynn, Stoller and their allies have even acquired the disparaging nickname \"hipster antitrust,\" which was coined on Twitter by law professor Joshua Wright and was used by Senator Orrin Hatch on the Senate floor in late July in a speech critical of the new antitrust movement. \"Nobody would mistake me for a hipster,\" Hatch concluded. </p><p>There is some evidence that antitrust enforcement has been too lax in recent decades. Academic papers have found growing concentration across industries and have linked that concentration to increased markups, increased corporate profits and decreased investment, leading even some Republicans to support tougher enforcement, most prominently Senator Mike Lee. But when I asked his office about the new antitrust movement, a senior Lee aide pushed back. \"There's momentum in some quarters on the left to revise how we do antitrust and to use it to shape markets to better fit certain people's aesthetic preferences,\" the aide said. \"If we follow through on those ideas, it will hurt consumers and will hurt American businesses.\"</p><p>Lynn and his team respond that the problem with the current antitrust regime has less to do with its processes and more to do with its goals. Before the Bork revolution, Stoller explained, the government used a range of tools to measure and combat monopolies, and the system worked perfectly well. \"Antitrust is complicated,\" he said, \"but there's no magic here.\" </p><p>More to the point, Lynn doesn't care that much whether antitrust lawyers are convinced of their ideas. \"Our goal is to change the way policymakers see the world,\" he said. \"Once policymakers signal they want policy to go in a different direction, the technocrats will learn the new ways. Or they will leave and go back to their farms.\"</p><p>OVER THE PAST two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their \"Better Deal\" agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.</p><p>Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including POLITICO, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). \"With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,\" Lynn said. \"We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.\" The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality. </p><p>Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. \"The central conduit was Barry Lynn,\" said Maxwell. \"We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.\"</p><p>In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. \"I love markets,\" Warren exclaimed to a packed room. \"Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.\" She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that \"competition is dying.\"</p><p>In a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.</p><p>But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' \"Better Deal\" agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-but it doesn't mention the tech industry.</p><p>Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and \"Better Deal\" agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy. </p><p>\"They've made a major step forward,\" Lynn said. \"[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.\"</p><p>\"We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,\" said Representative Khanna. \"My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.\"</p><p>To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were  really to target these firms-by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-the political consequences could be severe.</p><p>Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success-that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. \"Antitrust is a critical part of this,\" said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. \"It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.\"</p><p>For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. \"The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,\" he said. \"They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.\"</p><p>He added, \"We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-243034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-32V1-F118-93M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4254\"/><timeReceived>10:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being. The Financial Post set out explore what is needed for businesses to flourish and grow. You can find all of our coverage here.( <url normalizedValue=\"http://innovation.financialpost.com\">http://innovation.financialpost.com</url>/ )</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government put the word out last July: it needed someone to study the landscape for financial technology companies, or fintechs, and figure out how they were getting along with the big banks and other financial institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sue Britton's firm, Toronto-based Fintech Growth Syndicate Inc., won the contract for the study. In January, the group said it turned in a 240-page report, the first of its kind in Canada, that used only publicly available data sourced from more than 60 different websites.</p><p>What it found, among other things, was that there were approximately 1,000 fintechs across Canada offering services or products related to crowdfunding, insurance, wealth management, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, capital markets, lending and payments.</p><p>The majority of those companies were startups, founded in the years following 2012, and employed less than 99 people each, though combined they had more than 30,000 people. Perhaps more eye-catching was the estimated value of fintech startups in Canada: $30.5 billion.</p><p>Innovation Nation: How Canada's big banks are holding back the knowledge economy( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/innovation-nation-how-canadas-banks-are-holding-back-the-knowledge-economy\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/innovation-nation-how-canadas-banks-are-holding-back-the-knowledge-economy</url> )</p><p>How to finance a Canadian tech startup, from pre-seed to series D( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/how-to-finance-and-canadian-tech-startup\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/how-to-finance-and-canadian-tech-startup</url> )</p><p>Canada's cybersecurity firms keep turning to the U.S. for funding, leaving us without a homegrown leader( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-cybersecurity-firms-u-s-funding\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-cybersecurity-firms-u-s-funding</url> )</p><p>What the study did not find, however, was 1,000 partnerships with financial institutions: Canada's Big Five banks may have been increasing their engagement with fintechs, but \"the majority of their efforts\" were still on building their own products and digital experiences. They were also busy trying to update their \"bowl of spaghetti\" technologies and systems, some of which may be decades old.</p><p>As a result, one of Canada's biggest industries is innovating at a relatively tame pace, the country is lagging its peers in adopting new financial technologies and consumers of all types may be paying more for services than they should. The financial industry's existing business models could eventually come under pressure as well.</p><p>\"To the extent that we could find publicly available information, we were able to show that, yes, there are some fintechs that are partnering with financial institutions,\" Britton said. \"But certainly the majority of those partnerships are on the financial institutions' terms. They're not groundbreaking new business models ... It's not going to make the marketplace more competitive, because it's going to, in fact, if anything, grow the business for the incumbent.\"</p><p>Retaining the status quo may be all well and good for big banks and insurance companies for now. It may even be good for their customers - and most financial consumers have a connection to a big bank or insurer - who may be enjoying a smoother user experience or a new platform at their current institution of choice.</p><p>But legacy financial companies face a bit of a conflict of interest when it comes to innovation. After all, they have earnings targets to hit, shareholders to keep happy and thousands of employees and existing systems already in place to meet those goals. Why risk cannibalizing such profitable businesses or, moreover, give the vaunted stability of Canada's financial industry a jolt?</p><p>Yet the incumbents could wake up one day to find their lunches being eaten by big-tech firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., which are already offering a payments solution, some more aggressively than others.</p><p>\"What our big banks aren't doing is moving as quickly as other parts of the world, innovating their business models, extending financial services to more small businesses or reducing their fees,\" Fintech Growth Syndicate said. \"Perhaps, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, 'give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe,' they are still sharpening the axe.\"</p><p>It's also possible that no one is even swinging an axe in the financial sector, despite the federal government's efforts to push the innovation envelope in various industries.</p><p>Competition Bureau research \"points to low levels of financial technology adoption in Canada relative to other countries, and limited consumer engagement driven, in part, by frictions associated with shopping around and switching,\" according to a document published in February by the interim commissioner of competition. \"These factors are symptoms of a market that is not functioning to its full potential.\"</p><p>Britton believes the major banks and insurers face the innovator's dilemma, first outlined in a 1997 book by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen: An incumbent with a big base of existing customers and shareholders demanding good returns is unlikely to welcome a company that could disrupt its own business.</p><p>On the other hand, \"You don't want to wake up one day and be Blockbuster,\" she said.</p><p>Nobody, of course, wants to be compared to a bankrupt video-store chain, which is why the financial sector is certainly aware that the big-tech companies are making inroads into their business.</p><p>Royal Bank of Canada chief executive Dave McKay reportedly noted in mid-March that he was increasingly concerned with the prospect of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (the FANG companies) getting into banking.</p><p>\"They are getting between us and the moments of truth of our customers, and currently what they do with that is they sell that insight back to us in the form of search and advertising and other perspectives, and they earn a certain amount of economic rent,\" he said, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>RBC and the other big financial institutions know they need to up their game, something that was noted by Luge Capital, a Canadian venture fund focused on fintech and artificial intelligence, when it did its own scan of the fintech landscape for a report published last October.</p><p>Luge Capital, which has been backed by institutions such as the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Sun Life Financial Inc., found the climate for possible partnerships between startups and big banks or insurers had improved.</p><p>\"Large incumbents have customers, well-established brands and vaults of financial resources,\" the report said. \"As a venture capital fund with large financial institutions backers, such as Sunlife, Desjardins, CDPQ and La Capital and Le Fonds FTQ, we see first hand their desire to partner with early stage innovators.\"</p><p>The biggest banks may still have the \"vast majority\" of the market share in financial services, but there has been a shift recently, said Karim Gillani, general partner at Luge Capital.</p><p>\"In the last three to five years, there's been a widespread recognition amongst the FIs (financial institutions) that they need to work with the early stage or smaller fintech companies in order to enhance their service offering for their customers,\" he said.</p><p>Gillani said there was value in financial institutions exploring new ways of \"offering functionality,\" such as robo-advisers as a form of wealth management, something several banks have already done.</p><p>\"It's a demonstration of how banks are shifting their view from the traditional wealth-management experience to something that's more automated and driven by technology so that it becomes appealing to a different segment of the population,\" he said.</p><p>The federal government might open another door for the fintechs to get to the market. Ottawa is currently considering the idea of open banking, which is supposed to give people more control of their data and make it more portable.</p><p>The competition commissioner, in a submission made in response to a government consultation paper that outlined the benefits and concerns of open banking, said the framework could allow consumers to shop around and compare prices, potentially stirring up competition by lowering search costs.</p><p>\"Banks would be forced to compete harder for consumers, and consumers would have access to a broader range of services, if the benefits of technology could be more fully exploited through open banking,\" the submission stated.</p><p>Yet bringing third parties into Canada's financial system - renowned for its stability - has raised some concern for at least one federal regulator, who pointed out that such decentralization \"magnifies non-financial risks and diffuses accountability.\"</p><p>Ben Gully, assistant superintendent at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, raised the issue in a little-noticed speech in February, noting that new tools will be required to manage these concerns.</p><p>\"Technology will enable or accelerate further decentralization of financial market participants and blur the boundaries of a traditional regulated financial institution,\" he said, according to a copy of his remarks.</p><p>In other words, increasing the number of touch points increases the number of potential vulnerable spots and the likelihood that the buck no longer stops with a bank, which is where regulators are used to seeing it stop.</p><p>Instead of worrying that banks carry enough capital, watchdogs now have to worry about the type of cloud storage or anti-virus software that lenders use, but do not entirely control.</p><p>\"We have seen the link between non-financial risks and their impact on reputation, such as the public and stakeholder responses to third-party privacy breaches,\" Gully said. \"These can quickly affect an institution's operations, its ability to grow its business and, potentially, its bottom line.\"</p><p>But it's hard to see the financial industry shunning technology completely. The uses for paper bankbooks and even brick-and-mortar branches are becoming fewer and farther between as customer preferences shift toward mobile and online banking and other financial services.</p><p>There are also strong signs that other sectors are chomping at the bit for the financial industry to adopt more innovations.</p><p>For example, Wayne Pommen was in Las Vegas earlier in March looking over hundreds of tables and chairs and signs, all lined up to match retailers with the tech companies vying to serve them. It was a scene not dissimilar to a speed-dating event.</p><p>\"I'm in a sea of logos,\" Pommen, chief executive of Toronto-based fintech PayBright, told the Financial Post in a phone interview during a break in the action.</p><p>PayBright is a consumer lender, paying retailers the next business day while allowing customers to pay off their purchases in instalments, and the retail conference was the perfect place to announce some news: Pommen's firm revealed a partnership with Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna Bank AB, which could allow thousands of merchants worldwide to offer the PayBright option to Canadian customers.</p><p>The money for PayBright's payments comes from the same place as it does for a lot of folks: banks. The company has received funding from Canadian Western Bank, as well as the Canadian Business Growth Fund, which is backed by the Big Six banks, as well as major insurers.</p><p>Pommen said the big banks may have massive consumer bases and lower costs of capital, but the fintechs can offer faster ways to deploy technology and develop better user experiences.</p><p>\"Most banks and fintechs have realized there's huge benefits to partnership,\" he said.</p><p>A report released on March 25 by Toronto Finance International, a tie-up between government, the financial-services sector and academia, found growing collaboration between financial institutions and fintechs, but \"key challenges\" on both ends of these partnerships.</p><p>\"In our discussions with executives of Canadian financial institutions, one problem outlined was difficulty in finding the right fintech offering enterprise-ready products or services meeting the scalability and security requirements of FI's systems,\" the report said. \"Also, with a relatively lower technology adoption rate as compared to other global fintech hubs, Canadian businesses tend to look for proven solutions when partnering with fintechs.\"</p><p>The Toronto Finance International report - which noted financial institutions can provide fintechs with mentorship and guidance in addition to financing - also found that Canadian fintech hubs were trailing when it came to embracing disruptive technology.</p><p>But Canadian consumers, most of whom bank with at least one of the Big Six, may have no idea such alternatives exist.</p><p>\"Some think that consumers don't want fintech solutions because adoption in Canada is lower than other regions, and that there isn't a need to aggressively enable a more competitive financial services market,\" FGS said. \"But maybe it's not because Canadians don't want fintech products - it's that they don't know that opportunity is out there.\"</p><p>The number of those products is also increasing, with or without partnership, but may be losing some steam.</p><p>At the time of Fintech Growth Syndicate's study, only parts of which were shared with the Financial Post, there were 995 fintech companies in Canada. That has since increased to more than 1,050, it said, although the rate of new companies being created has been in decline in recent years. The TFI report found that the number of fintech startups founded in the Toronto region dropped to nine last year from 33 in 2014.</p><p>To help make some of those companies successful, Britton suggested governments look at their own structures. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority acts as the financial-services watchdog and has a mandate to promote competition. OSFI, as one example, does not have such a mandate.</p><p>It will take time for Canada to begin adopting tech like other countries, Britton said.

Lawmakers and advo...</p><p>Groups are jockeying to shape the congressional hearing of the CEOs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.    A week ahead of the congressional hearing of four of the most powerful tech industry CEOs, the power struggle has already started.    Lawmakers and advocacy groups are jockeying to shape the logistics of the first-of-its-kind July 27 gathering where the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will face questions \u2014 likely virtually \u2014 from the House's top antitrust panel. Seemingly small details, they say, could decide whether the hearing succeeds in pinning down the executives about their companies' alleged misconduct.      The testimony is drawing attention just for the fact that the four chief executives \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, whose companies are worth a combined $4 trillion \u2014 are appearing together before lawmakers for the first time. It's also the first congressional appearance ever for Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man.     The committee has yet to disclose crucial details about the hearing format, including whether the CEOs will testify simultaneously or how much time lawmakers will get to grill the moguls. In the interim, some lawmakers and advocacy groups are demanding big changes they hope will make it harder for the tech executives to skate by unscathed. And that task could be even harder given the additional logistical intricacies of what's expected to be a largely virtual hearing.    \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to fight for is a format in which the CEOs cannot hide behind each other or take advantage of the structure, to show up and get credit for showing up, but not actually provide the information that the subcommittee is seeking,\u201d said big tech critic Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project.   Tech's critics want the CEOs to testify separately   Miller's organizations and tech antitrust advocates are calling for the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee to make the tech CEOs testify individually. In a recent letter to the committee, they voiced concern that CEOs will be able to more easily dodge questions if they testify side-by-side on the same panel.                 Separate, individualized testimony would also give lawmakers more opportunity to delve into the nuanced concerns over each company\u2019s business model, said Miller. While Google has drawn antitrust scrutiny for its dominance in search and online advertising, for instance, Amazon's role as massive e-commerce hub has drawn the attention of legislators and regulators alike. That makes the prospect of addressing them simultaneously a taller task than other past high-profile groups of CEOs on Capitol Hill, such as the famed 1994 grilling of seven tobacco industry chiefs .    \u201cEven though these are all kind of classified as tech companies, it\u2019s not the same as the tobacco industry. They\u2019re very distinct corporations,\" Miller said. She argued separate testimony will give lawmakers time to direct detailed questions at each CEO and get comprehensive answers.    That ask is facing pushback from officials in the tech industry, who say Congress shouldn\u2019t subject each of the tech leaders to the same multi-day marathon of questions Zuckerberg experienced in 2018 at the height of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal .    \u201cSuch a move would be unfair to the witnesses who have agreed in good faith to subject themselves to this hearing,\u201d said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel tech trade  group NetChoice. His group, one of the tech industry\u2019s most aggressive lobbying forces in Washington, counts Google, Facebook and Amazon among its members.    \u201cWe already saw how Mark Zuckerberg when he last testified was up there for hours on end. Now multiply that times four,\" Szabo added. If each CEO testified on separate panels, lawmakers could get five minutes or more to question each one, rather than a similar amount of time allotted to questions for the group.   Republicans want more lawmakers in the room   The House Judiciary Committee this month announced that the hearing would be held by its antitrust subcommittee, which has spearheaded Judiciary\u2019s yearlong investigation into allegations of tech companies stifling their competitors.    David Segal, executive director of advocacy group Demand Progress, said that move ensures that the lawmakers most knowledgeable about the topic get a crack at questioning the heads of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple.    \u201cThe members here have been studying this issue for at least a year and are experts at it, at least in relative terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a unique opportunity whereby people who are more thoroughly informed than ever before can ask particularized questions intentionally directed in a way that\u2019s not been the case in the past.\u201d    But Judiciary's top Republican, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, is pushing Democrats to allow the committee\u2019s full membership to take part in the session, citing the fact that the panel's lawmakers have express a wide range of concerns about the conduct of the tech giants.    In a letter last week to Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Jordan said broader participation would \u201cmakes the most sense given the scope of the Committee\u2019s investigation.\"    By holding the session at the subcommittee level, Democrats may be looking to minimize the chances that their blockbuster hearing veers from its focal point: to dive deep into allegations that tech giants are harming competitors and consumers alike.                 Tech executives, including Zuckerberg and Pichai, have been hauled up to testify before scores of congressional committees in recent years, for hearings dedicated to issues such as online privacy, the proliferation of fake news on the internet and allegations that social media companies stifle conservative viewpoints. But those hearings have often veered into topics well beyond their stated focus, with lawmakers raising charges of an anti-GOP bias at hearings on foreign disinformation and bringing up concerns over hate speech at sessions on cryptocurrency .    But NetChoice\u2019s Szabo said he expects that to happen either way.    \u201cRegardless of whether it is limited to the antitrust subcommittee or open to the full committee, the discussion will go well beyond antitrust,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will go into issues of election interference, or conservative bias, or any of the other issues de jour on which we like to saddle tech.\u201d   Liberals and conservatives are at odds over time-keeping   Left-leaning advocacy groups have called for giving subcommittee members extended time to delve deep in their questioning \u2014 another reason, they say, for having the CEOs testify separately. But Jordan has said the committee should keep to its usual practice of giving each member five minutes for questions, which he says would enable more lawmakers to partake.    According to another letter Jordan sent to Nadler last week, antitrust subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.) plans to allow more time for member questions by granting lawmakers double the usual five minutes to question lawmakers. In addition, Jordan said, Democrats plan to allow one lawmaker on each side of the aisle to question the CEOs for a separate period of up to 30 minutes.    \u201cThis extended questioning, while perhaps well-intended, undermines your chief argument against convening the hearing at the full committee level \u2014 namely, your commitments to the companies that the hearing would not be overly time-intensive,\u201d Jordan wrote.    Details on the questioning format have yet to be announced, and spokespeople for Nadler and Cicilline declined to comment on the calls for format changes.    But Miller said it\u2019s important that lawmakers have a chance to pose questions over a \u201csignificant and extended period\u201d to maximize their chances of extracting information from the executives.    The committee has been at odds with the tech giants over its demands that the companies fork over information and documents that lawmakers say are crucial to the completion of their investigation on competition in the tech sector. Giving lawmakers ample time to pose questions to each CEO, antitrust advocates argue, strengthens Congress\u2019 chances of getting those details.    But if they can\u2019t, Miller said, that could tee up a massive legal bout between the lawmakers and the companies.    \u201cIf we see problems with CEOs not being forthcoming or trying to dodge questions or trying to hide behind each other, we\u2019d expect the subcommittee to fight to get subpoenas for additional information that\u2019s required,\u201d she said, \u201cso that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be looking for coming out of the hearing.\u201d      The reality of a largely virtual session is setting in   Judiciary leaders had long signaled their desire to bring in the tech CEOs to testify as part of their antitrust probe \u2014 but none could have imagined the partly online setup now set to take place.    Though the committee hasn't explicitly said that the CEOs will not appear in person on Capitol Hill, it announced that earlier this month that \"witnesses and Members are allowed to appear virtually\" \u2014 making remote testimony likely. That could make it more challenging for lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have been slow to adapt to the virtual reality of the coronavirus era , to press the tech moguls for answers in real-time.    It remains to be seen whether officials will be able to generate the same level of intensity as past must-watch big tech hearings in a partly virtual format. Congressional testimony by tech leaders in past years has been marked by heated questioning and tense back-and-forth sessions. But attempts to replicate that energy could run into the same technical snafus and lost-in-translation hiccups that have become commonplace in virtual workplaces amid Covid-19.    Demand Progress' Segal said it makes sense to Congress to \"relax\" its rules on in-person testimony for this and other hearings due to Covid-19. But he is optimistic it won't get in the way of officials getting the answers they seek from the CEOs.    \"There's nothing that stops people from asking pointed questions and there's nothing that changes the fact that CEOs are required to speak truthfully and engage as they would in person,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42643456556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D9-8941-JCSC-J3F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With two successive quarters of growth, both in the number of deals struck and the amount of money invested, as well as a growing appetite on the part of public markets for shares in venture-backed startups, there's reason for cautious optimism going into the second half of this year.</p><p><br/> Using data and projections from Crunchbase, this report from Crunchbase News dives deep into the state of the global venture capital ecosystem. Here, we want to assess investment and liquidity - money in versus money out.<br/> In the Money in section we'll cover Crunchbase's projections of how - and how much - the global venture capital ecosystem invested in Q2 2017. We'll then evaluate how that result compares to both Q1 2017 and Q2 2016, giving us perspective on sequential quarter and year-over-year performance.<br/> In the Money out section we'll review acquisition statistics and highlight other notable liquidity events, including the thawing market for technology IPOs.<br/> To help you digest this report, each section will contain a bullish and bearish key finding. Without further ado, let's dive in. Money in<br/> Bullish key finding. Both deal and dollar volume are up across almost all stages, and round sizes continue to grow. Across most measures, the global VC market is on track to return to previous highs by the end of this year, if growth continues.<br/> Bearish key finding. Despite growth in dollar and deal volume, measures of late-stage financings suggest a return to historic highs will be slower to come. Also, very late-stage technology growth equity rounds have continued a multi-quarter downtrend.<br/> An overview of the venture capital landscape<br/> In the second quarter of 2017, the global venture capital industry continued the trajectory set by the first quarter, one of recovery from a slump in the second half of 2016 due to looming uncertainty.<br/> Between concerns over ballooning and seemingly unsustainable valuations of the U.S.'s largest private tech companies, a stopped-up tech IPO market, the contentious presidential election in the U.S., the referendum for the United Kingdom to leave the EU, the endless and intractable Euro crisis and roiling financial markets in China, among other issues, it's surprising that the global venture capital market didn't slow down even more.<br/> Now, for better and worse, many sources of uncertainty have come to a head, and investors have seemingly adjusted to the new normal. Q2 2017 was all about extending the gains made in the first quarter of the year. Global funding activity: A view from cruising altitude<br/> To provide an overview of the state of venture finance around the world, we examined the number and volume of venture deals. The scope of analysis presented in this section is broad and high-level. It includes the number and size of venture capital deals and a quick look at some of the investors who've led the most deals.<br/> Pace of dealmaking<br/> By taking a look at the number of deals struck in this and the four previous quarters, we're able to get a good grasp on how private-market investors felt about the previous months.<br/> Crunchbase projects that the total number of equity funding rounds in Q2 2017 increased by roughly 5.7 percent compared to Q1, amounting to approximately 300 more rounds. This change was primarily driven by a rise in seed, angel and early-stage funding rounds.<br/> On an annual basis, the number of funding rounds at all stages grew by a projected 8.8 percent from Q2 2016, roughly 500 more rounds, which again was driven by robust growth in deals struck with earlier-stage companies.<br/> We'll discuss the changes within each kind of investment in a later section. Projected VC dollar volume<br/> Here too, Crunchbase's projections suggest that the global venture capital market is continuing its onward and upward trajectory. The total amount of capital deployed in Q2 2017 is up significantly from the local minimum of Q4 2016. That said, there are still ways to go before the market returns to the heady days of 2015 and early 2016.<br/> Below, we've plotted Crunchbase's projections for the total amount of funding in Q2 2017 and the year preceding it.<br/> On a quarterly basis, Crunchbase projects a 16 percent increase in the total dollar volume of venture investment over the first quarter of this year. This translates to a projected $6.6 billion increase in the amount of capital deployed into startups of all stages. The gains, on a quarterly basis, are fairly evenly distributed, with angel and seed, early-stage and late-stage startups receiving around 20 percent or more funding this quarter than in previous quarters. Only technology growth rounds saw a quarterly decline in dollar volume.<br/> As we alluded to earlier, the global venture capital market is not quite back to recent highs. The projected $47.8 billion invested in Q2 2017 is still 7.2 percent less than the projected $51.5 billion invested in the second quarter of last year. Both early- and late-stage investment is down relative to the same period in 2016.<br/> However, seed and technology growth categories are up 16.5 and 10.75 percent, respectively. Because both of these funding stages make up such a small proportion of the total dollar volume, it is unlikely the entire industry will reach parity with Q2 2016.<br/> Most active lead investors<br/> We analyzed data for roughly 3,200 venture financing rounds from this quarter. This data was extracted from Crunchbase, which typically designates lead investors on a given deal. Based on the set of rounds for which lead investors are listed, we then summarized that data by the count of those lead investors. In total, we identified more than 1,250 separate investors that led one or more rounds this quarter.<br/> In the chart below, you can find a list of the most active lead investors, globally, across all stages. Note that these rankings are likely to shift as more data comes in.<br/> In this quarter, it appears as though there was a significant uptick in round leadership by some of the biggest investors in the business. For example, in our Q1 report, we found that Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings tied for first place in the rankings, each having led nine rounds. This quarter, however, Accel led 20 rounds, whereas Sequoia and Tencent led 14 and 11 rounds, respectively.<br/> This quarter's lead investor leaderboard has some new additions, such as General Catalyst, which led rounds in Grammarly and Samsara, among others. SoftBank makes its first appearance on this list as well; in the past quarter, the Japanese conglomerate led cybersecurity firm Cybereason's Series D and U.K.-based Improbable's improbably large $502 million Series B round, among others. Another first-timer is True Ventures, which alongside Kleiner Perkins, Fidelity Investments and Wellington Management co-led the $325 million Series E round that pedaled Peloton onto the unicorn list.<br/> This being said, apart from some unexpected newcomers and a sudden drop-off in round leadership by others, the majority of the firms on this list represent \"the usual suspects.\" Most are stalwarts of the industry with a long track record of success and billions of dollars under management.<br/> Now that we've explored this quarter's global funding landscape from a macro perspective, it's time to dial in on the specifics of each stage.<br/> Stage-by-stage analysis of Q2 VC funding trends<br/> The following charts show the average size of various rounds at different stages of the fundraising cycle. These metrics serve as helpful points of comparison when looking at rounds closed during this and future quarters.<br/> We'll start \"close to the metal\" with seed and angel financings and work our way up the stack to large technology growth rounds.<br/> Angel and seed-stage deals<br/> With rare exception, incipient companies don't tend to raise a lot of money. This is true both for individual companies and the asset class as a whole. Although Crunchbase projects that in Q2 just over 60 percent of the investment deals were struck by seed and angel investors, they accounted for roughly 4.6 percent of the total dollar volume.<br/> Below, we've included a chart that shows the number of deals and the amount of money invested in seed and angel deals.<br/> On a quarterly basis, both dollar and deal volume are up, albeit by varying degrees. Projections from Crunchbase indicated that, globally, deal volume is up by roughly three percent, resulting in a hundred more companies receiving funding this quarter versus last quarter. Although the quarterly gains in the number of seed and angel rounds are fairly modest, the projected increase in dollar volume is anything but. Crunchbase's projections point to a 23 percent rise, since last quarter, in the amount of money investors committed to very young companies - a change of around $400 million.<br/> The total amount of capital invested is only part of the money side of the story. The following chart shows growth in both mean and median round sizes. Unlike the projected data above, which tries to account for rounds that likely occurred but haven't yet been announced, the data presented below is based only on rounds that have already been recorded.<br/> It's clear that the size of seed and angel rounds is on the rise. The average round grew by 44 percent relative to Q1 2016 and the median round is a more noteworthy 75 percent larger than the median round from the previous quarter. The change since last year is even more remarkable considering that the average round is 62.5 percent larger, and the median is again 75 percent larger, than those closed during the same period last year.<br/> Let's take a look at the investors that were involved in the most angel and seed deals last quarter.<br/> Just like last quarter, it should come as no surprise that many of the most active seed- and angel-stage investors are accelerator programs. After all, these organizations are in the business of providing small amounts of capital to a relatively large number of fledgling companies. It's likely that some of these numbers will change as more rounds from this quarter are added to the historical data. However, unless one or more investors have made dozens of investments this quarter and managed to keep them all under the radar, this list still holds up.<br/> (Note: Due to a quirk in how Crunchbase classifies the \"Angel-Seed\" category, Crowdcube, an equity crowdfunding platform, is included in this list.)<br/> Moving right along, the following table lists a number of notable seed and angel investment rounds closed in Q2 from around the world.<br/> Early-stage deals<br/> Early-stage investments - mostly comprised of Series A and Series B rounds - are where things start to get interesting. The overwhelming majority of participants in these rounds are institutional investors, and considering that these deals make up a projected 30 percent of rounds and 35 percent of total dollar volume in Q2, this data will likely provide us with a better understanding of investor sentiment this quarter.<br/> Below you'll find a chart showing projected deal and dollar volume for this quarter and the year leading up to it.<br/> As with seed and angel rounds, both deal and dollar volume grew relative to Q1 2017, but again to varying degrees. Roughly 150 more early-stage deals were closed in Q2 relative to Q1, an increase of nearly 9 percent. These same projections show a notable 23 percent increase in the amount of capital invested, good for a $3.2 billion uptick in early-stage dollar volume globally. (Recall that dollar volume in seed and angel rounds was also up by 23 percent, quarter-over-quarter.)<br/> Looking at things on an annual basis suggests that this is an industry that's still on the mend. The dollar volume of early-stage deals in Q2 2017 is still roughly $3.2 billion, nearly 16 percent, lower than the Q2 2016 watermark. However, the number of early-stage deals from Q2 2017 was up 6 percent relative to last year, so that's one bright spot.<br/> Again with the theme of recovery and a return to sustained growth, we've charted the mean and median size of reported rounds going back to Q2 2016.<br/> Both median and average round sizes have grown over the past quarter. The average early-stage round is now $11.9 million, a 14.4 percent increase over the previous quarter. The median round, coming in at $6 million on the nose, is up 11 percent from Q1 2017.<br/> Looking at it from an annual perspective, though, Q2 2017 is something of a mixed bag. Although the median early-stage round is 20 percent larger than the first three months of 2016, the average round is still nearly 12 percent smaller. This being said, because median round sizes have consistently crept higher over time and the average size of an early-stage round is on an upward trajectory, it's entirely possible that, by the end of this quarter, these metrics will be back to where they were before the dip of late 2016.<br/> Of course, these metrics reflect the decisions of thousands of people, but some investors are more involved in the market than others. We identified the investors in nearly 1,300 early-stage rounds closed in Q2 and found more than 2,200 unique individual and institutional investors. Out of those, here are the busiest early-stage investors from Q2.<br/> Again we see many of the investors we'd expect to find here. A preliminary analysis suggests that some of the most prolific investors picked up their pace of deal-making in Q2. For example, in Q1's report, Accel Partners was reported to have invested in 11 early-stage venture rounds. But according to current data for Q2, that firm has doubled the number of rounds in which it's invested. This also holds true for NEA and GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), which invested in roughly twice the number of early-stage rounds as the previous quarter. Whether this is a seasonal phenomenon or not is unclear.<br/> And here are some of the early-stage financing events that caught our eye in the last quarter.<br/> And with seed, angel and early-stage investments covered, it's finally on to the latter end of the venture fundraising spectrum.<br/> Late-stage deals<br/> Like with early-stage deals, investment activity in late stage deals - which are primarily Series C, Series D and beyond - indicates a continued, sustained recovery from the low point of Q4 2016. In the case of these late-stage deals, we're able to assess an even larger chunk of the global VC market. In Q2 2017, late-stage deals accounted for more than 56 percent of the total dollar volume, despite being just under 7 percent of the total number of deals.<br/> Below, you can find a chart displaying late-stage dollar and deal volume according to Crunchbase's projections.<br/> It's remarkable how similar this chart looks to the one showing early-stage deal data. Just like rounds from the previous stages we analyzed, both the number and dollar volume of late-stage venture capital deals are on the rise, at least relative to the last couple of quarters.<br/> There were roughly 12 percent more late-stage deals struck in the second quarter of 2017 relative to the first. Dollar volume also is up on a quarterly basis. Projections indicate that more than 19 percent more money was invested in Q2 versus the first quarter of this year, meaning that late-stage startups around the world received roughly $4.35 billion more in investment than they did in Q1.<br/> Comparing this quarter to the second quarter of last year again shows mixed results. Like with early-stage VC, deal volume is up, but dollar volume is down. Relative to Q2 2016, projections indicate there were 9 percent more late-stage deals. However, there was roughly 4 percent less capital committed overall. Despite this, if the kind of robust quarter-over-quarter growth we've seen recently continues through Q3, the market will be left in better standing than the beginning of 2016.<br/> Now let's take a look at the internals of the late-stage VC market.<br/> Median round size is unchanged since last quarter (and, for that matter, the previous three) and the average round size is up a comparatively modest 3.5 percent from Q1 2017. Again echoing a common theme, the median late-stage round from Q2 2017 is 20 percent larger than one from Q2 2016. However, the average late-stage round is nearly 14 percent smaller than last year's average. But it's worth noting that the Q2 2016 data point appears to be a statistical outlier, perhaps caused by one or more giant late-stage rounds which Crunchbase didn't classify as \"technology growth equity.\"<br/> The average round size in Q1 2016 was $54.9 million and the average in Q3 2016 was $64 million, so it's likely that some number of very large rounds skewed Q2 2016's average much higher than the historical norm. Meanwhile, many of the most prolific late-stage investors from Q2 are also some of the most established firms in the business.<br/> And among the various late-stage deals, here are some of the ones that grabbed our attention from this quarter.<br/> We're almost done with the sector-by-sector analysis. On to the final stage: technology growth.<br/> Technology growth<br/> Technology growth capital is often referred to as \"growth equity\" in the business. Crunchbase categorizes technology growth rounds as the set of private equity rounds which also saw participation from traditional venture capital investors, often as a follow-on from previous VC rounds.<br/> The chart below shows Crunchbase's projections for deal and dollar volume in technology growth rounds.<br/> Compared to the same period last year, both deal and dollar volume are up. Crunchbase projects that there were a dozen more deals struck in Q2 2017 compared to Q2 2016, a nearly 32 percent increase. Dollar volume is up too, albeit by a more moderate 10.75 percent, which amounts to around $160 million.<br/> There's an interesting disconnect between dollar and deal volume, which is particularly apparent when you compare Q2 to Q1 of this year. Although Crunchbase projects that there were more than twice as many technology growth equity deals made in Q2 than Q1, the total amount of funding represented by these deals is 45 percent less than the previous quarter. The cause of this decline in dollar volume is likely significant declines in round sizes over time.<br/> Below, you will find a chart displaying the median and average technology growth round over time.<br/> The average size of technology growth equity rounds extended its decline from its high in Q4 2016, and the median round size is down, as well. Both measures are down 65 percent or more relative to Q1 2017. Compared to Q2 last year, the average growth equity round is nearly 23 percent larger, and the median is up by 11 percent.<br/> Money out<br/> Bullish key finding. Q2 saw a number of successful tech IPOs, quelling fears that public market investors have lost their appetite for new tech stocks.     Bearish key finding. Despite a handful of high-profile acquisitions, venture-backed M&amp;A saw one of its worst quarters in years, at least in terms of total dollar volume.<br/> Venture-backed acquisitions<br/> Acquisitions are one of two main ways venture capitalists and other private investors can liquidate their stock in the companies they fund.<br/> Below, you'll find a chart that shows venture-backed startup acquisitions over time.<br/> This chart is somewhat deceiving, especially if you were to only compare the relative level of M&amp;A activity in Q2 2017 to Q2 and Q3 of 2016. Although it's true that there were close to 15 percent fewer deals and a nearly 80 percent decline in dollar volume between Q2 2016 and Q2 2017, these quarters appear to be outliers, a point we also brought up in last quarter's report.<br/> It turns out that the middle quarters of 2016 were particularly prodigious for big tech M&amp;A deal-making. There were a number of major acquisitions that pushed global M&amp;A dollar volume much higher:<br/> Didi Chuxing acquired Uber China for $7 billion     Walmart acquired Jet.com for $3 billion     Unilever acquired Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion<br/> M&amp;A exits for venture-backed startups weren't necessarily more plentiful - in fact, there's been a slight but consistent down trend in the number of deals over the past year - but they were certainly more lucrative.<br/> All this being said, Q2 2017 was disappointing even relative to Q4 2016, which as we've mentioned was the nadir of venture capital investment. Dollar volume declined more than 66 percent, and the number of deals declined by 6.5 percent relative to the previous quarter. Although there were some notable exits, it's nonetheless been a rather sleepy quarter.<br/> Below, we've broken out a number of notable M&amp;A transactions from Q2 2017.<br/> Q2 saw a lot of consolidation in a number of industries, most notably shopping and transportation. June 16th was a fortuitous day for M&amp;A in retail. Bonobos, the online menswear retailer, announced its sale to Walmart for more than $300 million, a solid exit for its investors, which included Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nordstrom. However, that announcement was overshadowed by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, news of which broke on the same day as the Bonobos sale.<br/> On the transportation front, KKR, the large private equity firm, acquired Dutch parking company Q-Park in a multi-billion dollar deal. And Gett, the NYC-based ridesharing company aspiring to usurp Uber and Lyft, acquired its competitor, Juno, for $200 million.<br/> As we alluded to above, M&amp;A isn't the only route to liquidity for investors, founders and employees. Let's take a look at the quarter's global IPO performance.<br/> Initial public offerings<br/> Q2 2017 saw a noticeable uptick in technology IPOs in both the U.S. and Europe, helping to quiet speculation that the \"IPO window\" was closed to all but the biggest companies.<br/> Here, we broke out a number of deals from around the world that mattered most.<br/> For now, there haven't been many announcements or regulatory filings for IPOs in Q3. For now, there's only one venture-backed tech company that has announced a forthcoming offering: Seattle-based real estate search and brokerage Redfin, which filed paperwork with the SEC declaring its intention to raise $100 million. To date, Redfin has raised more than  $167 million from investors ranging from Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Tiger Global Management and others.<br/> Conclusion<br/> Although the global venture capital market is still recovering from a significant dip at the end of last year, Q2 2017 was, in general, a fairly good quarter. There's been growth in deal and dollar volume at almost all stages, except for technology growth equity, for the second consecutive quarter. Rounds are growing in size, some of the most active VCs we highlighted in Q1 have literally doubled down on their investing activity and, importantly, the total amount of venture capital funding is within reach of pre-dip levels. If the general upward trend continues, Q3 will shape up to be a real return to normal, not just another quarter of recovery.<br/> Methodology<br/> The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and in two varieties: projected data and reported data.<br/> Crunchbase uses projections for global and U.S. trend analysis. Projections are based on historical patterns in late reporting, which are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity. Using projected data helps prevent undercounting or reporting skewed trends that only correct over time. All projected values are noted accordingly.<br/> Certain metrics, like mean and median reported round sizes, were generated using only reported data. Unlike with projected data, Crunchbase calculates these kinds of metrics based only on the data it currently has. Just like with projected data, reported data will be properly indicated.<br/> Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events as reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.<br/> Glossary of funding terms<br/> Seed/Angel include financings that are classified as a seed or angel, including accelerator fundings and equity crowdfunding below $5 million.

Shared on Facebook, this warning was read by hundreds of thousands anxious to know about the threat to their neighbourhood. The fact that the 120-word story beneath it came from a small town in southern Texas called Three Rivers was irrelevant: Facebook's algorithm had made it a viral sensation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The more that people clicked and shared the tale of a smalltown fugitive, who was quickly apprehended, the more Facebook's code promoted the story to others. Thus it became the most shared post on Facebook for the first three months of the year, gaining more than 800,000 shares, ahead of lurid pro-life stories (\"You Can't Give a Lethal Injection to Murderers in New York, But You Can Give One to an Unborn Baby\") and scare stories about the now debunked \"Momo Challenge\", in which children were supposedly enticed by a online character called Momo to perform dangerous stunts.</p><p>This was a full year after Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg promised changes to the social network's news feed to prioritise \"meaningful content\" following the scandals around fake news and Russian misinformation. But when it comes down to it, the code does what it was always designed to do: it maximises \"engagement\" to bring in as much ad revenue as possible.</p><p>The Three Rivers story is a cautionary tale about the efficiency of computer code and the reluctance of the people who write it to compromise when they have created something that \"works\". The vast majority of people, who have no specialist understanding of the world of computing, are only now waking up to how much of their lives is dependent on code - dull-looking strings of characters that can change the world for good or bad.</p><p>As a new book, Coders, by Clive Thompson, illustrates, the programmers who write this stuff are the most quietly influential people on the planet. Thompson, a technology writer, believes coders' importance today is equivalent to that of the great engineers of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Code, for the uninitiated, consists of strings of words and characters, conforming to the syntax of a programming language such as Python or PHP. The code that gives your computer the step-by-step instructions to perform a task is called a program; an algorithm is the method of solving a given problem. So the same algorithm may be written in different code in different programming languages.</p><p>Since the 1970s, the first exercise given to those learning to code has been to create a program to print \"Hello, World!\" In Python, a popular programming language, you need to type in: print (\"Hello, World!\") and tap \"Enter\" to run the code and see your printout. Simple. But to new coders, according to Thompson, the effect can be \"electric and Olympian\", giving a feeling of control and endless possibilities. Write some more code and you can create a simple game. Tangle with much longer strings and you can build something like Facebook's news feed. Programs such as Microsoft Office contain about 30 million lines of code.</p><p>The algorithm is generally invisible to outsiders, protected on a company's servers by layers of cybersecurity and considered commercially sensitive. Increasingly, programmers are creating machinelearning algorithms that are even more of a \"black box\" because they can learn to perform tasks without receiving specific instructions - a form of artificial intelligence (AI), though critics believe they're still far from resembling human intelligence.</p><p>Code is mostly invisible but it is everywhere, and not only in the obvious places like our computers and mobile phones. Code went into laying out the page you are reading now, even if you are holding the print edition. The clothes you are wearing were cut by machines fed by code. Code keeps pacemakers and infant incubators running. The nuts and bolts of daily existence all depend on software which comes down to code.</p><p>And it is getting ever more important, as algorithms tackle problems that were previously left to human decisions. Already, computer programs in some overseas hospitals assess patients' scans, medical records and test results for signs of cancer. In parts of Britain, software has been used to predict who will commit crimes and to advise police on custody decisions. All of this comes with human supervision, but experts wonder for how long.</p><p>To programmers, it is obvious that code should be used to tackle more and more tasks, including those involving life and death decisions. Good code is logical and efficient, while humans are illogical and unreliable - which is why supporters claim that driverless cars will be safer than human-controlled vehicles.</p><p>But who are the coders on whom we rely so much? The most famous or arguably notorious are computer science graduates (and dropouts) from Ivy League schools who started some of the world's biggest companies in the 1990s and early 2000s. They include Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and hundreds of others influential but unknown. As their critics point out, they are mostly white men from privileged backgrounds.</p><p>There are also coders responsible for the older, duller but still influential companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Apple. And there are the 18 million-odd programmers who work for others or who run small businesses.</p><p>What makes these people tick? Coders are natural problem-solvers, who thrive on an intellectual challenge that can be gruelling. It's easy to program \"Hello, World!\" but incredibly demanding to code at a high level. As Thompson describes it: \"It requires sitting alone for hours, trying to mentally inhabit the twisty nuances of a piece of software - how this loop over here is triggered by that input by the user, unless this other sub-routine is currently running, in which case this function ought to fire up.\"</p><p>Meeting dozens of coders for his book, Thompson found that some stereotypes held true. Coders are often introverts and sometimes \"nerds\" who have found respect through their work. It's a task in which it's easy to get bogged down, which can become Sisyphean, as the author puts it, as you go back again and again to deal with bugs in your code.</p><p>There are the coders who find a job, who work diligently, wearing headphones and lost in their own world. The rock stars of coding such as the Zuckerbergs and the Pages, did things differently. They came up with a lot of big ideas and applied a simple standard of \"Does it work?\" and a philosophy expressed in Facebook's mantra of \"Move fast and break things\". In other words, no one cared about your clothes, your working hours or your off-colour comments, provided you wrote good code. And that code would be tried out continually on real-world users.</p><p>At Facebook in the early days, programmers would start work at noon; by 5pm they would go to bars to work and drink and by 11pm they would release updates of their code. \"Around 1am, we'd know either we're f***ed or we're good,\" the company's former chief security officer told Adam Fisher, for his book Valley of Genius. \"If we were good everyone would be like 'whoopee' and might be able to sleep for a little while. If we were f***ed then we were like, 'OK, now we've got to try and claw this thing back or fix it.\"</p><p>When Facebook introduced its news feed in 2006, users complained and called for it to be scrapped, with one urging: \"[It's] just too creepy, too stalker-esque\". However, engagement statistics showed that the algorithm \"worked\", the numbers added up, and so news feed stayed.</p><p>For years none of this was a problem. Services such as Amazon, Facebook and Google were new and useful to a lot of people and could be ignored by anyone else. Their founders got rich and were seen, positively, as goofy, man-boy geniuses. Rumours of a work hard, play hard \"bro\" culture, with Google's keg parties and Facebook's murals of sexy women, didn't do the firms any harm and only enhanced their reputations by reducing the nerd factor.</p><p>It is only in the past few years that unintended consequences have emerged from those heady, carefree days. \"Does it work?\" meant simply \"does it work for us, now?\" Once you are coding to try to get people to return again and again to your service, focusing singlemindedly on how to gain more clicks, \"likes\" and views, you begin to systematically manipulate them.</p><p>The negative effects of social media algorithms are now well known. Code written with the sole purpose of boosting \"engagement\" and revenues has contributed to polarisation, as people are shown stories and videos that reinforce their existing beliefs and can push them towards extremes. This has included Russian disinformation and Isis propaganda but often it is subtler and more insidious, with each story gently nudging the viewer further to the right or left.</p><p>Analysts believe that Facebook's news feed algorithm has fuelled the gilets jaunes protests in France by showing people unreliable anti-government news coverage from outlets such as Russia's RT.</p><p>Arguably Google and Facebook contributed to the radicalisation of the Christchurch shooting suspect Brenton Tarrant, who shared videos from Google's YouTube platform on his Facebook page. To the coders behind the companies, their world was computers, not publishing. So they shirked their responsibility and have only made grudging changes when forced to by pressure from media groups and politicians.</p><p>Another problem of a world of which coders are the architects is data. To do its job of giving users what they want 24/7, the social media algorithm needs as much information about us as possible. From this has sprung the wholesale surveillance of social media users and last year's Cambridge Analytica scandal, whereby Facebook failed to protect the data it had gathered on millions of its customers. Then there are the monopolies. Unchecked for so long, these companies exploited the power of their algorithms to acquire billions of users and billions in revenues with which to buy startups and dominate next-generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>It isn't only social media companies that have used code in controversial ways. Uber, the ride-sharing firm, was widely considered a company out of control under its former chief executive Travis Kalanick, as programmers used their technical skills to spy on customers and sabotage rival firms.</p><p>Bias is a near-universal problem in computing and often algorithms are racist or sexist. In the US, organisations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have criticised algorithms used in bail decisions as being biased against black people. The algorithms assign risk scores to people based on factors such as prior arrests. If black people have more prior arrests due to human bias, the machine assigns them higher risk scores. This may reflect social prejudice but critics believe that the problem is compounded by the lack of diversity in tech because privileged white men are less likely to care about the problems faced by other groups.</p><p>Most coders remain as unseen as the code they write. Where they become famous or notorious, their cases shed a light on the industry.</p><p>The engineer James Damore was sacked from Google two years ago after he shared a memo with colleagues arguing that there were fewer women than men in coding because of innate biological differences. Women form 30 per cent of Google's workforce and 25 per cent of the leadership roles. Damore's memo was defended by some scientists. However, women in the industry said that his comments reflected deep bias and a working environment that could be hostile to women as well as ethnic minorities.</p><p>A British coder who made headlines was Marcus Hutchins who, aged 23, halted the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack by North Korea that brought parts of the NHS to a standstill two years ago. He was later arrested by the FBI for hacking offences allegedly committed years beforehand. He is awaiting trial in California and denies wrongdoing. Coders can easily be drawn into the dark side of hacking and cybercrime because it offers the intellectual challenge they crave with the added frisson of illegality.</p><p>Clive Thompson had an insight into how programming can corrupt while learning to code as part of the research for his book: \"Spend enough time in a world where pure logic and rigorous structure reign; where persuasion doesn't work, and can't, and you can wind up developing habits of mind that feel half machine.\" Excelling in programming, he says, can lead to a \"dangerous confidence\" and \"epic hubris\".</p><p>Equally it can lead to idealism. The book offers hope by looking at some programmers who are trying to tackle the problems in big tech and do things a different way. Ruchi Sanghvi, who helped to write Facebook's news feed algorithm and was criticised as \"aggressive\" by her loud male colleagues for standing up for herself, has founded South Park Commons, a \"collective of technologists, tinkerers and entrepreneurs who have come together to freely learn, explore new ideas and help each other launch our next venture\". Among its achievements, the collective has helped six startups founded by women.</p><p>There are other positive signs. Thompson believes that growing demand for programmers will increase diversity in the industry, even if some of those from less privileged backgrounds are limited to positions as \"blue-collar coders\". The teaching of coding in schools should also help to broaden the industry. It has been on the curriculum in Britain for five years and more parents are sending their children to coding boot camps. They are likely to give more children an interest in programming that could encourage them to enrol on schemes such as CyberFirst, which is backed by GCHQ.</p><p>Still, Thompson concludes that only \"deep structural change\" can alter the trajectory of big tech. That means businesses diversifying their workforces, investors changing their priorities and social networks getting away from advertising-based business models where, above all else, the algorithm needs to grab people's attention.</p><p>For now, with billions of pounds of ad revenues at stake and a lack of proper regulation by government, that appears like wishful thinking.</p><p>Mark Bridge is technology correspondent</p><p>Once you are coding to try to get people to return again and again to your service, you begin to systematically manipulate your users \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook's news feed has been blamed for stoking unrest - such as the gilets jaunes protests in France - by serving users a diet of biased coverage.

Shared on Facebook, this warning was read by hundreds of thousands anxious to know about the threat to their neighbourhood. The fact that the 120-word story beneath it came from a small town in southern Texas called Three Rivers was irrelevant: Facebook's algorithm had made it a viral sensation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The more that people clicked and shared the tale of a smalltown fugitive, who was quickly apprehended, the more Facebook's code promoted the story to others. Thus it became the most shared post on Facebook for the first three months of the year, gaining more than 800,000 shares, ahead of lurid pro-life stories (\"You Can't Give a Lethal Injection to Murderers in New York, But You Can Give One to an Unborn Baby\") and scare stories about the now debunked \"Momo Challenge\", in which children were supposedly enticed by a online character called Momo to perform dangerous stunts.</p><p>This was a full year after Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg promised changes to the social network's news feed to prioritise \"meaningful content\" following the scandals around fake news and Russian misinformation. But when it comes down to it, the code does what it was always designed to do: it maximises \"engagement\" to bring in as much ad revenue as possible.</p><p>The Three Rivers story is a cautionary tale about the efficiency of computer code and the reluctance of the people who write it to compromise when they have created something that \"works\". The vast majority of people, who have no specialist understanding of the world of computing, are only now waking up to how much of their lives is dependent on code - dull-looking strings of characters that can change the world for good or bad.</p><p>As a new book, Coders, by Clive Thompson, illustrates, the programmers who write this stuff are the most quietly influential people on the planet. Thompson, a technology writer, believes coders' importance today is equivalent to that of the great engineers of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Code, for the uninitiated, consists of strings of words and characters, conforming to the syntax of a programming language such as Python or PHP. The code that gives your computer the step-by-step instructions to perform a task is called a program; an algorithm is the method of solving a given problem. So the same algorithm may be written in different code in different programming languages.</p><p>Since the 1970s, the first exercise given to those learning to code has been to create a program to print \"Hello, World!\" In Python, a popular programming language, you need to type in: print (\"Hello, World!\") and tap \"Enter\" to run the code and see your printout. Simple. But to new coders, according to Thompson, the effect can be \"electric and Olympian\", giving a feeling of control and endless possibilities. Write some more code and you can create a simple game. Tangle with much longer strings and you can build something like Facebook's news feed. Programs such as Microsoft Office contain about 30 million lines of code.</p><p>The algorithm is generally invisible to outsiders, protected on a company's servers by layers of cybersecurity and considered commercially sensitive. Increasingly, programmers are creating machinelearning algorithms that are even more of a \"black box\" because they can learn to perform tasks without receiving specific instructions - a form of artificial intelligence (AI), though critics believe they're still far from resembling human intelligence.</p><p>Code is mostly invisible but it is everywhere, and not only in the obvious places like our computers and mobile phones. Code went into laying out the page you are reading now, even if you are holding the print edition. The clothes you are wearing were cut by machines fed by code. Code keeps pacemakers and infant incubators running. The nuts and bolts of daily existence all depend on software which comes down to code.</p><p>And it is getting ever more important, as algorithms tackle problems that were previously left to human decisions. Already, computer programs in some overseas hospitals assess patients' scans, medical records and test results for signs of cancer. In parts of Britain, software has been used to predict who will commit crimes and to advise police on custody decisions. All of this comes with human supervision, but experts wonder for how long.</p><p>To programmers, it is obvious that code should be used to tackle more and more tasks, including those involving life and death decisions. Good code is logical and efficient, while humans are illogical and unreliable - which is why supporters claim that driverless cars will be safer than human-controlled vehicles.</p><p>But who are the coders on whom we rely so much? The most famous or arguably notorious are computer science graduates (and dropouts) from Ivy League schools who started some of the world's biggest companies in the 1990s and early 2000s. They include Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and hundreds of others influential but unknown. As their critics point out, they are mostly white men from privileged backgrounds.</p><p>There are also coders responsible for the older, duller but still influential companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Apple. And there are the 18 million-odd programmers who work for others or who run small businesses.</p><p>What makes these people tick? Coders are natural problem-solvers, who thrive on an intellectual challenge that can be gruelling. It's easy to program \"Hello, World!\" but incredibly demanding to code at a high level. As Thompson describes it: \"It requires sitting alone for hours, trying to mentally inhabit the twisty nuances of a piece of software - how this loop over here is triggered by that input by the user, unless this other sub-routine is currently running, in which case this function ought to fire up.\"</p><p>Meeting dozens of coders for his book, Thompson found that some stereotypes held true. Coders are often introverts and sometimes \"nerds\" who have found respect through their work. It's a task in which it's easy to get bogged down, which can become Sisyphean, as the author puts it, as you go back again and again to deal with bugs in your code.</p><p>There are the coders who find a job, who work diligently, wearing headphones and lost in their own world. The rock stars of coding such as the Zuckerbergs and the Pages, did things differently. They came up with a lot of big ideas and applied a simple standard of \"Does it work?\" and a philosophy expressed in Facebook's mantra of \"Move fast and break things\". In other words, no one cared about your clothes, your working hours or your off-colour comments, provided you wrote good code. And that code would be tried out continually on real-world users.</p><p>At Facebook in the early days, programmers would start work at noon; by 5pm they would go to bars to work and drink and by 11pm they would release updates of their code. \"Around 1am, we'd know either we're f***ed or we're good,\" the company's former chief security officer told Adam Fisher, for his book Valley of Genius. \"If we were good everyone would be like 'whoopee' and might be able to sleep for a little while. If we were f***ed then we were like, 'OK, now we've got to try and claw this thing back or fix it.\"</p><p>When Facebook introduced its news feed in 2006, users complained and called for it to be scrapped, with one urging: \"[It's] just too creepy, too stalker-esque\". However, engagement statistics showed that the algorithm \"worked\", the numbers added up, and so news feed stayed.</p><p>For years none of this was a problem. Services such as Amazon, Facebook and Google were new and useful to a lot of people and could be ignored by anyone else. Their founders got rich and were seen, positively, as goofy, man-boy geniuses. Rumours of a work hard, play hard \"bro\" culture, with Google's keg parties and Facebook's murals of sexy women, didn't do the firms any harm and only enhanced their reputations by reducing the nerd factor.</p><p>It is only in the past few years that unintended consequences have emerged from those heady, carefree days. \"Does it work?\" meant simply \"does it work for us, now?\" Once you are coding to try to get people to return again and again to your service, focusing singlemindedly on how to gain more clicks, \"likes\" and views, you begin to systematically manipulate them.</p><p>The negative effects of social media algorithms are now well known. Code written with the sole purpose of boosting \"engagement\" and revenues has contributed to polarisation, as people are shown stories and videos that reinforce their existing beliefs and can push them towards extremes. This has included Russian disinformation and Isis propaganda but often it is subtler and more insidious, with each story gently nudging the viewer further to the right or left.</p><p>Analysts believe that Facebook's news feed algorithm has fuelled the gilets jaunes protests in France by showing people unreliable anti-government news coverage from outlets such as Russia's RT.</p><p>Arguably Google and Facebook contributed to the radicalisation of the Christchurch shooting suspect Brenton Tarrant, who shared videos from Google's YouTube platform on his Facebook page. To the coders behind the companies, their world was computers, not publishing. So they shirked their responsibility and have only made grudging changes when forced to by pressure from media groups and politicians.</p><p>Another problem of a world of which coders are the architects is data. To do its job of giving users what they want 24/7, the social media algorithm needs as much information about us as possible. From this has sprung the wholesale surveillance of social media users and last year's Cambridge Analytica scandal, whereby Facebook failed to protect the data it had gathered on millions of its customers. Then there are the monopolies. Unchecked for so long, these companies exploited the power of their algorithms to acquire billions of users and billions in revenues with which to buy startups and dominate next-generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>It isn't only social media companies that have used code in controversial ways. Uber, the ride-sharing firm, was widely considered a company out of control under its former chief executive Travis Kalanick, as programmers used their technical skills to spy on customers and sabotage rival firms.</p><p>Bias is a near-universal problem in computing and often algorithms are racist or sexist. In the US, organisations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have criticised algorithms used in bail decisions as being biased against black people. The algorithms assign risk scores to people based on factors such as prior arrests. If black people have more prior arrests due to human bias, the machine assigns them higher risk scores. This may reflect social prejudice but critics believe that the problem is compounded by the lack of diversity in tech because privileged white men are less likely to care about the problems faced by other groups.</p><p>Most coders remain as unseen as the code they write. Where they become famous or notorious, their cases shed a light on the industry.</p><p>The engineer James Damore was sacked from Google two years ago after he shared a memo with colleagues arguing that there were fewer women than men in coding because of innate biological differences. Women form 30 per cent of Google's workforce and 25 per cent of the leadership roles. Damore's memo was defended by some scientists. However, women in the industry said that his comments reflected deep bias and a working environment that could be hostile to women as well as ethnic minorities.</p><p>A British coder who made headlines was Marcus Hutchins who, aged 23, halted the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack by North Korea that brought parts of the NHS to a standstill two years ago. He was later arrested by the FBI for hacking offences allegedly committed years beforehand. He is awaiting trial in California and denies wrongdoing. Coders can easily be drawn into the dark side of hacking and cybercrime because it offers the intellectual challenge they crave with the added frisson of illegality.</p><p>Clive Thompson had an insight into how programming can corrupt while learning to code as part of the research for his book: \"Spend enough time in a world where pure logic and rigorous structure reign; where persuasion doesn't work, and can't, and you can wind up developing habits of mind that feel half machine.\" Excelling in programming, he says, can lead to a \"dangerous confidence\" and \"epic hubris\".</p><p>Equally it can lead to idealism. The book offers hope by looking at some programmers who are trying to tackle the problems in big tech and do things a different way. Ruchi Sanghvi, who helped to write Facebook's news feed algorithm and was criticised as \"aggressive\" by her loud male colleagues for standing up for herself, has founded South Park Commons, a \"collective of technologists, tinkerers and entrepreneurs who have come together to freely learn, explore new ideas and help each other launch our next venture\". Among its achievements, the collective has helped six startups founded by women.</p><p>There are other positive signs. Thompson believes that growing demand for programmers will increase diversity in the industry, even if some of those from less privileged backgrounds are limited to positions as \"blue-collar coders\". The teaching of coding in schools should also help to broaden the industry. It has been on the curriculum in Britain for five years and more parents are sending their children to coding boot camps. They are likely to give more children an interest in programming that could encourage them to enrol on schemes such as CyberFirst, which is backed by GCHQ.</p><p>Still, Thompson concludes that only \"deep structural change\" can alter the trajectory of big tech. That means businesses diversifying their workforces, investors changing their priorities and social networks getting away from advertising-based business models where, above all else, the algorithm needs to grab people's attention.</p><p>For now, with billions of pounds of ad revenues at stake and a lack of proper regulation by government, that appears like wishful thinking.</p><p>Mark Bridge is technology correspondent</p><p>Once you are coding to try to get people to return again and again to your service, you begin to systematically manipulate your users \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook's news feed has been blamed for stoking unrest - such as the gilets jaunes protests in France - by serving users a diet of biased coverage.

The dress code demanded white shirts, khaki trousers and black helmets. \"Look good,\" organisers of the Unite the Right march told them. \"Dress in a way that's flattering, not in a way that makes you look like a clown... If your appearance is seriously lacking (morbidly obese, disfigured etc) please do not go to the rally.\" Masks, Ku Klux Klan hats and Nazi symbols were out; shields were preferred to knives as they signified defence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The far right, Julia Ebner explains in this riveting and often deeply disturbing book, is obsessed with image. The brand they tirelessly promote, though, is \"we versus them\". Women in the movement no longer conform to oldfashioned gender stereotypes: now it is all mini-skirts, hoodies, exercise regimens and Instagram accounts. Fashion and lifestyle are gateways to their nefarious views, helping modern extremist movements draw in younger supporters. This isn't exclusive to the far right, either. \"Isis,\" Ebner writes, \"has modelled itself as a cool counter-culture... brand that resists mainstream thinking while still adhering to the latest cultural touchstones.\"</p><p>The author is a counterextremism expert who works at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. She spends her days briefing national intelligence units and directing social-media sites on the removal of white supremacist material. This book explores her extracurricular activities, going undercover and adopting five different online identities to investigate jihadis, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, radical misogynists and Christian fundamentalists. \"During my working hours I was the cat,\" she notes, \"but in my spare time I joined the mice.\"</p><p>Technology has put a rocket under these movements again. Extremist leaders create hidden online communities to stoke antisocial behaviour in the wider world. They use technology to amplify their message, such as the terrorist in New Zealand last year who live-streamed his murderous mosque rampages. They use it as a weapon: in 2018, Hamas created a fake dating app to target Israel Defense Forces soldiers with malicious software hiding behind women's profiles. And they use it to spread misinformation: hardline Brexit campaigns were aided by QAnon, a conspiracy-theory site.</p><p>Ebner ventures into these virtual dystopias of hate storms and trolling armies, into messenger groups of jihadi brides and onto white supremacist dating sites. The parts she seems most disturbed by, though, are the forums where women are brainwashed into being submissive \"trad wives\".</p><p>Their proponents claim all women have a \"sexual market value\" determined by health, age, femininity and chastity - personality be damned. In this warped world view, women are supposed to surrender, to take the blame when they are verbally abused. Heartbreakingly, Ebner writes, most \"trad wives\" are radicalised by the search for love.</p><p>Her investigation crosses into the physical world, too: she visits a neo-Nazi rock festival in Ostritz, Germany, and an Airbnb in Brixton, London, where Generation Identity, a European far right group aimed at the young, is hosting an event for new recruits. Her aim is to expose the way extremist groups manipulate their members in the hope that this will prevent others from being radicalised by them. Her book is a call, too, for policy-makers to rethink their response to extremism, arguing for a holistic approach that focuses on individuals, rather than simply on laws and regulations.</p><p>Neo-Nazi groups especially have developed a canny digital strategy. In their forums and chat rooms, there are insider jokes and taboobreaking humour to draw in a young audience seeking a sense of belonging. The far right appropriates and weaponises pop culture, from Taylor Swift to Japanese anime. The Matrix science fiction trilogy is a particular gold mine, with its premise that humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality; the far right argues that we are all similarly being misled about the world, and we need to take their \"red pill\" to see it. Red pills are lies presented as truths by the far right: their ultimate red pill is that the Holocaust never happened.</p><p>As Ebner sets out, the far right's aim is to enter the mainstream. White supremacist chat rooms might trumpet the words \"race war now\", but they pass themselves off as champions of free speech. Their bid to shift the Overton window, the range of ideas deemed acceptable, appears to be working. Men Among the Ruins, a work by the Italian philosopher Julius Evola that they draw upon, was cited by Donald Trump's former political adviser Steve Bannon. At Charlottesville, where the civil-rights activist Heather Heyer was killed, the president later claimed there were \"very fine people on both sides\".</p><p>Ebner isn't quite despairing about all this. At the end, she offers 10 solutions that straddle big tech, politics and civil society to address extremism, including the creation of internet \"elves\" to combat the trolls. What she never fully sets out is how big these movements are: are they niche elements, or sprouting up next door? Yet this book still feels like a punch to the stomach: these pernicious creeds are lurking in the darkest recesses of the internet, waiting to come out into the light. c</p><p>The far right's aim is to enter the mainstream</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Extremism A KKK member at the fatal rally in Virginia, 2017</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-157477065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y72-R5H1-DYTY-C2FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Control &amp;

Heartbreakingly, Ebner writes, most \"trad wives\" are radicalised by the search for love.</p><p>Her investigation crosses into the physical world, too: she visits a neo-Nazi rock festival in Ostritz, Germany, and an Airbnb in Brixton, London, where Generation Identity, a European far right group aimed at the young, is hosting an event for new recruits. Her aim is to expose the way extremist groups manipulate their members in the hope that this will prevent others from being radicalised by them. Her book is a call, too, for policy-makers to rethink their response to extremism, arguing for a holistic approach that focuses on individuals, rather than simply on laws and regulations.</p><p>Neo-Nazi groups especially have developed a canny digital strategy. In their forums and chat rooms, there are insider jokes and taboobreaking humour to draw in a young audience seeking a sense of belonging. The far right appropriates and weaponises pop culture, from Taylor Swift to Japanese anime. The Matrix science fiction trilogy is a particular gold mine, with its premise that humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality; the far right argues that we are all similarly being misled about the world, and we need to take their \"red pill\" to see it. Red pills are lies presented as truths by the far right: their ultimate red pill is that the Holocaust never happened.</p><p>As Ebner sets out, the far right's aim is to enter the mainstream. White supremacist chat rooms might trumpet the words \"race war now\", but they pass themselves off as champions of free speech. Their bid to shift the Overton window, the range of ideas deemed acceptable, appears to be working. Men Among the Ruins, a work by the Italian philosopher Julius Evola that they draw upon, was cited by Donald Trump's former political adviser Steve Bannon. At Charlottesville, where the civil-rights activist Heather Heyer was killed, the president later claimed there were \"very fine people on both sides\".</p><p>Ebner isn't quite despairing about all this. At the end, she offers 10 solutions that straddle big tech, politics and civil society to address extremism, including the creation of internet \"elves\" to combat the trolls. What she never fully sets out is how big these movements are: are they niche elements, or sprouting up next door? Yet this book still feels like a punch to the stomach: these pernicious creeds are lurking in the darkest recesses of the internet, waiting to come out into the light. c</p><p>The far right's aim is to enter the mainstream</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Extremism A KKK member at the fatal rally in Virginia, 2017</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-157477953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y72-R5H1-DYTY-C1Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Control &amp;

Last fall, Intuit's longtime CEO Brad Smith embarked on a farewell tour of the company's offices around the world. Smith had presided over 11 years of explosive growth, a period when Intuit had secured its place in the Silicon Valley pantheon, and the tour was like a long party. </p><p>In Ontario, employees wore T-shirts with Smith's quasi-spiritual sayings: 'Do whatever makes your heart beat fastest' and 'Repetition doesn't ruin the prayer.' In Bangalore, India, workers put on Smith face masks as they posed for selfies with the man himself. Fittingly, the tour culminated in San Diego, the home of TurboTax, the software that transformed the company's fortunes. There, Smith arrived at his party in a DeLorean, and as he walked a red carpet, cheering employees waved 'Brad is Rad' signs. To Smith's delight, his favorite rock star, Gene Simmons of Kiss, emerged. The two posed for pictures, Simmons clad in black and the beaming CEO flashing the 'rock on' hand sign. Intuit began in the 1980s as an accounting software company focused on helping people with their bookkeeping. Over time, the company, like the other giants of Big Tech, cultivated an image of being not just good at what it did, but good, period. In a recent Super Bowl ad, Intuit portrayed itself as a gentle robot that liberates small-business owners from paperwork. The company stresses values above all, urging employees to 'deliver awesome' and pursue 'integrity without compromise.'

Intuit's QuickBooks accounting product remains a steady moneymaker, but in the past two decades TurboTax, its tax preparation product, has driven the company's steadily growing profits and made it a Wall Street phenom. When Smith took over in 2008, TurboTax was a market leader, but only a small portion of Americans filed their taxes online. By 2019, nearly 40% of U.S. taxpayers filed online and some 40 million of them did so with TurboTax, far more than with any other product. But the success of TurboTax rests on a shaky foundation, one that could collapse overnight if the U.S. government did what most wealthy countries did long ago and made tax filing simple and free for most citizens. For more than 20 years, Intuit has waged a sophisticated, sometimes covert war to prevent the government from doing just that, according to internal company and IRS documents and interviews with insiders. The company unleashed a battalion of lobbyists and hired top officials from the agency that regulates it. From the beginning, Intuit recognized that its success depended on two parallel missions: stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington. Indeed, employees ruefully joke that the company's motto should actually be 'compromise without integrity.' Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting 'encroachment,' Intuit's catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier \u2014 such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people's returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. 'For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,' reads a confidential 2007 PowerPoint[6] presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company's 2014-15 plan included manufacturing '3rd-party grass roots' support[7]. 'Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,' one internal PowerPoint slide states. The centerpiece of Intuit's anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system. Since Free File's launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program's reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has reported[8], Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find. Twelve years ago, Intuit launched its own 'free' product: the similarly named 'Free Edition' of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of 'free' into paying, some more than $200. Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for 'free' prep remains core to the company's growth. Recently, it launched a 'free, free free free' ad campaign for the Free Edition, including a crossword[9] puzzle in The New York Times in which the answer to every clue was 'f-r-e-e.' Intuit knows it's deceiving its customers, internal company documents obtained by ProPublica show. 'The website lists Free, Free, Free and the customers are assuming their return will be free,' said a company PowerPoint presentation that reported the results of an analysis of customer calls this year. 'Customers are getting upset.' An internal Intuit analysis of customer calls this year shows widespread customer confusion about ads for 'free' TurboTax. (Highlights added by ProPublica.) Intuit also continues to use 'dark patterns'[10] \u2014 design tricks to get users of its website to do things they don't necessarily mean to do \u2014 to ensure that as many customers as possible pay, former employees say. A marketing concept frequently invoked at Intuit, which goes by the acronym 'FUD,' seeks to tap into Americans' fear, uncertainty and doubt about the tax filing process. An Intuit spokesman declined to answer ProPublica's detailed questions about its efforts to fend off a government filing system, but he provided a statement. 'We empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, which includes being in charge of their own tax preparation,' he said, adding that a 'government-run pre-filled tax preparation system that makes the tax collector (who is also the investigator, auditor and enforcer) the tax preparer is fraught with conflicts of interest.' The IRS is seemingly the biggest threat to Intuit and other commercial tax prep businesses, but it has more frequently acted as the industry's ally, defending the Free File program even in the face of critical internal reviews. The IRS declined to comment for this article. The consequences of Intuit's efforts affect a huge proportion of the taxpaying public. Americans spend an estimated 1.7 billion hours and $31 billion doing their taxes each year. Just 2.8 million participated in the Free File program this year, down from 5.1 million at the program's peak in 2005. Intuit's success has made the men who run the company rich. Smith, the CEO who stepped down last year and is now executive board chair, had a stake worth $20 million when he became chief executive. It ballooned to $220 million by last year. Co-founder Scott Cook is now among the country's wealthiest people, his fortune soaring to $3.3 billion. Intuit CEO Brad Smith flashes the 'rock on' hand sign next to Kiss' Gene Simmons during Smith's 2018 farewell tour at TurboTax in San Diego. (Rachael Marie Photography) This year, Intuit was close to realizing a long-held goal: enshrining the Free File program in law, effectively closing the door on the IRS ever creating a free tax filing system. But an outcry followed ProPublica's reporting on the matter and Intuit's treatment of its customers, prompting the provision to be dropped[11] and state and federal[12] investigations[13] into Intuit's practices. Yet even after this setback, the company remained steadfastly confident that its clout in Washington would win the day. 'What we're not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do,' said Sasan Goodarzi, the new CEO, in a video released to staff this May and obtained by ProPublica. 'We are actually working with the IRS and members of the Congress to ensure that the facts are very clear.' Intuit has dominated the tax software market since 1993, when for $225 million, it bought Chipsoft, the San Diego-based company that had created TurboTax. Even then, TurboTax was the most popular option, but Intuit pursued a plan of aggressive growth. The product necessarily came on a disk, and by the end of the 1990s TurboTax boxes were nearly ubiquitous, on shelves in office supply stores across America. As internet speeds increased and dot-com mania took hold, it became apparent that Intuit's future was not in a box on a shelf. It was online. The prospect of TurboTax's growth was vast for another reason. As late as 2001, around 45 million Americans still filled out their tax forms on paper. For Intuit, those were all potential customers. But Intuit wasn't alone in seeing possibilities in the spread of high-speed internet. In Washington, lawmakers began pushing the IRS to modernize and get more taxpayers to file electronically. It was a no-brainer: Filing taxes online would be easier, and the IRS would save staff costs on processing paper returns. The danger to Intuit's growing business was obvious. If the government succeeded in creating a system that allowed the vast majority of taxpayers to file online for free, TurboTax profits would plummet. Intuit recognized that the notion of 'return-free filing' was not going away on its own. And so in 1998, the company hired Bernie McKay, a onetime Carter administration aide and a senior lobbyist at AT...to be its vice president for corporate affairs. Intuit executives like to talk about having a 'customer obsession' in developing their products. McKay's obsession is stopping government encroachment. Known to physically bang the table to drive home a point, McKay's style is 'aggressive to the point of offense,' said one fellow tax prep lobbyist. An Intuit spokesman said, 'This mischaracterization of Mr. McKay is pure fiction.' McKay, for his part, when asked at a recent tax industry conference which Star Wars character he is, responded, 'Darth Vader.' The year McKay was hired, Congress passed a major overhaul of the IRS. The bill, reflecting Intuit's lobbying, said that the IRS 'should cooperate with and encourage the private sector' to increase electronic filing. While McKay came through in his first big test, in 2002, the company found itself up against an unexpected foe, the George W. Bush administration. The threat came from a broad administration initiative to upgrade government technology. One of the proposals called for the IRS to develop 'an easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online.' Without such an option, taxpayers were stuck either filing on paper or, to file electronically, paying a tax professional or software company like TurboTax. Providing an alternative would be an obvious improvement, said Mark Forman, an official at the Office of Management and Budget who led the 'e-government' program. The technology wasn't all that complicated, and creating a free, automated filing system would help tens of millions of Americans. 'This was seen as a low-cost, high-payoff initiative,' Forman recalled in a recent interview with ProPublica. Standing in the way, he said, was an industry 'that lives off the complexity of the tax code.' Intuit revved its new lobbying machine. Even before the OMB report was publicly released, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by TurboTax's hometown congressman, wrote to the agency arguing that there was no reason for the government to 'compete' with the 'well-established' private tax prep companies. Intuit's lobbyists also went above the OMB and pressed their case directly to the White House, Forman recalled. At the IRS, 'all hell broke loose,' remembered Terry Lutes, who was then the head of electronic filing at the agency. Intuit's clout on the Hill meant that lawmakers were soon accusing the IRS of making 'secret plans to undercut the industry,' Lutes said. The agency ran the risk of seeing its funding cut if it were to pursue the Bush plan. The IRS commissioner at the time, Charles Rossotti, also opposed the idea. The IRS' customer service staff, already too thin to respond adequately to Americans' questions about the tax code, would have to grow substantially to handle millions of software queries. Congress 'will never give you sufficient funding,' Rossotti told ProPublica. So the IRS felt caught in the middle. The question became, Lutes said, 'Is there some way to come out of this with something for taxpayers that addresses the administration's objective and at the same time is acceptable to industry?' Intuit, it turned out, did have a way. Since 1999, as part of the company's strategy to head off encroachment, TurboTax had been offering free tax prep to the poorest filers.It was a program that served to bolster the company's arguments that government intervention was unnecessary. This became the basis for a deal. The industry would offer free tax prep to a larger portion of taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS would promise not to develop its own system. Intuit organized a coalition of tax prep companies under the name the Free File Alliance, and after negotiations with the IRS, the group agreed to provide free federal filing to 60% of taxpayers, or about 78 million people at the time. Government officials touted the solution as a marvel of public and private cooperation. Americans would get free tax prep, and it would cost the government almost nothing. For Intuit, it was the culmination of years of lobbying. The IRS had signed a contract that said it 'will not compete with the [Free File Alliance] in providing free, online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers.' What's more, 'free' wasn't as unprofitable as it sounded. The alliance, guided by a lawyer who was also an Intuit lobbyist, won a series of concessions that made the program palatable to industry. Free File only required the companies to offer free federal returns. They could charge for other products. The state return was the most common, but they could also pitch loans, 'audit defense' or even products that had nothing to do with taxes. Free File had another bright side: The companies could tailor their Free File offers so that they didn't cut into their base of paying customers. The agreement said the industry had to offer free federal services to at least 60% of taxpayers, but each company individually only had to cover 10% of taxpayers. Intuit and the others were free to limit their offers of free tax prep by age, income or state. There was little incentive for the companies to publicize a free alternative to their paid products, and the IRS agreed that the Free File offers need only be listed on a special page of the agency's website. For Intuit, it was a major victory in the war against encroachment. The company could now focus on turning whatever new customers it acquired through the program into paying users, both that year and in the future. The first year of Free File was 2003, and for Intuit, things went well. On paper, the Free File Alliance was a collection of 17 companies, all of them vying to serve the American taxpayer. But in reality, it was a group made up of two giants and a bunch of gnats. Intuit's only significant competitor was H...lock, and even it was a distant second. The rest of the alliance consisted mostly of tiny companies with names like Free1040TaxReturns.com. As a result, Intuit could tailor its Free File offer just the way it wanted.; But the next year, Intuit began to lose control of its creation. A scrappy competitor, TaxAct, decided to use Free File to stand out. The company decided it would try to pick up as many new customers as possible and then charge them for ancillary services. Instead of following Intuit's lead and constraining its offer to a subset of low-income taxpayers, TaxAct went the opposite direction. 'Why not go for an offer that's much simpler to understand?' is how Lance Dunn, the president of the maker of TaxAct, described[14] the strategy in a later court hearing. It began advertising a pitch for 'free federal online tax preparation and e-filing for all taxpayers. No restrictions. Everyone qualifies.' TurboTax's offer on the Free File page, meanwhile, was more difficult to parse: 'if you are eligible for EIC, are age 22 or younger, age 62 or older, or active Military with a W2.' (EIC stood for the Earned Income Tax Credit.) TaxAct's ploy was a smashing success. The company's volume exploded. Alarmed, Intuit tried to get the other companies not to offer their products for free to too many potential customers, according[15] to Dunn. Such a request could be collusion, a violation of antitrust law, Dunn said. 'Intuit asked the Free File Alliance members that we should restrict offers, which I believe is probably not legal for that group to restrain trade,' he said. ProPublica asked Intuit about Dunn's accusation, but the company did not respond. Dunn, who declined to speak with ProPublica, made these remarks during sworn testimony in 2011. The hearing was part of an antitrust case by the Justice Department against H...lock after it tried to buy TaxAct. The U.S. argued that, by eliminating a competitor, the merger would create a duopoly of Intuit and H...lock. Although the Justice Department ultimately blocked that takeover, the market has grown even more consolidated in recent years. In 2019, according to a ProPublica analysis of IRS data, the two giants accounted for 81% of all individual returns filed using tax prep software. On the defensive, Intuit and H...lock matched TaxAct's 'no restrictions' offer on Free File. Americans rushed to file for free, and in 2005, 5 million people filed their taxes through the program. Free File had become the most popular way to file taxes online. Intuit viewed the popularity of Free File as a serious threat and took its case to Congress. That year, Brad Smith, then a senior vice president at the company and head of TurboTax, told a House committee that 'the current Free File Alliance program has drifted very far from its original public service purpose and objective,' as he put it. The program wasn't supposed to be for everyone, he said: It was for the 'disadvantaged, underprivileged and underserved taxpayer populations.' Intuit's arguments quickly gained traction at the IRS. Already, in March 2005, the IRS had written to the Justice Department for legal advice on modifying the Free File program. The agency wanted to know: Would it run afoul of antitrust laws if the IRS barred companies in the Free File Alliance from offering a free product to everyone? The Justice Department responded in a May 2005 letter[16]. Clearly, wrote Renata Hesse, an antitrust section chief at the department, 'any agreement among Alliance members to restrict such free service is likely a form of price fixing' and thus illegal. But there was still a way for Intuit to get what it wanted. She wrote that if the IRS itself were to impose such a restriction, it would be legal. The IRS swooped in to beat back Intuit's competition, doing for Intuit what the company could not on its own. Despite just 5 million Americans using a program that was purportedly available to 80 million, the IRS agreed that Free File needed to be reined in. A confidential presentation for Intuit's board showed how the company, over a decade, beat back attempts to make tax filing easier. The agency made its reasoning clear in a previously unreported letter sent to the Free File Alliance the following year. Bert DuMars, then head of electronic filing at the IRS, wrote[17] that there'd been a huge jump in people using Free File in 2005, but no corresponding boom in people paying for tax prep. 'If this trend continued, the IRS was concerned that it could cause many vendors to go out of business,' he wrote. Stock market analysts, he pointed out, had said Free File 'represented a threat to future revenues and profits of the publicly traded company participants.' The IRS decided to remove this threat. The new agreement, struck between the IRS and the alliance in 2005, gave Intuit what it had sought. Companies were now expressly barred from offering free tax prep to everyone through the program. Instead, only taxpayers under an income cap, then $50,000 a year, would be eligible. On paper, the program's eligibility had actually increased to 70% of taxpayers, or about 93 million households, up from the previous 78 million. But in practice, because broad, easy-to-understand offers were now barred, it was clear the program's use would decline. Intuit had again bent the power of the federal government in its favor. After 2005, the Free File program was never again as popular, eventually falling to about half that year's level. With the threat of government encroachment on ice and high-speed internet access proliferating in the mid-2000s, Intuit looked forward to steady growth and big profits. The upside of the online software business was huge, with the cost of producing each additional unit approaching zero. And TurboTax was hardly a niche product: Intuit executives still excitedly talk about the TAM, total available market, of TurboTax as every single tax filer in the country, now over 150 million households. But TaxAct's Free File gambit had forever transformed the industry. Advertising 'free' was a great lure, so TaxAct took the battle to a different venue. Barred from making a free offer to everyone through Free File on the IRS' website, TaxAct decided to make the offer on its own website in 2006. Intuit recognized a credible challenge from the upstart and countered the next year, launching TurboTax Free Edition on its website. Confusingly, there were now two distinct options: the government-sponsored Free File and the commercial free editions. For customers who managed to qualify, the new commercial options offered by these companies were similar to what they could get on the IRS' Free File website: The underlying software was the same, only the federal return was free, and the companies expected to make money on each customer through charging for a state tax return or other services. But for the companies, there was a clear benefit to winning customers directly, rather than through the IRS program. The companies had complete control over how they handled customers from start to finish. Intuit poured ad dollars into its Free Edition. Not only did the new product effectively meet TaxAct's challenge, it quickly became the major driver of TurboTax's customer growth. [See the Chart: How Intuit Stopped Free File From Spreading[18]] That growth posed a challenge: how to, as internal company documents put it, 'monetize free.' Over successive tax seasons, Intuit unleashed teams of designers, engineers, marketers and data scientists on that problem, working at its headquarters in Mountain View and TurboTax's main offices in San Diego. Part of the solution was to pitch users side products like loans or 'Audit Defense.' But it also meant misleading customers. Frequently 'free' didn't mean free at all. Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file. The company came to a key insight: Americans' anxiety around tax filing is so powerful that it usually trumps any frustration with the TurboTax product, according to three former Intuit staffers. So even if customers click on 'free' and are ultimately asked to pay, they will usually do it rather than start the entire process anew. Intuit capitalized on this tendency by making sure the paywall popped up only when the taxpayer was deep into the filing process. 'There's a lot of desperation \u2014 people will agree, will click, will do anything to file,' said a former longtime software developer. Every fall before tax season, the company puts every aspect of the TurboTax homepage and filing process through rigorous user testing. Design decisions down to color, word choice and other features are picked to maximize how many customers pay, regardless if they are eligible for the free product. 'Dark patterns are something that are spoken of with pride and encouraged in design all hands' meetings, said one former designer. In the design world, 'dark patterns[19]' are tactics to get users to do something they don't necessarily mean to do. (ProPublica previously documented[20] dark patterns encountered by people trying to file their taxes for free.) On TurboTax's homepage, for example, the company carefully chooses how it describes the different editions. Prominently featured next to Deluxe Edition, which costs around $100, is the phrase 'maximize your deductions.' If users initially click on the Deluxe software, they are never offered the choice to go to the Free Edition even if the no-cost option would produce the same return. 'Maximize your deductions' was legendary at Intuit for its effectiveness in steering customers eligible for free filing to buy the paid product, according to a former marketing staffer. [See the Chart: Intuit's Share Price Has Shot Up in Recent Years[21]] Another celebrated feature, former staffers said, were the animations that appear as TurboTax users prepare their returns. One shows icons representing different tax deductions scrolling by, while another, at the end of the process, shows paper tax forms being scanned line-by-line and the phrase 'Let's comb through your returns.' What users are not told is that these cartoons reflect no actual processing or calculations; rather, Intuit's designers deliberately added these delays to both reinforce and ease users' 'Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.' The animations emphasize that taxes are complicated but also reassure users that the technological wizardry of TurboTax will protect them from mistakes. In a statement[22], the Intuit spokesman said, 'The process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it. To offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elements \u2014 content, animation, movement, etc. \u2014 to ensure our customers' peace of mind.' The 2007 launch of Free Edition started a period of rapid growth for TurboTax. Within two years, use of its web products had almost doubled, and over the past decade, its website has grown each year by an average of 2 million more customers. The company reported this year that TurboTax online had handled 32 million returns. In a statement, it said around a third of that number used Free Edition. The government's Free File program, meanwhile, has mostly faded into the background, drowned out by Intuit's and other companies' 'free' offers. The IRS did try advertising campaigns, spending around $2 million some years to spread the word. But compared with the reach of Intuit, this was a pittance: The company reported this year that it spent $800 million on advertising. With its budget slashed[23] by Congress, the IRS has spent no money at all to advertise the program in recent years. Amid its success, Intuit has sometimes had to put down insurgents bent on reforming the tax filing system. In 2007, the same year Intuit launched its Free Edition, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, took aim at the tax prep industry. In a speech to an audience of tax wonks in Washington, he promised that the IRS would establish a simple return system. 'This means no more worry, no more waste of time, no more extra expense for a tax preparer,' he declared. But the Obama administration, as Bush's had before, found that it was no match for Intuit. Again, Bernie McKay, the lobbyist who had joined Intuit in the late 1990s and outlasted multiple CEOs, led the company's campaign. In response to the Obama threat, McKay and Intuit's small army of outside lobbyists turned to Congress, where lawmakers friendly to the company introduced a series of bills that would elevate Free File from a temporary deal with the IRS to the law of the land. Republicans have historically been the company's most reliable supporters, but some Democrats joined them. Rep. Zoe Lofgren[24], the California Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has introduced or co-sponsored five bills over the years that would codify the Free File program, with names like the Free File Permanence Act. Lofgren's spokesperson told ProPublica that the congresswoman believes the IRS, because of its role as tax collector, should not also be the tax preparer. Hedging its bets, the company also sought to make sure the IRS could not spend a single dollar creating a public filing system. One internal document says Intuit would 'advance legislative language in House Appropriations for 'No Funds' restriction on IRS spending' on such a system. It worked. Within a few years, Congress passed a 3,000-page appropriations bill that included a single sentence crucial to Intuit's financial future: 'No funds[25],' the law decreed, could be used to 'to provide to any person a proposed final return or statement.' Another important aspect of Intuit's influence strategy during the Obama years was covertly enlisting[26] minority and women's groups to press its case. The internal 2014-15 'encroachment strategy' document[27] discloses plans to 'leverage trade groups to support House/Senate Free File bills.' It goes on to list the groups Women Impacting Public Policy, The Latino Coalition and the National Black Chamber of Commerce. Intuit has given money to all of those groups over the years. All have signed letters urging Congress to make the Free File deal permanent. 'The Free File program has been a clear success,' said one letter[28] signed by The Latino Coalition and the Hispanic Leadership Fund. A spokesperson for Women Impacting Public Policy said it has received $70,000 from Intuit. The amounts given to the other groups are unknown, and they did not respond to requests for comment. Company documents also outline plans to 'mobilize' a 'coalition' that included think tanks and academics, who published op-eds. Will Marshall, president of the pro-business Progressive Policy Institute, opposed return-free filing in an op-ed[29] in The Hill because doing one's taxes is 'a teachable moment [that] prompts us to review our financial circumstances.' Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, the most consistent champion of Intuit's policy positions, warned[30] that 'big spenders in Washington, D.C. want to socialize all tax preparation in America.' It is unclear whether they were paid by Intuit or the Free File Alliance. Norquist didn't respond to a request for comment, and a Progressive Policy Institute spokesman declined to say whether Intuit gave the group money. Whatever external challenges to the status quo Intuit has faced, the company has been able to rely on the IRS' continuing enthusiastic support of the Free File program. Every few years, the IRS and the industry got together to renew the deal. In part, that was due to the relationships Intuit had developed with high-ranking IRS officials. One, Dave Williams, served as the agency's top negotiator on the Free File program for several years and 'was very commercially sensitive,' said Mark Ernst, the CEO of H...lock until 2007. Ernst, who later held a senior role at the IRS, told ProPublica that Williams 'didn't want to offend the industry,' noting that 'he was particularly open to having sidebar conversations with key people where he could imagine himself landing some day.' Today, Williams works at Intuit, where he's held the title of chief tax officer since 2013. He is one of several former IRS employees who have gone on to work there. In a statement, Williams told ProPublica he did not have discussions about future employment with Intuit or other companies until after he left the IRS. He added that his career in government was focused on 'what is best for the taxpayer' and that he 'joined Intuit for the same reason: to help the American taxpayer.' Despite Free File's declining use, the IRS often claimed that the program was nevertheless meeting one of its original goals: driving more people to file electronically instead of on paper. Ernst, who served as a senior official at the IRS from 2009 to 2010, didn't believe that a program used by so few people was having any such effect. 'It was a talking point that got trotted out all the time to justify the Free File Alliance,' he said. Internally, IRS managers have also argued that the program is, in a way, a success, because it created 'a free marketplace,' as one internal management report in 2017 put it. Apparently, customers weren't the only ones taken in by the word 'free.' In 2018, Intuit faced rare scrutiny from inside the IRS. The agency asked its Advisory Council, a group of outside experts, to take stock of Free File. To the company's alarm, it soon became apparent that the council's report might be sharply critical. That July, council chair and University of California, Davis, law professor Dennis Ventry wrote two pieces criticizing an Intuit-backed bill in Congress that would make the program permanent. His op-ed[31] in The Hill was called, 'Free File providers scam taxpayers; Congress shouldn't be fooled.' In response, the IRS again rose to Intuit's aid. It rushed to assure the company that Ventry's power to affect the program was limited, according to emails[32] to the Free File Alliance obtained through a public records request. 'The Commissioner has met directly with Mr. Ventry,' IRS official Ken Corbin wrote to Steve Ryan, a lobbyist for Intuit who also represented the alliance. 'Mr. Ventry will recuse himself from participating or contributing to the topic of Free File.' Corbin heads the IRS division that processes most Americans' tax returns and negotiates the Free File deal with Intuit and the industry. A few days later, Ryan arrived at the IRS' Constitution Avenue headquarters in Washington to mount a defense of the program. A former Democratic Senate aide turned lawyer-lobbyist, Ryan is known on Capitol Hill for taking on politically fraught clients, including Trump attorney Michael Cohen and the government of Qatar. He helped create Free File in the early 2000s, and it was now his job to secure its future. Ryan's PowerPoint[33] presentation at the IRS rehashed arguments that the company had been making for the past 15 years. It also highlighted a 2013 study by Brown University professor John Friedman[34], a former Obama National Economic Council official, to make the point that the program had been successful in generating 'Free Tax Returns Outside of Free File.' The presentation did not mention that Friedman's study was paid for by the Free File companies and was not published in an academic journal. Friedman declined to say what he was paid but told ProPublica he 'wrote the piece based on my analysis of the issues, which I stand by.' Ventry, who attended the meeting, got a call the next day alerting him that a California public records request had been filed for his emails \u2014 they were subject to such a request because he's an employee of a state university. It came from the Free File Alliance, as The New York Times later reported[35]. The request, Ventry believes, was designed to 'freak me out.' In early October, the council sent a version of its final report, which included a harsh appraisal of the Free File program, to the IRS to seek responses before releasing it publicly the following month. But in mid-October, just weeks before the report saw the light of day, the Free File industry group fired off an 'urgent[36]' request to meet with IRS officials. The goal was to re-sign and 'improve' the memorandum of understanding that governed the Free File program, according to the emails. The current agreement wasn't expiring for another two years, but Ryan cited the 'time urgency to make changes that will benefit taxpayers' in the coming tax season, adding, 'I have not darkened your door in 2018 and need your attention to this opportunity.' The IRS' Corbin signed the new deal on Oct. 31. Two weeks later, the Advisory Council report was released, with a damning indictment of the program: 'The IRS's deficient oversight[37] and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk,' the report found. The expert body recommended that the IRS negotiate a series of new provisions designed to increase the use and oversight of the program, including mandating advertising by the companies. But it was too late. A new deal had already been signed with modest changes. As it had in the past, Intuit and the alliance had effectively insulated the program from reform. Members of the council, Ventry said, were 'pissed off.' A spokesman for the Free File Alliance said the group had pushed to renegotiate the deal in 2018 because of the looming 2020 presidential campaign. 'The reason for the timing of the extension of the agreement was the political season,' he said. The group had not seen the report before its release, he added. (In August, ProPublica sued the IRS to get more correspondence between the agency and Intuit's lobbyists. In response to our Freedom of Information Act requests, the agency has withheld over 100 pages. The case is ongoing.) The new deal included rules that barred Free File companies from offering extra products to the relatively small number of users who access the program. This makes it much more difficult to convert those users into paying customers. At around the same time, the industry took steps to make the program more difficult to find. Both Intuit and H...lock added code to their Free File websites that shielded them from search engines such as Google. The Intuit spokesman said the company increased paid search advertising for Free File 'by nearly 80 percent' over the last year and has data showing more people found the program through online search this year than last year, but he declined to provide specific figures. What is clear is that Intuit's business relies on keeping the use of Free File low. The company has repeatedly declined to say how many of its paying customers are eligible for the program, which is currently open to anyone who makes under $66,000. But based on publicly available data and statements by Intuit executives, ProPublica estimates that roughly 15 million paying TurboTax customers could have filed for free if they found Free File. That represents more than $1.5 billion in estimated revenue, or more than half the total that TurboTax generates. Those affected[38] include retirees, students, people on disability and minimum-wage workers. Customers, meanwhile, remain confused by Intuit's myriad uses of 'free,' and internal documents show the company knows it. Over just a two-week period this past filing season, Intuit received nearly 7,000 TurboTax customer calls in which the phrase 'supposed to be free' was uttered, according to a company analysis. One customer complained that Intuit charged him even though 'it says 'free free free' on the commercial.' The TurboTax representative responded: 'That ad has been the bane of my existence.' Even as TurboTax's business thrived, 2019 has been a rocky year for Intuit's long-running war against government encroachment. In April, the company was close to finally succeeding in its long-held goal to make Free File permanent. A bill called the Taxpayer First Act was sailing toward almost unanimous approval in Congress. But after ProPublica published a series[39] of stories about the program, including a story showing that military families[40] and students[41] were particularly affected by Intuit's business tactics, the bill stalled. Congress ultimately removed[42] the provision that would have enshrined Free File in law. After having enabled Intuit for so long, the IRS finally responded to the pressure. It hired a contractor to review the Free File program. But the contractor had previously argued[43] against the IRS offering its own tax prep option, and the review did not recommend major changes. The agency has not yet announced its plans for the future of the program. The agency's inspector general also launched an audit, which is ongoing. Other investigations and litigation followed, ranging from class-action complaints, alleging that consumers had been deceived by Intuit's tactics, to investigations and lawsuits by regulators and prosecutors in New York and California. Intuit has denied wrongdoing, saying it 'has at all times been clear and fair with its customers.' Despite the scrutiny, Wall Street has continued to embrace the company's business model. The company recently announced it made $1.5 billion in profits for its fiscal year. It expects its TurboTax unit to grow by 10% next year. Last year the CEO was paid $20 million. The share price hit an all-time record. The company has returned to its old strategy: stay the course and take its case directly to the IRS and Congress. Its allies in the Senate have again advanced an appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from developing its own tax filing system. In the spring, Sasan Goodarzi, a former head of the TurboTax unit who took over as CEO of the entire company in January, sought to reassure employees. 'Our view is this will be in the press until there is a resolution with the IRS,' he said, according to the video obtained ProPublica. 'And we're working with them and we feel very good about where this will end.'  Doris Burke contributed research to this story. Do you have information about Intuit, the IRS or tax prep?

But what they upload is \"electronic disappointment\", says David Butcher of Communications and Content.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once upon a time, we weren't all drowning in content. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the boom years before the financial crisis, investment businesses saw little need to publish their own material.</p><p>Take Schroders - a large and successful firm then, as it is now. Its website in, say, 2005, didn't offer much: company results plus a few articles on the introduction of international financial reporting standards and other technical subjects.</p><p>If you wanted to find out what your fund manager thought about a given topic, you would call or email\u00a0and\u00a0ask\u00a0for it.</p><p>Fast-forward 15 years and, thanks to digital technology and smartphones, every business is now a publisher. But in a world where it's easy to find someone's thoughts, there's a paradox.</p><p>And the paradox is this: why do fund managers, bright people solving interesting problems, create material that's so hard to read?</p><p>In other words, how does such intellectual and emotional gold dust get turned into so much electronic disappointment?</p><p>There's a prize for those who can overcome this paradox - because investment content that can inform, educate and entertain has a very good chance of boosting client engagement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reading ages</emphasis><br/>We know investment content is hard to read and understand - or to use linguistic jargon, has poor readability - because empirical evidence says so.</p><p>A Communications and Content report ('The Great Investment Content Paradox', published October 2019) shows that the average readability score of content published by a sample of award-winning UK investment businesses is 18.3.</p><p>This score is based on reading age - a common measure of literacy. </p><p>Material at this level of readability is comparable to exam questions or textbooks from the last year of secondary education or the first year of university. Complex stuff - especially if you haven't been studying this subject for most of your life. </p><p>In financial services, a good example is central bank speeches. When Bank of England governor Mark Carney or his team talk about the countercyclical capital buffer or foreign exchange market fragmentation, you need a reading age of 18.2 to understand it. </p><p>This is the mean average level investment content is also hitting.</p><p>The investment content score is also perilously close to academic papers published by EDHEC Business School. These documents are for academic peer review and contain all of the long sentences, jargon and complex algebra you would expect.</p><p>They have a reading age of 20.7 years. </p><p>Material published by investment businesses should aim at 14.8 years. </p><p>This is the level required for the best parts of the financial media - the\u00a0Financial Times, The Economist and\u00a0leading trade magazines, such as Funds Europe - all of which have the remit of informing, educating and, at times, entertaining.<br/>Investment content is overshooting its target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The most complex content</emphasis><br/>What makes this overshoot interesting is the lack of correlation between readability - again, how easy a piece of material is to read and understand - and the labels attached to that material.</p><p>And this is a second aspect of the paradox: investment content is not only too complex as a whole - it's almost always too complex for the specific audience it's aimed at.</p><p>We know this because there's no pattern between the labels attached to investment content (such as \"professional investors only\" or \"suitable for individual investors\") and the readability of that content.</p><p>For example, our analysis included 13 items of content with an 'institutional\" label. Six of them achieved an academic-type score, which is probably about right, but the rest hit reading age levels right across the board - from 22 down to 12, which is well below the financial media level. </p><p>But what's really noteworthy is that, if you're a private or individual investor, perhaps with an investment content reading age of 14.8, you're more likely to get more complex material. The average reading age for content aimed at this audience is a very high 19.4! </p><p>This is university-level material for entry-level people.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where you stand</emphasis><br/>These are early days. Investment businesses have only been publishing their own material for a dozen years or so. Some are only just starting.</p><p>So there is ample opportunity to test, learn and tweak readability.</p><p>There are five typical steps to using readability to boost client engagement. </p><p>The first is to audit content. A business might have a clear brand proposition, but if they communicate with multiple voices, without understanding the variance in complexity between those voices, then good brand work can be undermined. Audits tell you where you stand - and how much work you need to do.</p><p>Then look at audience capabilities. Our analysis says the reading age of investment content audiences is 14.8 years. But that's for the UK market as a whole. Better knowledge of your readership gives you more opportunity to engage them with targeted material.</p><p>Third is to construct (or reconstruct) clear and simple messaging.

The ubiquitous messaging service was finally entering the financial services arena with a payment service in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, after years of questions over how Facebook would make money from it.   The June launch, years in the planning, was meant to be the pilot for a potential global rollout - but eight days after going live, the central bank pulled the plug on it.   The shock decision underscores the challenge for Facebook in trying to win over financial regulators and the complexities facing watchdogs in assessing the risks of letting tech giants, with their vast network of users, loose in their world.   In Brazil, it also raises questions about the communications around the launch. WhatsApp executives and central bank officials had held at least three meetings in the previous 21 months, including two in the week running up to the launch.   In the first time he has spoken in detail about the decision, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto told Reuters the regulator had not determined how to deal with the proposed payment model - a new phenomenon in Brazil, which has no card money transfer service operated via an app.   \u201cPrior to the launch, there was a meeting in which WhatsApp kind of explained its plan, but the central bank was taken by surprise with the launch on June 15,\u201d he said in an interview.   The regulator - which said it never received a formal launch request - suspended the service, Facebook Pay, on June 23.   Campos Neto and other officials said concerns centered on competition, data privacy - they have not provided details - and ongoing deliberations over whether WhatsApp required a license as a company offering or arranging payment services.   WhatsApp told Reuters it had answered central bank questions and provided the launch schedule during the final meetings.   \u201cWe spoke openly about our plans to bring WhatsApp payments to Brazil,\u201d it said. The company added it was deeply concerned about users\u2019 privacy, financial details were stored on a secured network and it had data security contracts with all partners.   WhatsApp said it did not want to become a financial services company. Financial institutions in Brazil are subject to capital reserve requirements and strict regulations.   As a way around this, and within existing rules, WhatsApp sought to use Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc, which already had central bank licenses, to carry out the money transfers.   \u201cWhatsApp contacted us roughly two years ago to build a payments solution to bring convenience for their users and also because it did not want to become a financial institution,\u201d Visa\u2019s Brazil chief Fernando Teles said.  \u2018IN A PHASE OF ADJUSTING\u2019  WhatsApp said the service used payments networks from Visa and Mastercard, which are regulated companies in Brazil.   However Campos Neto said a money-transfer service provided by a tech platform had never existed in Brazil, the central bank had not yet decided whether WhatsApp itself needed a license.   \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that big tech isn\u2019t in the payments space in a big part of the world,\u201d he told Reuters on July 8. \u201cSo we\u2019re still in a phase of adjusting our regulations.\u201d   It is not the first time Facebook appears to have misread the regulatory runes as it seeks to enter the data-rich world of finance. A year ago, it unveiled plans for the Libra cryptocurrency, only to be met with a backlash from central banks.   In Brazilian payments, the prize is large, with a burgeoning market that saw 1.8 trillion reais ($336.86 billion) in card transactions last year. See GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2NTMSvG    In the initial stages of its service, WhatsApp was also looking to make use of a provision in payments regulation allowing companies to start services without a license until they reached 500 million reais or 25 million transactions over a 12-month period, according to a source close to the company.   This, again, is within the rules. However the provision, Campos Neto said, was aimed at encouraging small businesses to enter the market as opposed to a big tech network like WhatsApp with 120 million Brazilian users.   \u201cWhatsApp tried to take advantage of this rule, saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to start with very low volumes because once we\u2019re in the system, it will be tough to take us out\u2019,\u201d he said, describing the company as using \u201cthis volume gimmick\u201d.   The central bank changed this provision on June 23 to allow it to suspend companies covered by it.   Three meetings were held between WhatsApp and the central bank about the payment service, according to public central bank records: in October 2018, plus this year on June 9 and 12 - with one of those final talks attended by Campos Neto and WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matthew Idema.   WhatsApp said it also presented the central bank with its partnership model in 2019, although Reuters could not independently verify that meeting and the central bank declined to comment on meetings or dates.   Visa and Mastercard told Reuters they did not notify the central bank they planned to perform transfers for WhatsApp because they thought they already had the required licenses.   \u201cThere was no specific rule about messaging services in payments in Brazil, so we did it (the partnership) complying with existing rules,\u201d said Joao Pedro Paro, president of Mastercard for Latin America Southern Cone.  FACEBOOK\u2019S GLOBAL AMBITIONS  The setback is the latest blow to Facebook\u2019s global payments ambitions, key to boosting revenue in the developing markets that account for most of its user growth and realizing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision to stitch together the infrastructure underlying Facebook\u2019s apps, which also include Instagram.   WhatsApp has been trying to launch payments since 2018 in India, its biggest market, but remains stuck in beta testing.   The Brazilian service would not charge individual users, but merchants would pay a fee per transaction.   One competition concern, according to a source close to the central bank, centers on WhatsApp\u2019s planned use of Cielo SA as its payments processor - or acquirer - for cards like Visa and Mastercard. Cielo already has a dominant market share of 40% in Brazil.   \u201cI also must see the platform is open, which means that if more acquirers want to be in the platform, they are free to participate,\u201d said Campos Neto, though he did not mention Cielo.   WhatsApp, which has signed a deal with Cielo, said it did not have an exclusivity arrangement. Cielo declined to comment, but earlier told an antitrust watchdog there was no exclusivity.   In a further twist, the central bank is itself planning to roll out a fast-payment system in November, Pix, which uses consumers\u2019 checking accounts, a different terrain from Facebook Pay. WhatsApp has said it is open to integrating its service with Pix, which could offer one way to help break the deadlock.   The future remains uncertain, however.   Since Facebook Pay was suspended, central bank officials have met executives from WhatsApp, Mastercard and Visa in an attempt to find a way through.   Visa and Mastercard both delivered new business plans to the regulator last week in which WhatsApp formally appears as the originator of payments to be processed by the two other firms.   \u201cWhatsApp did not, and still does not, need to request a license to work with our partners,\u201d WhatsApp said. \u201cIf a change were to require WhatsApp to obtain a license, we would do so.\u201d   ($1 = 5.3435 reais)   Reporting by Carolina Mandl in Sao Paulo and Marcela Ayres in Brasilia; Additional reporting by Isabel Versiani in Brasilia and Katie Paul in San Francisco; Editing by Christian Plumb and Pravin Char</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNES-42610977012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-5411-JCSC-J3JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1409\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters Am\u00e9rica Latina</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Spanish</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>16 Julio 2020 Jueves</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Brazil</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Electronic Contracts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTkzQzdCODc0OERFNDNBQUJGMTMxQjg4RDExN0JDQUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I0MTBFMUE5MkM5NDM5REI2QTlEMDZCQ0MwQUVGNjc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Artists, Athletes &amp; Performers (O &amp; P Visas)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODZCRjQ3QUJFQTY2NEE5MEE1MURDREYzOUQzMDcxMzc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUM5REQzQTlCRjlDNDkwOEFEQTFDQURFOEI3OUJCNzY</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>Artists + Performers</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000444</classCode><className>Data Mining</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002014</classCode><className>Manufacturing</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

WhatsApp told Reuters it had answered central bank questions and provided the launch schedule during the final meetings.   \u201cWe spoke openly about our plans to bring WhatsApp payments to Brazil,\u201d it said. The company added it was deeply concerned about users\u2019 privacy, financial details were stored on a secured network and it had data security contracts with all partners.   WhatsApp said it did not want to become a financial services company. Financial institutions in Brazil are subject to capital reserve requirements and strict regulations.   As a way around this, and within existing rules, WhatsApp sought to use Visa Inc ( V.N ) and Mastercard Inc ( MA.N ), which already had central bank licenses, to carry out the money transfers.   \u201cWhatsApp contacted us roughly two years ago to build a payments solution to bring convenience for their users and also because it did not want to become a financial institution,\u201d Visa\u2019s Brazil chief Fernando Teles said.  \u2018IN A PHASE OF ADJUSTING\u2019  WhatsApp said the service used payments networks from Visa and Mastercard, which are regulated companies in Brazil.   However Campos Neto said a money-transfer service provided by a tech platform had never existed in Brazil, the central bank had not yet decided whether WhatsApp itself needed a license.   \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that big tech isn\u2019t in the payments space in a big part of the world,\u201d he told Reuters on July 8. \u201cSo we\u2019re still in a phase of adjusting our regulations.\u201d   It is not the first time Facebook appears to have misread the regulatory runes as it seeks to enter the data-rich world of finance. A year ago, it unveiled plans for the Libra cryptocurrency, only to be met with a backlash from central banks.   In Brazilian payments, the prize is large, with a burgeoning market that saw 1.8 trillion reais ($336.86 billion) in card transactions last year. See GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2NTMSvG    In the initial stages of its service, WhatsApp was also looking to make use of a provision in payments regulation allowing companies to start services without a license until they reached 500 million reais or 25 million transactions over a 12-month period, according to a source close to the company.   This, again, is within the rules. However the provision, Campos Neto said, was aimed at encouraging small businesses to enter the market as opposed to a big tech network like WhatsApp with 120 million Brazilian users.   \u201cWhatsApp tried to take advantage of this rule, saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to start with very low volumes because once we\u2019re in the system, it will be tough to take us out\u2019,\u201d he said, describing the company as using \u201cthis volume gimmick\u201d.   The central bank changed this provision on June 23 to allow it to suspend companies covered by it.   Three meetings were held between WhatsApp and the central bank about the payment service, according to public central bank records: in October 2018, plus this year on June 9 and 12 - with one of those final talks attended by Campos Neto and WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matthew Idema.   WhatsApp said it also presented the central bank with its partnership model in 2019, although Reuters could not independently verify that meeting and the central bank declined to comment on meetings or dates.   Visa and Mastercard told Reuters they did not notify the central bank they planned to perform transfers for WhatsApp  because they thought they already had the required licenses.   \u201cThere was no specific rule about messaging services in payments in Brazil, so we did it (the partnership) complying with existing rules,\u201d said Joao Pedro Paro, president of Mastercard for Latin America Southern Cone.  FACEBOOK\u2019S GLOBAL AMBITIONS  The setback is the latest blow to Facebook\u2019s global payments ambitions, key to boosting revenue in the developing markets that account for most of its user growth and realizing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision to stitch together the infrastructure underlying Facebook\u2019s apps, which also include Instagram.   WhatsApp has been trying to launch payments since 2018 in India, its biggest market, but remains stuck in beta testing.   The Brazilian service would not charge individual users, but merchants would pay a fee per transaction.   One competition concern, according to a source close to the central bank, centers on WhatsApp\u2019s planned use of Cielo SA ( CIEL3.SA ) as its payments processor - or acquirer - for cards like Visa and Mastercard. Cielo already has a dominant market share of 40% in Brazil.   \u201cI also must see the platform is open, which means that if more acquirers want to be in the platform, they are free to participate,\u201d said Campos Neto, though he did not mention Cielo.   WhatsApp, which has signed a deal with Cielo, said it did not have an exclusivity arrangement. Cielo declined to comment, but earlier told an antitrust watchdog there was no exclusivity.   In a further twist, the central bank is itself planning to roll out a fast-payment system in November, Pix, which uses consumers\u2019 checking accounts, a different terrain from Facebook Pay. WhatsApp has said it is open to integrating its service with Pix, which could offer one way to help break the deadlock.   The future remains uncertain, however.

The ubiquitous messaging service was finally entering the financial services arena with a payment service in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, after years of questions over how Facebook would make money from it.   The June launch, years in the planning, was meant to be the pilot for a potential global rollout - but eight days after going live, the central bank pulled the plug on it.   The shock decision underscores the challenge for Facebook in  trying to win over financial regulators and the complexities facing watchdogs in assessing the risks of letting tech giants, with their vast network of users, loose in their world.   In Brazil, it also raises questions about the communications around the launch. WhatsApp executives and central bank officials had held at least three meetings in the previous 21 months, including two in the week running up to the launch.   In the first time he has spoken in detail about the decision, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto told Reuters the regulator had not determined how to deal with the proposed payment model - a new phenomenon in Brazil, which has no card money transfer service operated via an app.   \u201cPrior to the launch, there was a meeting in which WhatsApp kind of explained its plan, but the central bank was taken by surprise with the launch on June 15,\u201d he said in an interview.   The regulator - which said it never received a formal launch request - suspended the service, Facebook Pay, on June 23.   Campos Neto and other officials said concerns centered on competition, data privacy - they have not provided details - and ongoing deliberations over whether WhatsApp required a license as a company offering or arranging payment services.

Those critics may be right. Just since the election, we've had swirling controversies over the impact of fake news - fueled by Facebookand Google's blackbox algorithms and ad revenues[3] - that may have shifted the election results a few crucial points. The Trump Administration's demonstrated tenuous relationship to actual facts[4] since then has only intensified concerns.  Separate from all that, advertisers have been boycotting Google[5], and to a lesser extent Facebook. They're unhappy that their brands keep ending up next to (and even paying for) extremists' videos, posts and other objectionable material.  The European Union is reviewing whether to punish Googlefor allegedly favoring its own services[6] in its search results, unfairly disadvantaging competitors. And European regulators, also exercised about social media as terrorism's training ground, are talking about changing 'safe harbor' provisions that shielded the big online services from legal consequences of the vile posts by their most horrible users.  All of these controversies pivot around a few issues: growing monopoly power by a handful of tech giants that dominate key sectors; the willingness to use that power against competitors, regulators and others in multiple additional sectors; and an outdated regulatory definition of the term 'monopoly' that hasn't kept pace with the digital era's unique conditions.  Now comes 'Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and AmazonCornered Culture and Undermined Democracy[7],' by Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of USC's Annenberg Innovation Lab.  I've known Taplin for two decades, back to his days founding and running an early digital disruptor, the video-on-demand service Intertainer[8]. He previously was an investment banker and also produced concerts for Bob Dylan and The Band, Martin Scorsese's first film Mean Streets[9], and prominent documentaries such as The Last Waltz\u00a0and Cadillac Desert. In short, he's been the Zelig[10] of media and technology the past few decades. And now he's deeply concerned about the monopolistic nature of those three big digital companies and what they're doing to publishers, musicians, filmmakers and other creators he's worked with for decades.  'I realized they were monopolies in the most classic sense,' Taplin said. 'In any other business, those companies were subject to antitrust regulation. But the Internet was set up to be free of any regulation whatsoever, even from taxation.' Indeed, in key sectors, the Big Three now enjoy overwhelming market advantages. Googledominates the search market[11], offering a variety of other services for free so it can gather vast amounts of information about its users to target ads more precisely and profitably. Facebookand its mobile subsidiaries (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram) collectively occupy a huge share of the Web's social media and messaging traffic. Again, that information allows Facebookto create highly targeted and profitable advertising while financing its forays into other areas. Amazon is somewhat different, using the deep data it collects to better target all the things it directly sells to its millions of users. And it, like Googleand Facebook, is aggressively moving into original content, competing directly with traditional Hollywood.  Compared to its digital cousins, Amazon has had, by far, the most success in original content, winning an Oscar and Golden Globes for its projects already[12]. This year, it is expected to spend at least $1 billion on programming[13] (Wall Street analysts suggest that number might be up to three times larger as Amazon expands into new international markets). But like the other two, Amazon depends on your data to drive its business.  'All they want is to get you in there so they can scrape your data and sell it back to advertising,' said Taplin. 'I had a realization that these companies have created a new kind of capitalism, surveillance capitalism.'  Taplin differentiates how the Big Three work from the operations of the world's most valuable company, Apple.  'Apple is in a very different business,' Taplin said. 'Apple is not in the advertising or search businesses, so they feel no need to retain all your data to target you and get you to buy stuff. These three, they're pushing it further into your home. What is the Amazon Echo (digital assistant)? It's a surveillance device. It's always on, listening.'  So what's to be done? Taplin has some ideas.  He suggests that regulators could take an approach similar to what happened with AT...n the 1950s, when it owned a monopoly on nearly all U.S. telephone service. It was regulated as a public utility and allowed to operate under the condition that all the patents out of its marvelously productive Bell Labs were to be licensed for free to any U.S. company.  That fueled an explosion of technology companies in sectors ranging from transistors to solar cells to satellites, and companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor, Motorola, Nokia and Comsat, Taplin said. Later of course, the government still embarked on a decades-long antitrust suit[14] that finally broke up AT...nto several (now partly recombined) units in the 1980s.  When a company's market domination reaches a certain scale, it's difficult for competitors to even emerge, Taplin pointed out. And if regulators won't move to contain companies from reaching or staying at that scale, bad things can happen to customers, or even to the country.  The European Union has long been much tougher at regulating American social-media and technology companies, in part because of endemic suspicions of American companies. They've also avoided 'regulatory capture,' the peopling of industry-connected executives in regulatory bodies such as the Office of Copyright, Federal Trade Commission and antitrust regulators in the Department of Justice. During the Obama Administration, top positions in all three agencies and elsewhere were filled by executives with Googleties.  'Europe is way ahead of the U.S. in antitrust regulation because of regulatory capture,' Taplin said. 'If you think about how Googleplayed the Obama Administration. (Google/Alphabet chairman Eric) Schmidt could have been Obama's chief of staff. It was a complete regulatory capture. Needless to say, the Europeans are not so susceptible to that.' Of course, the capturing continues. This week, Congress approved a measure allowing Internet service providers to resell users' web-browsing data[15] to marketers and others. Clearly, party affiliation hasn't been a defining issue in determining who will regulate the tech giants. And don't expect much to happen for now with additional regulation.  'As long as Peter Thiel (an early Facebookinvestor) is in White House, I can't imagine they'll do anything to hurt Facebook,' said Taplin. 'Once again, this is going to have to start in Europe.'  Taplin has a few prescriptions for curbing monopoly practices. While a GOP majority and the Trump Administration are almost certainly ill disposed to pursue antitrust measures against, well, just about anyone, some states' attorneys general have proven aggressive in attempting to protect privacy and other issues.  As well, Taplin suggests the companies should be barred from further acquisitions, to avoid some of the market abuses that already have resulted. Look at Facebook's multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of WhatsApp, Oculus, and Instagram. Each has benefitted from easy access to the social graph of Facebook's 1.7 billion users. Meanwhile, it's hard to ignore that Facebookis using its market power to try to stifle the upstart Snapchat by baldly copying many features into its messaging and social-media apps[16].  It's hard to see that behavior as good for consumers, publishers or even advertisers in the long run (even if I did suggest in a recent column that there were unexpected benefits from all the copying[17]). Taplin has another suggestion for all you investors. Buy Apple. Despite its $700 billion valuation, Apple remains relatively cheap, with a price-earnings ratio of just over 17. Compare that to Netflix (a P/E of 344), Facebook(40), Google(28), or Amazon (178).  'And it pays a decent dividend, too,' he said.  It's time the rest of us realized some dividends from the market power we've bequeathed to the Big Three without nearly enough conversation about what we've given up. Perhaps if nothing else, all the recent controversies will begin that conversation in earnest.  Visit Tubefilter[18] for more great stories.

While Facebook is long overdue for an overhaul after years of missteps and bad behavior, this pivot probably isn't that. Zuckerberg isn't killing his business, just trying to make it look better amid mounting public and political pressure. But even as Zuckerberg plasters platitudes over some less-meaningful tweaks to his business, what we still quaintly call 'social media' has already been overhauling itself.The 'Pivot' To Privacy (As A Strategy For Tech Imperialists)Facebook's changes are just part of much bigger shifts that long term will move us from what we've known the past decade into a new era focused on messaging, e-commerce, and intimate, quickly dissipated, and constant connections with people we may already actually care about. </p><p>Even Zuckerberg acknowledges that, at least in this crucial paragraph: 'Today we already see that private messaging, ephemeral stories, and small groups are by far the fastest growing areas of online communication. There are a number of reasons for this. Many people prefer the intimacy of communicating one-on-one or with just a few friends. People are more cautious of having a permanent record of what they've shared. And we all expect to be able to do things like payments privately and securely.' That paragraph could describe WeChat, the messaging app that basically runs the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. It also might make you think of some Apple initiatives, and to a lesser extent, what Facebook's own WhatsApp makes possible. With WeChat, you can order a meal, arrange a car pickup, make a payment, buy tickets, and much else. Also, you can send a message. It's effectively a meta-operating system, sitting atop whatever cellphone and mobile operating system you're using (and in China, that phone might be from Apple or, more likely, any of dozens of challengers using forked versions of Android). WeChat enables most things that people in China want to do with cellphones, without depending on the phone's maker to do much more than stay out of the way. You can see why that mobile-first, software-central approach might appeal to a tech imperialist such as Zuckerberg, focused on world domination and already such a control freak that he is his company's chairman, CEO, and majority shareholder. So he's planning to merge the technical back-ends of Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatApp[2], so that users of each network can easily message people on the other platforms. And the conversations would be private, walled off with cryptography from even Facebook's ability to track what's being said, Zuckerberg promises. That's probably a big deal, but not as big a deal as Zuckerberg would pretend it is. He's just making it harder to break Facebook into its component parts, as critics want, while imposing privacy in areas that won't affect Facebook's bottom line. The move also helps absolve Facebook of some of the endless, brutal challenges of moderating the mounds of egregious material trafficked across its pipes. That said, the move alsoacknowledges how much public enthusiasm for Facebook has waned. Calls for more regulation and even breakup are coming from everywhere, led by notable critics such as ProfessorZeynep Tufecki,[3]former Zuckerberg mentor and investor Roger McNamee[4], andU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren[5]. Expect more of that. Meanwhile, millions of users have abandoned the platform, and tens of millions more are using it far less, even if they can't yet completely disconnect. Worse, teens think of Facebook as the digital-media equivalent of a 1973 Impala, driven slowly and boringly by their grandmother. They have little interest in hopping behindthatwheel and going for a spin. All this isn't to say that the business of social media is going away any time soon. One recent study estimated that 13 million social-media influencers generated $7 billion in revenues last year[6]. And Instagram remains red hot, seemingly avoiding much of the backlash battering its parent company.But what's happening at Facebook is part of larger shifts affecting the entire industry.Voice Over ClicksThe other half of the Duopoly, Google, has seen prices for its cost-per-click search ads drop for 14 straight quarters. They were down 28% in Q3 of 2018. And ads, particularly search ads, pay for pretty much all of Google's other operations, almost certainly including that little YouTube unit whose revenue sharing has been social media's financial bedrock the past decade. As with Facebook, Google is facing epochal shifts in consumer behavior, brand motivation, and technology. A recent Forrester Research study[7] snapshotted the transition in digital marketing, away from traditional search ads and toward voice and voice-activated queries on phones, TVs, smart speakers, and all kinds of other devices. Google has technology for this, but so too do Apple, Samsung, and, especially, Amazon. These voice-powered devices soon willbe everywhere, transforming the way we search for and advertise about things. Smart brands such asCapital One[8], Domino's[9], Humana[10], and L'Oral[11]are already incorporating voice search into their marketing. If that Siri- or Alexa-enabled search defaults to something other than Google, as it can, that's a loss. Forrester says people are using other tools, including voice skills (as in bits of programming that tell Alexas what to do in specific situations), SEO, branded content and content on shopping-friendly sites. Yes, Pinterest, preparing for a lucrative IPO, should be in a good place. But Amazon is in an even better position[12]. Not only does Amazon have Alexa - helping funnel users to its content, resources and peerless e-commerce platform - it has so much more. There's Twitch, with 3 million monthly live streamers and a very different way to connect with audiences and monetize their attention. There's the Amazon influencer marketing platform[13], which sets up custom affiliate-marketing storefronts for influencers. And there's Amazon's own advertising operation, which generated most of the $3.4 billion in 'Other' revenue that Amazon reported[14]. Amazon is now third in digital advertising behind Google and Facebook. And it's not just Amazon poised for the future. As soon as March 25, Apple is expected to debut new services, including making $1 billion worth of big-name TV shows available free to its hundreds of millions of users. Those shows are likely to be far more interesting than anything served up so far in Facebook Watch or IGTV.Facebook Won't Be Able To Take A Bytedance Out of AppleApple also is likely to roll out a news and magazine service that can provide a more legitimate alternative to Facebook's shoddy NewsFeed. It likely would include publications you've actually heard of, instead of a feed of dubious posts from Russian tricksters and other marginal mayhem makers, interspersed with the occasional baby picture. Tim Cook has been hugely critical of Facebook's data malpractice. If he really wants to kneecap Facebook, Apple will make its messaging app and other services available beyond Apple devices. Recent deals with Samsung and other TV makers to enable access to Apple content might have been a first step. TikTok, another Chinese company with hundreds of millions of users, has hit its own hockey-stick moment with teens and tweens. Given owner ByteDance's own corporate heft, Facebook won't be able buy TikTok, Zuckerberg's usual Strategy No. 1 with competitors[15]. And while Facebook can copy TikTok's functions (Zuck Anti-Competitive Strategy No. 2), young users still aren't going there. They may not even care if Instagram adds those karaoke functions. There are other players out there, especially overseas, and especially among messaging apps with all kinds of capabilities that mean mobile users don't need to spend much time with Facebook, Google, or Twitter. In the end, Zuckerberg's pivot to privacy might become notable merely for memorializing a moment when the big players noticed the industry they've built has begun transforming into something else. For that, I suppose, we can thank him. Visit Tubefilter[16] for more great stories.

Each led a team filled with talent that had reached the pinnacle of their business, though by very different approaches. And, as you may have noticed, the veteran coach spanked the newcomer's team in a not-very-thrilling contest. I'm not talking about that lamentable Super Bowl[1], where the winning quarterback was nearly a decade older than the losing team's head coach. </p><p>No, I'm talking about theotherbiggame, between Team Apple and Team Facebook, over a small area where they overlap. It's all part of the long-running contest over whether our private lives should be stripmined for profit but too little payback.Tim Cook Flexes on Mark ZuckerbergVery roughly speaking, you can think of CEO Tim Cook and Team Apple as something like the NFL's New England Patriots, an established winner on top so long that it seems ludicrous when they claim to be underdogs. Their reign may be coming to an end as time, mobile-phone consumption patterns and circumstances change, but it hasn't happened yet. And, though it pains me on several levels, think of CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Team Facebook as more like the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, a fast-rising upstart headed by a much younger leader who keeps finding ways to change the game, and to win. Except last week. The putative battle was yet another example of Facebook's sometimes inattentive, sometime indefensible approach to the game of making money from the lives and output of billions of users and content creators. Earlier this month, Facebook got thumped by Apple for yet another transgression in a seemingly endless procession of sucky Team Zuck decisions. I won't bore you with a game replay, but it involved a crummy little Facebook app that gathered still more data from teens and 20-somethings[2] that somehow hadn't already been extracted. Given that teens and 20-somethings are increasingly ignoring Facebook, perhaps it's no surprise the company began paying some of them $20 a month so it could snoop more thoroughly. But it looked bad. More importantly, the app skirted, and possibly stomped on, Apple policies regarding a class of supposed internal-use-only apps for enterprises. Blah, blah, blah. After Apple temporarily shut downallof Facebook's internal iOS apps, a point was made. Facebook zapped the offending program and the spigot for everything else was turned back on. The resulting schadenfreude over Apple's little gut punch was something to behold. Many observers just seemed delighted that somebody somewhere had meted out somekind of consequence to Facebook (Google was also briefly shut down for a similar app[3]) for at least one of its many recent misdeeds. It wasn't much of a smack though.As Apple Insider put it: 'Facebook and Google are too big to fail.It took almost no time for Apple to reinstate the enterprise certificates for both companies. Would that have happened \u2014 ever \u2014 for a smaller company?' It's worth noting that Facebook turned 15 days after the fight. Apple is almost 43, triple Facebook and about the same age as Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady.Wall Street: Profits &gt; PrivacyFor most of Facebook's existence, Apple has been an ascendant power fueled by humongous iPhone sales in the mobile boom. Facebook's growth has been fueled by a very different approach, one that distills data into dollars, abetted by acquisitions such as Instagram, What's App and Oculus Rift. So, the younger company finally had some minor consequence for one of its many bad decisions. People celebrated.And then Facebook reported its quarterly earnings, which included record profits[4]. Hmm, not much of an object lesson here for Zuck and Team. And that's exactly the problem, I'll just guess, for the Old Ball Coach Tim Cook. Facebook is screwing it up for everyone else, even the giants such as Apple that have spent yearsnotmaking money off people's data. For months now, Cook has publicly and repeatedly needled Zuckerberg and Facebook about privacy issues. Cook understands that Facebook's endless litany of shame is going to drive the United States, India and, especially, parts of the European Union to reframe antitrust, amp up privacy rules and otherwise rein in the techno-libertarian, anti-regulatory bent that undergirded the tech explosion of the past 20 years. Facebook, Google and others took advantage of that hands-off regulatory approach just a little too much and now people are getting a bit peeved. Even as Zuck's Schmucks keep feeding new foulups into the fires of public opinion, we're seeing growing distrust of the tech sector and increasing political pressure to pull back its power. There's a reason all the big tech companies have significantly increased their spending on Washington lobbying the last two years. They know they're going to need the help.Regulation is ComingIndeed, after the latest mess surfaced, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted[5],'We cannot trust Big Tech to keep children's best interests in mind.' That matters because Markey is also one of three senators whosent letters asking Facebook, Apple, and Google whether they would support updated federal legislation protecting the privacy of teens and children. Expect more efforts like this over the next couple of years. By the way, last week also saw another big anniversary in tech history. During the Super Bowl broadcast 35 years ago, Apple ran its iconic '1984' ad[6], which took on the Duopoly of that day, Microsoft and IBM, in announcing the launch of the Macintosh computer. Last week, Apple threw a different hammer at a different duopoly, and it wasn't anywhere near so heavy. But Cook knows that a much bigger hammer may be coming down soon, if Zuckerberg doesn't finally get his act together. Play Video[7]Visit Tubefilter[8] for more great stories.

This is not a paid post, and I do not receive any compensation from him. Rather, I have interacted\u00a0with Joe off and on over the past decade. He is one of those readers who have stuck around for a while, who I regularly discuss dividend investing with. Writing about investing can be a lonely pursuit, so it is definitely helpful to have someone and bounce off ideas. SCHLOSS I am sharing this market commentary, which he shared privately with his clients, because a lot of his points resonate very well with me. </p><p>While no two investors are alike, his strategy of finding quality dividend payers for the long term really hits home for me. The letter captures current market sentiment, investing strategy, lessons learned and general commentary. If I ever leave blogging to manage money full time, this is the type of letter I would be sharing with clients. Without further delay, this is the comment letter from Joe Ferris at : Dear Friends, 2017 was a remarkable year in the equity markets. The broader US stock market did\u00a0not have any negative months in the year,\u00a0giving it the distinction of being the strongest market, per that metric,\u00a0in 90 years 1. Furthermore, there was no correction greater than 3% in the year, which is unusual for equities.\u00a0The graphic that I included over\u00a06 months ago has proved to be correct, for now, as we have broken out, to the upside, of a long trading channel in the S P. There are a number of reasons for this. Before the presidential election in November 2016, I thought that the Blue Team would win, and that minimum wage would be gradually raised, inflation would creep up, and goods and services would earn more revenues. This would put a higher floor in our companies' earnings, spurring the market to pay a higher multiple for our companies' earnings. Well, as we all know, the Red Team won, and now, minimum wage is being gradually raised 2, inflation is creeping up, and our company's goods and services are earning more revenues. It's funny how that happens. There is also the matter of the large corporate tax cut, which gives our companies more after-tax profits. The market has been excited by that. We have seen a number of US companies either attempt (in the case of Pfizer and Allergan) or execute (Medtronic, Johnson Controls, etc) foreign inversions in the past decade, so it makes sense to me that incentives should be provided for US companies to not pack up and run to lower tax regions. However, they should also have more regulations on tax avoidance, and that is indeed happening, with some companies getting rid of their tax shelters 3.<br/>In 2016, many Summer Fields Investments accounts beat the broader market due to us buying selected financials when they were depressed during the summer Brexit vote. 2017 presented a higher hurdle.<br/>The last time we bought Boeing was when they were under investigation by the SEC for accounting irregularities, in the first quarter of 2016, for approximately 114 per share. This presented an\u00a0opportunity that we always search for- a good company which is going through temporary drama that depressed share value. Since early 2016, Boeing share price has gone up to around 333, a 192% return in the past 2 years. Much of that rise happened since the election. In January 2017, it started at 157, where I thought it was already richly valued, and went up another $199 in 2017, a 126% return in 2017. Boeing is now very overvalued, in my opinion, trading well over historical market multiples. Being that the Dow Jones Index is only 30 companies, Boeing dragged the Dow up very high in 2017, to around 26%. The S P returned 19.4% for the year.This type of behavior is a characteristic of a more mature phase in the market cycle and in the bull market. There is a lot of global liquidity and people want to put their money to work as they see the market gaining over the past years. Excited investors pile into the winners, and those that already have appreciated a lot attract even more capital. We see this especially in the FAANG stocks- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. It has been tough to compete with that kind of excitement in 2017 on a total return basis. However, all of your accounts have done well in 2017, most comfortably in high double digit territory, and some of you exceeding 20% for the year. All of you, of course, have higher\u00a0current dividend yields than the richly valued S P, now yielding around 1.84%. The Dow also similarly yields around 1.99%, also fairly expensive. In January 2018, many of our companies have joined the market excitement. Abbvie, which many of us own, went up 15%, more than doubling in the past year (unjustifiably, in my\u00a0opinion- the\u00a0market is overexcited about short term catalysts in the stock, including Abbvie winning a lawsuit which extends patent\u00a0protection of Humira for a little longer than anticipated). Target Corp. went up almost 40% in the past few months, and 12% since the beginning of the year. Long term market returns can often be lumpy. Of course, leading into February, the market has been in correction mode. I will address my thoughts on the current state of the markets and my projections for the future later on in this update. I shared in the last Summer Fields Investments update how Cisco Systems behaved in the Tech Boom and Bust of the late 1990s and how we started buying when they were significantly cheaper,\u00a0after they initiated a dividend. We have done very well with those purchases, and the aggregate Cisco position in Summer Fields Investments is up over 35%, including dividends paid. I would like to now share my experience with FAANG, specifically with Apple Inc. I was familiar with the brand, having been an Apple user since the late 1990s.\u00a0There were execution fears and issues which the company navigated through in their early days after Steve Jobs returned to the company, and the successful launch of several iPhone cycles cemented their status as the tech darlings, and indeed, market darlings, of the time. In 2010 and 2011, an enormous amount of capital, from hedge funds, to growth investors, to general retail investors, piled into the name. Apple share price went up a lot in that period. As their product cycles matured, they decided to initiate a dividend in 2012. I took that as a sign that management was confident about their future prospects, and after much analysis, surveying, and testing, I initiated a small position shortly after the dividend initiation announcement. I thought it would be good to put a toe in the water and the valuation, although high, seemed somewhat reasonable for a richly valued growth stock.<br/>In the next year, the stock fell over 40% from the 2012 highs as hedge funds and growth investors fled the name. At that point, I bought with both hands. The stock has\u00a0since almost tripled, and the annual dividend has been raised by\u00a0approximately 10.6% per year since then. There are a lot of lessons\u00a0in this story. First off all, averaging into positions is always nice, because it is harder to predict what happens in the\u00a0shorter run. We do this by generally\u00a0averaging into the market via reinvesting dividends. I also encourage you to invest new cash regularly/monthly for this reason. Secondly, no publicly traded company is immune to gravity. All companies that I have studied\u00a0have periods of overvaluation, sometimes extremely so, and sometimes for extended periods - and all companies have periods of undervaluation. There is no company that always rises with no stop. Consolidation occurs, volatility occurs, change in perception occurs- and that is precisely how we capitalize on opportunities that arise. When the opportunity arises, of course, the question is, what does a person capitalize on. What do we decide to plant in our dividend fields? Let's talk a little bit about some of the hot names of the current market cycle. I've discussed some of these names in the past and it would be nice to revisit them. Big Tech had a great run in the past couple of years. Technology typically can always get ahead of itself because it is fertile ground for human imagination. We can't imagine what will happen in the future and sometimes, when excited, we humans can overpay for potential and possibility. We see this happening in many\u00a0different companies\u00a0currently. Typically, companies on the stock market trade for a multiple of their future earnings, and make various amounts of profit depending on their earnings growth, how good the year is, how much stock they bought back or issued, and so on and so forth.\u00a0Netflix is\u00a0hemorrhaging free cash flow, as you can see in the diagram above. They are taking on enormous amounts of debt in order to create new content and shows, and in order to advertise more.\u00a0Bullish investors in the stock hope that they will ultimately put together something \"sticky\" enough to retain viewers and make it so that people won't cancel the service. They\u00a0might also be able to raise prices higher in the future as they hope to achieve high market share and thus a degree of inelasticity. The market is\u00a0valuing the company very\u00a0highly now for a number of reasons. They have a good position in the market now. They have advanced technology that they have built out over the years. Also, the market currently like SaaS models (software as a service), because they are\u00a0predictable and an easy-to-value revenue stream, which can be leveraged especially in a low interest rate\u00a0environment. Netflix would be a perfect example of a company that hasn't made much in the way of profits, but has taken\u00a0advantage of this low rate and low regulatory tech environment to grow their revenues\u00a0tremendously. The market has rewarded them because their share price has grown too. However, they will have to pay the piper one day.\u00a0Disney is coming out with their own SaaS model. Disney has multiple revenue streams including ESPN,\u00a0theme parks, and\u00a0tentpole movies. There will be a time when the market will demand profits, and\u00a0possibly\u00a0sell stocks that have negative cash flows. I am\u00a0concerned that these types of high flying growth stocks will be\u00a0severely hit, much like our old buddy, Cisco, which fell about 90% from the highs in the 2000 Bust. Tesla is worth mentioning. I give Elon Musk a tremendous amount of credit for advancing alternative energy in the public\u00a0sphere,\u00a0and pushing other companies to be competitive in that regard. However, as it stands now, the company is a black hole of unprofitability, running on a lot of hype,\u00a0hope, and cash deposits for cars that may or may not\u00a0be ready far into the future. The market seems\u00a0excited that they\u00a0delivered approximately 103,000 vehicles in 2017. Ford produced 6.4 million cars in 2016. Ford is\u00a0worth 42 billion dollars, and Tesla is worth 58 billion.\u00a0Financial legend\u00a0Jim Chanos, the person who discovered accounting irregularities in Enron which ended up helping to bring the company down, is short Tesla stock, which means he is\u00a0betting that\u00a0the stock goes down. This is not a stock I would buy for a dividend growth investment. However, I would not short this company as they are on the forefront of innovation. It is just that the cash flow statements of the company do not inspire me to invest in this business, until I see more mature operations. Facebook is a similar tale with\u00a0different\u00a0details.\u00a0Big Technology\u00a0companies\u00a0were allowed to get away with a lot in the previous decade as the United States was very permissive in not demanding technology companies be liable for much at all, so that they could grow unencumbered. We are currently seeing more regulation enter the space,\u00a0as government entities push for more accountability\u00a0especially\u00a0around full\u00a0disclosure of campaign funding 4. When a\u00a0stock is rising and has momentum, it is a terribly exciting time. But there may come a time, especially in the age of trade\u00a0tariffs and reaction to globalization, when more limits are imposed on Big Tech than are currently priced into the markets 5. That time may come sooner than later 6. There also seems to be a bit of public backlash around social media, where thought leaders are questioning the utility of its addictive and potentially\u00a0vacuous nature. Furthermore, if these large companies such as\u00a0Facebook are indeed a platform, and not a\u00a0media company, as they have historically claimed, they\u00a0might then have to be classified and regulated as a\u00a0utility. Facebook is currently trying to serve many masters, and is struggling with its identity. It must be addictive to be able to\u00a0charge top dollar for advertising, but it must also be appealing enough for people to stay on it and feel good about it and themselves for the long run. There is also the issue of incentive, where Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, has 60% of the voting power. He may not feel the\u00a0need to pay himself dividends if he owns over $70 billion of equity in FB. There has also been drama in the past where he wanted to retain voting majority control of the company even if he sold more than a majority of his shares, and this was ultimately\u00a0vetoed after shareholder revolt. This does not reflect\u00a0well on current corporate culture. I could be wrong, and if Facebook decides to pay a dividend I will reconsider. Even then, I would wait for a track record, and a cheaper valuation before buying. I can write many more paragraphs in continued\u00a0analysis, but suffice it to say, I prefer investing in more mature companies that have a good track records, solid\u00a0fundamentals,\u00a0and recurring cash flows and a corporate culture that is favorable to shareholders. An investor must always be vigilant, but over the long term,\u00a0history has shown that the odds of success are better with companies that have the discipline and corporate culture of paying regular\u00a0dividends for an extended period of time 7. Before I close the book on FAANG in this email I should also\u00a0mention Amazon. Amazon is a remarkable business that has managed to stretch itself quite far into the\u00a0world and in commerce in general. US retail revenues\u00a0were around $5 trillion in 2017, and about 4% of that total was\u00a0transacted through Amazon in 2017, an\u00a0impressive number. They have a similar SaaS style valuation where Prime subscriptions are valued highly by the market, and they also indeed offer software as a service in their AWS (Amazon Web Services). They have also been effective at trying to circle many businesses' wagons in various ways. We see\u00a0them undertake many business initiatives, some of them great, and some of them silly. They are not afraid to\u00a0take risks. They are becoming a more and more impressive business as time goes on. Even more recently, it seems that they have beat\u00a0Apple to the punch when it comes to home-based speakers. While I thought that they failed at electronics because they did a terrible job at trying to get their Amazon phone to the public, they actually rallied their resources afterward to supply cheaply made\u00a0home speakers to the public. We will see how it plays out as the technology is still nascent. While we wait, I am\u00a0comforted that of the 5 trillion dollars of retail business revenues achieved in the US, approximately $4.8 trillion of it was not\u00a0transacted via Amazon. Somehow I think that diversified investors might be able to profit from even a small percentage\u00a0of that bounty. There is also a lesson of perception in there, because if an alien visited earth and read the news in the past year, he would\u00a0probably think 20%+ of retail revenues\u00a0were transacted through Amazon in 2017. But no, it was only 4%. In fact, many of your\u00a0portfolios took advantage of all of the fear and hype. The day that Amazon announced that they were purchasing Whole Foods, Target Corporation was sold down to $49 per share, and early that morning I was holding my nose, gritting my teeth, and\u00a0initiating and adding to positions with whomever had the liquidity at that particular\u00a0moment. Target makes between $3 - 5 billion in free cash flow per year and pays out $1.3 billion in dividends, using the rest for investing in the business and repurchasing shares. They own their own real estate, unlike Amazon which leases much of their\u00a0infrastructure. Even though the media was making it out to be\u00a0devastation and\u00a0catastrophe, I would buy a situation like that all day long, especially at 11 - 12 times earnings. Now,\u00a0Target has gone back up to almost 73\u00a0per share. That is a classic value investing move, and I am proud of how we handled that. With smaller companies struggling and\u00a0closing, and a good\u00a0emphasis on brands that their customers enjoy,\u00a0Target should get even more business, and I\u00a0hope they pay us\u00a0dividends for years to come. I'll end my FAANG tirade\u00a0with this. As we know, it is\u00a0all about incentives. I am not a hater, I am a value investor and fairly agnostic to value. If Jeff Bezos decides he doesn't want to sell a\u00a0billion dollars worth of his own stock annually any more to fund his rocket ship hobby 8 and initiates a dividend, and the stock gets cheap relative to earnings, I'll happily buy for all of you. As of now, it is only a\u00a0moonshot in the most liquid of Summer Fields Investments accounts, albeit an expensive company, led by a most remarkable business mind and quantitative finance\u00a0visionary. However, they have margins between \"slim\" and \"none\", heavily subsidized money-losing retail\u00a0operations, and NYU business professors yelling at them for antitrust violations and acting in bad faith 9. It will be fascinating to see how the US and EU ultimately decide to deal with Big Data and Big Tech. Ultimately, if data is the new oil, as many say, it might be regulated as such. If privacy is a competitive advantage, as some economists maintain, it might be\u00a0anticompetitive if only a few companies possess huge troves of data about\u00a0billions of people. They may have to democratize this data in the future, causing less profits to them, but spreading the competitive advantages out for the betterment of progress in our capitalist society. A few Summer Fields Investments related matters: 1)\u00a0As we\u00a0know, lower fees improve portfolio returns. I think that after I hit around $12 million in assets under management I'll bring down my annual fee even further. Although my fees are already attractive compared to other RIAs, I have been inspired by Vanguard Funds lowering their costs as their assets under management get larger. So, keep those referrals coming.\u00a0I want to be a\u00a0continuously more attractive place for you to invest and to keep investing into. Lower fees will keep things that way. 2) There is a good chance I will be moving somewhere outside of California when my wife\u00a0Lori finds a job. I already have clients in 4 states and\u00a0my location won't be a significant impact on my business. I'll come visit California from time to time\u00a0and we can communicate by FaceTime or Skype if we need to. 3) I am\u00a0interested in creating a non-profit business entity\u00a0in order to channel my passion for dividends into an organization that is purely charitable. No management fees, no fancy dancing. It would be a labor of love. It will probably be structured as a 501(C)3 (federally\u00a0tax\u00a0exempt non-profit organization) and the dividends will, by law, have to be distributed to 501(C)3 institutions like food banks and other causes. I plan on recruiting some of you to the board of Summer Fields Endowments and we can give a little charity, feed the hungry,\u00a0and help the world with dividends. You may\u00a0contribute for\u00a0charitable purposes and/or for the\u00a0tax write-off when it is established. I'll keep you posted. This has been a remarkable couple of years in the equity markets. I am very\u00a0pleased with how accounts are being built out over time. I am also proud of some of the decisions we made through the year, including investing into some technology\u00a0companies that have infrastructural advantages, and to harvest some of the outsized gains we saw for the benefit of those retiring sooner than later.<br/>In the frothiest markets\u00a0in\u00a0late 2017 and early 2018, I was taking\u00a0advantage of some the massive capital gains with\u00a0selected\u00a0retirement accounts, especially for those who are retiring soon or already retired. As\u00a0the market gave us these extreme gifts, it wasn't a stretch for me to decide to take\u00a0advantage of some of these gains and reinvest into more\u00a0yield-producing\u00a0stocks\u00a0for the benefit of portfolio income, especially for those retiring sooner. This is part of evolving with the needs, goals, and time frames of every client portfolio in its own way.We are now in a correction period. The market has accepted that the\u00a0easy money from Central Bank easing over the past years is coming to an end. It wasn't a surprise that on the first day of the new Fed\u00a0chair's job, the market took its most substantial tumble. The market is now finding its footing in a new regime where interest rates are slightly rising,\u00a0although they are still very low historically. I expect the\u00a0market to consolidate and digest some of the last year's gains here. We should see a little\u00a0more weakness, until all earnings come in for the\u00a0quarter\u00a0and get\u00a0analyzed by the market. The market needs proof that real earnings are rising, and I suspect the market will get its proof. Earnings are\u00a0indeed\u00a0being revised up. This should lead the next leg of the bull market up.The work now is to stay in the boat and let it rock about in the storms, while reinvesting dividends and investing new cash. After the storms\u00a0pass, the boat should take\u00a0us where we need to go. Our businesses are designed to give shareholders returns exceeding inflation, and good current income. This volatility is sector rotation, consolidation, profit taking, and noise. Further into the future, I have good news and I have slightly\u00a0disappointing\u00a0news. The good news is, Elliot Wave market analysis predicts higher highs in the future\u00a010. Jeff Saut from Raymond James\u00a0maintains that we are in a strong bull market with years ahead of it 11. Jeremy Grantham thinks there is a possibility of another 20-30% or more upside to the equity markets 12. The more\u00a0disappointing news is that the next powerful wave in the bull market cycle is probably the last one in the cycle, according to some Elliott Wave analysts. So we can expect higher highs than we have seen\u00a0before, possibly significant ones, before the next bear market. How long or how intense the ensuing bull wave, or\u00a0the\u00a0next bear market is, no one knows. I would like to think that due to the sharp bear markets we have had in 2000 and in 2008,\u00a0we are in for an easier\u00a0period in equities. This supposition can also be supported by the fact that almost 100 million\u00a0millennials are getting\u00a0married and starting their own\u00a0families, buying their own houses and SUVs,\u00a0increasing their consumption, and possibly\u00a0contributing to an economic boom much like the baby boomers did before them. Of course, the particulars will be different, but the theme\u00a0may be the same. There is also the issue of\u00a0underfunded pensions. Pensions may sell their bonds and invest more into equities in the coming years as inflation and pension liabilities grow. What I can tell you, though, is that bear markets usually last a significantly\u00a0shorter amount of time than bull markets. The average length of a bear market is 14 months, and the average length of a bull market is 48 months 13. Being that equities have outperformed most all other asset classes in the past 120+ years, I am very confident and happy to keep invested in them through many market cycles. In fact, it is my fervent wish to work with, and invest with you all through multiple market cycles, through the\u00a0ups\u00a0and the downs. I am\u00a0incentivized to grow your assets with you, and to make you want to be friends with me in decades to come, not just ride the current waves of hype in any particular sector or industry that is hot right now. To briefly address Bitcoin, everyone I admire in finance is\u00a0skeptical of its long term utility. Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Seth Klarman, Byron Wien, John Bogle (Vanguard founder) and more have all either expressed skepticism or outright suggested that people avoid it altogether.<br/>From a perspective of historical pragmatism, there have been many technology booms in the past that attracted an enormous amount of capital, which indeed helped to spur the technology to ultimate widespread adoption, but many of the original investments in the sector were unprofitable. This is to imply that the underlying technology of Bitcoin, the \"blockchain\" (which IBM currently has an excellent corporate position in 14) might be used ubiquitously in the future, but there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will be used along with it.<br/>Caveat Emptor; buyer beware. A large portion of outstanding\u00a0Bitcoins are controlled by a small group of people, and it is in their interest to hype it worldwide so that as many people as possible buy it, thereby inflating the value of their holdings. I have one more thing to comment on, and that is the S P index. We all know that indexing is very\u00a0popular nowadays. It is easy to be\u00a0happy with market indices when they are doing well. However, we should not forget about the \"lost decade\" of 2000-2010, when both the S P and the Dow returned approximately 1% per year in that time frame. But I have an even better one for you. 2017\u00a0has been a milestone for Japan. The\u00a0Japanese Nikkei\u00a0index has finally touched the high it\u00a0achieved THIRTY YEARS AGO. You read this correctly. The annualized rate of return of the Japanese Nikkei index has\u00a0averaged 1% per year since 1988 15. This is very\u00a0poor, indeed. Japan went into a\u00a0crazy bubble through the latter part of the 1980s, going up many tens of percent per year for nearly a half a decade. The Yen was strong, their businesses were strong, and there was a lot of hype around their equity markets. That highly extended\u00a0overvaluation proved to be a long term negative for a Japanese index investor who wanted to live on his funds by selling stock every year in hopes that his stock would appreciate. Now, there are clear difference between Japan and the USA. The US has a far broader and more diversified economy, and better demographics than Japan. But the idea stands. There is risk holding just a market\u00a0index. That is why it is important to buy attractively valued, dividend producing\u00a0stocks. It should protect portfolios from\u00a0sequence of returns dangers like that. Furthermore,\u00a0depending on the dividends and not capital appreciation to monetize the investments removes some of that\u00a0risk as well. Therefore, I am extremely passionate about my dividend growth stocks. As my\u00a0colleague Dividend Growth Investor who writes an eponymously named blog\u00a0recently put it, \"Should I invest in dividend stocks or in growth stocks? How about dividend growth stocks? You get the best of both worlds - growing dividend income and solid total returns\". I should also reiterate that I am a value agnostic, and in that spirit, I have recently been investing in international dividend paying equities\u00a0that have more attractive valuations relative to some US companies as well. We will buy high quality, dividend paying, attractively valued companies where we can get them. Thank you for the\u00a0privilege of allowing me to invest on your behalf, and to be of service in this important area. I am personally all in equities, having been invested in them successfully for 20 years. I expect the next 20, and the 20 after them, will also be quite successful, and certainly choppy and eventful, as is the\u00a0nature of equity investing. I have been through the Asian currency crisis in the 1990s, the tech bust early in the century, 2008 recession, Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown, earnings recession of 2015, energy and market dip in Q1 2016, and the current volatility. Volatility is part and parcel of equity investing. It is like the weather or a bad mood, we can't avoid those things, we can only get through them, or in the case of equities, attempt to actually take\u00a0advantage of the downturn to buy companies at cheap prices.\u00a0Volatility is inherently part of nature, and to try to suppress it for long periods of time can actually be dangerous and cause more trouble in the future. Consolidations and pullbacks are necessary to let off steam in the case of bubbles, and to form bases for further growth. While the market is currently scared of inflation, I am not. Our companies possess the pricing and earnings power to navigate through, and probably handily beat inflation over the longer term.<br/>I am excited about the investment opportunities that this year might continue to provide us. As Warren Buffett is fond of pointing out, America still has exceptionally fertile ground and rule of law that is conducive to\u00a0investment. By regularly investing into these volatile capital markets, we can take\u00a0advantage and\u00a0average into good dividend paying companies for the long run.Sincerely, Joe P.S. Some actionable things for you to do if you are motivated. 1) Vote for Qualcomm management via either your proxy mailers or through your email from interactive Brokers asking you to vote for Qualcomm. Broadcom is trying to acquire them. While you, the investors, win whatever ends up happening, I'd prefer Qualcomm remain a stand alone company. 2) Buy online when you can from Target.com. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Have a great weekend!<br/>MENAFN301802201800490000ID1096407529</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1096478484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RNW-3PK1-JCNX-33P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 17, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002EAL</classCode><className>ALLERGAN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001U7B</classCode><className>MEDTRONIC INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002OZ9</classCode><className>JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>PFZ (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>PFE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>TYC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000518</classCode><className>DIVIDENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

In this first big batch of deals in months, they all say something about the future of the still-transforming business of delivering entertainment, media and information to you and me. To start, there's that long-awaited re-merger between corporate siblings Viacom and CBS that will createViacomCBS. </p><p>They must have paid the naming consultantsa lot for that one. The deal culminates four years of boardroom and courtroom conflict for Shari Redstone's National Amusements, including the ugly ouster of negligent former Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, the fight to control elderly patriarch Sumner Redstone's vote, and CBS CEO Les Moonves' ballsy attempted palace coup and eventual #MeToo-fueled ouster. Then they needed another year to talk about the obvious next step. Now the talking is finally done. This deal happened because Shari Redstone wanted it (she controls 80% of both companies), and because the market demanded it.Bigger But Not BigSimply put, both companies are too small (a combined market capitalization of around $27 billion) to thrive separately in this Gigantist Era of entertainment and media. Even combined, ViacomCBS remains undersized compared to competitors such as Apple, Amazon, AT...Disney, Comcast, and Netflix that each have valuations anywhere from five and 34 times larger. But at least, as Bob Bakish, ViacomCBS' future president and CEO, put it, the company doesn't have'any big gaps per se.' Its assets include broadcaster CBS; premium cable service Showtime; basic cable stalwarts such as Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV; subscription VOD service CBS All Access; ad-supported VOD service Pluto.TV; movie studio Paramount; and publisher Simon ...huster, among numerous other holdings. But this deal also happened because Bakish made Viacom more than roadkill on the highway to the future. He focused on six core cable properties, and gave Paramount a useful focus and an empowered CEO in studio vet Jim Gianopulos. Before becoming CEO, Bakish fixed Viacom's international operations, which will be vital to long-term growth. And as CEO, he led it on a buying spree that made it relevant to people under 25, which it hadn't been for years. Bakish's Viacom bought VidCon[2] and influencer-marketing agency WHOSAY[3], and picked up teen-focused production company Awesomeness at a massive discount[4]. The $340 million Pluto.TV deal[5] will be really important, providing an ad-supported way to reach online audiences just as the fight for subscription dollars gets really ugly.Finally Worth Talking ToThat makeover also made Viacom worth talking to for CBS snobs who thought their company had better ways to spend its money than saving a weak sister. Now, Viacom is arguably better positioned than CBS. And finally closing the deal will unleash the combined company: 'One of the other things this deal does is take a big uncertainty off the company, which was an overhang \u2014 we will be very well positioned to exploit those opportunities,' Bakish said. The opportunities include what Bakish called 'low-hanging fruit,' like putting Paramount movies on Showtime, or CBS ad-supported channels on Pluto. But ViacomCBS' long-term involves either more acquisitions, being acquired, or both.I have to imagine Lionsgate, Discovery or MGM is next on the shopping list.The Great TumblWhich leads us to another, embarrassingly small deal: mobile giant Verizon ditched another component of its once ambitious media and entertainment empire, selling Tumblr for deci-pennies on the dollar. It's mildly stunning that Tumblr, bought by eventual Verizon unit Yahoo for more than $1 billion, would end up shipped off for $3 million to Automattic, makers of the WordPress publishing system I'm using to write this column. The sale price says a great deal about Verizon's laughably lame stewardship of Tumblr. For years, the site was a beloved platform for tens of millions of angsty outsiders of all sorts, who found anonymous comfort and an online home. To its dubious credit, Verizon was at least efficient in wiping out Tumblr's value, though in cleaning out (most of) the porn, it has zapped a distressing amount of non-porn content, especially from LGBTQ users. So boo on that, phone jerks. It's easy to blame Tumblr's fall on recent shifts in the social media industry that it helped pioneer. But given Verizon's sorry non-phone track record (Go90, anyone[6]? Or buying the bankrupt Vessel[7] to reboot Go90? Or buying AOL, Huffington Post, and Yahoo?), nah. The lesson here: big tech companies generally have learned how to do one thing pretty well. But they aren't automatically that good at doing other, wildly different things. Given how many of them are now trying to do other, wildly different things, Verizon and Tumblr should be a cautionary tale. This won't be the last ugly asset sell-off.The Facebook Deal That Wasn'tWhich leads me to the deal that didn't happen. What's best about this is that it finally gives me a reason to write something sort of positive about one particularly problematic behemoth, Facebook. Why so grateful and positive? Because Zuckerberg's Gang That Can't Code Straightdidn'tbuy the cool group-chat site Houseparty[8]. Word leaked that Facebook decided against further deal talks earlier this year because it might lead to still more heat over antitrust issues[9]. Houseparty instead was bought by Epic, which owns Fortnite. I'm skeptical that more regulatory attention on Facebook will lead to anything substantive (that record $5 billion fine[10] they just paid was barely double their quarterly profits;share prices rose after the announcement), But at least the scotched deal shows Facebook isn't completely, hopelessly arrogant and tone-deaf. Nonetheless, Facebook is still lining up other cringe-worthy things, like trying to hornswoggle newspapers into a News initiative. Under the initiative, Facebook is offering big papers up to $3 million in actual cash for their valuable news product[11]. It's refreshing that Facebook is finally offering to pay a bit for the news from which it has made so much (unshared) money. But Facebook has a really crummy habit of starting things and pulling the plug on creators a year later. This one smells a lot like it'll be another of those. I'm begging my print brethren to remember who they're dealing with. Perhaps sense will prevail. And of course, we just saw another instance of a Facebook-owned outlet being used to screw with someone's election[12], in this case Whats App and Nigeria, one of the world's most populous countries. Facebook also is doubling down on its Portal initiative, planning to release new 'form factors' of thevideo-chat hardware this fall. I'll say it again: after all the mayhem Facebook has committed with and on your personal and private information, do you really want to pay these goofs for the privilege of putting an always-on, Internet-connected camera, screen and microphone in your home? I mean, in just the past week, Facebook acknowledged paying hundreds of contractors to create transcripts of the conversations their gear was overhearing[13]. And it stirred a member of Congress to request that Zuckerberg clear up 'incomplete' testimony given earlier this year[14] that initially didn't refer to such monitoring. That'snot great, especially given their shoddy track record. Buy accordingly. But at least Facebook didn't get to join the Houseparty, or vice versa. That's a win for the Republic. In an era where gigantism will only continue (even if on the reduced scale of ViacomCBS), and big companies will make bad deals (like Tumbling into Yahoo and then Verizon), at least once in a while the best outcome of all can happen: nothing at all.<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/201904TFTipaltiThis\">http://bit.ly/201904TFTipaltiThis</url> installment ofInsightsis brought to you by Tipalti[15],automating creator payments for the video industry.

The goods being shifted are just as likely to be paracetamol and potatoes.</p><p>Nairobi is famous as a pioneer of Mpesa mobile money, which is credited with drawing millions of unbanked people into the formal financial sector. That has not only helped poorer Kenyans move small amounts of money to each other and between themselves and vendors. It has also enabled many to access services from micro-credit to electricity via small solar panels, with instalments settled by mobile phone.</p><p>Now, say those involved in the sector, Kenya is moving into a new phase in which non-tech companies \u2014 from farming to pharmaceuticals \u2014 can use the country\u2019s IT infrastructure to invent new ways of doing business.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere was a lot of hype about Silicon Savannah, but a lot of those early start-ups flamed out,\u201d says Grant Brooke, chief executive of online farm produce marketplace Twiga Foods, referring to the nickname for Kenya\u2019s fast growing technology sector. \u201cNow the people who were part of that are ready to build serious companies.\u201d</p><p>Companies can draw on a pool of well-qualified IT developers. They also operate in an environment in which those on modest incomes are used to paying for things electronically. Smartphone penetration is high, and nine in 10 adults own a mobile.</p><p>Uber Eats, the food delivery app business that is part of the US ride-hailing company, chose to launch its second sub-Saharan operation in Kenya last month precisely because of consumers\u2019 strong appetite for online services. \u201cIt is testament to the technological savvyness of Kenyans,\u201d says Amal Devani, east Africa general manager for Uber Eats, of the company\u2019s decision to launch in Nairobi. It already operates in South Africa.</p><p>Joe Mucheru, minister for information and communications, jokes that more elderly people are getting their eyes tested as a direct result of mobile and e-services. Few, he says, are willing to entrust their Personal Identification Number to relatives, since PINs are used for all sorts of online government services and payments: they would prefer to do it themselves, even if it means a trip to the opticians. Moving to e-services also helps tackle corruption, he adds.</p><p>Twiga is using an online marketplace to solve a simple but serious problem. According to the World Economic Forum, Kenyans spend on average 47 per cent of their income on food. This makes them extremely vulnerable to food inflation. Mr Brooke argues that partly reflects low farming yields, which he compares with those of late-19th century America, as well as poor logistics for getting food to market.\u00a0</p><p>Twiga promises to improve the price that farmers get for crops such as potatoes, bananas and onions, while simultaneously providing urban vendors with a reliable supply of fresh vegetables at a discount. \u201cWe\u2019re creating certainty for farmers. That does the most good,\u201d says Mr Brooke, adding that only if farmers know they can sell their produce regularly and transparently will they invest in the new seed, fertiliser and irrigation needed to increase yields.</p><p>The market is fragmented with approximately 130,000 merchants buying vegetables for Nairobi alone. Twiga\u2019s platform aggregates orders \u2014 currently it supplies about 1,500 vendors \u2014 and creates a marketplace that cuts out layers of intermediaries. Twiga combines online with offline, with collection points around the country. That has cut post-harvest losses for signed-up farmers from 30 per cent to 4 per cent, Mr Brooke estimates. \u201cThat\u2019s where we get most of our margins.\u201d</p><p>MyDawa, a health tech company launched this year with start-up capital from Ion Equity, a Dublin-based private equity firm, wants to do for pharmaceuticals what Twiga is doing for vegetables. It also seeks to use technology to cut out layers of middlemen, this time those that exist between pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients.</p><p>Inefficiency raises the price of drugs, often beyond the ability of ordinary Kenyans to afford them. It also increases the risk that sub-standard or fake medicines enter the supply chain. MyDawa has a digital platform \u2014 built with local expertise \u2014 and its own warehouses from which medicines are dispatched. The company\u2019s head of IT, 32-year-old Nicky Nyamasyo, studied at Egerton University in Nakuru. </p><p>MyDawa\u2019s system authenticates medicines through a QR code tracking system that sends patients a text message confirming the product is genuine. Tony Wood, managing director, says it \u201ccan squeeze fakes out of the supply chain\u201d. The company chose to start in Kenya, he says, \u201cbecause of the easy adoption of technology\u201d by consumers. </p><p>Big Tech has spotted the potential. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, made a visit to the city in 2016, he declared Kenya a \u201cworld leader\u201d in mobile money. Mr Zuckerberg is among the backers of Bridge, a Nairobi-headquartered company that seeks to use technology to improve low-cost private education. </p><p>Other companies have used Kenya as a staging post. In May, Cellulant, a digital payments provider that started out in Kenya and Nigeria, raised $47.5m from the Rise Fund, run by private equity group TPG Growth, to help its Africa expansion plans. </p><p>Kenya is two to three years ahead of other African markets, says Ken Njoroge, Cellulant\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAnd most of that is driven by the fact that mobile money and the mobile payments ecosystem is more mature, customers are educated and regulators are comfortable with it.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-10522994658b11e8bdd1cc0534df682c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD8-TN01-DXP9-94PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><timeReceived>2:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 28, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000576</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N4494111M</classCode><className>INTERNET RETAILING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

This year, among richly compensated Democrats, one percenters on up, that tilts the scale toward Mrs. Clinton.</p><p>  The young techies are a different story. Many are feeling the Bern, and many have registered as ''N.P.P.'' (no party preference) voters, ready for a political revolution.</p><p>  Here is one such voter, Gina Brunelli, on the subject, before a Sanders rally in Palo Alto: ''What turns me off about Hillary is that she's a voice for big corporations and big business, where Bernie is a voice for people. The conversations he's started are worth it,'' she says, meaning conversations about income inequality and college debt.</p><p>  Ron Turiello, a founder of the Voter Genome Project, a political microtargeting outfit, and a progressive who has backed President Obama since his Senate campaign, says he, too, would vote for Mr. Sanders as more in tune with concerns about economic justice, whereas Mrs. Clinton seems more the pro-business, pro-status quo candidate. He fears that if she becomes president, Silicon Valley's heavy hitters -- Big Tech -- will draw the Democratic Party rightward on taxes, regulation and labor issues.</p><p>  ''There's a lot of philanthropy out here,'' he adds. ''But there's also a sense of 'stay out of our way, and let us run our business.' There are strong labor unions out here, like for teachers -- but not in technology.''</p><p>  The idea that Mrs. Clinton is less likely than Mr. Sanders to let government get in the way of the Valley's creativity and enterprise is one of her strongest selling points. Another is her pedigree as a Washington insider.</p><p>  Al Gore, <person><nameText>Bill Clinton's </nameText></person>vice president, was the White House's ambassador to the tech community and helped connect public schools to the internet. In the years since, battles over net neutrality, intellectual property and privacy have shown companies here the value of friends in Washington. This has helped raise millions for Mrs. Clinton, with more on the way.</p><p>  Michelle Kraus, managing partner of Technology &amp; Politics, a global technology industry advisory firm, is a big Clinton fund-raiser and a fervent supporter. What worries her is that infighting -- and the reluctance among many Sanders supporters to entertain compromise -- could do lasting damage to the party. This contest, she says, has seen the factions within the Democratic Party ''spin themselves into whirling dervishes,'' with each faction choosing a small set of issues, as a kind of litmus test, to the exclusion of all others.</p><p>  ''Do we have to change the criminal justice system? Yes. Do we have to work on retraining the work force? You betcha. Do we have to end some of the outsourcing? Yeah. Do we have to work on race relations in this country? Oh yeah, big time. But there's enough room at the table to be heard.''</p><p>  Should Mrs. Clinton win the presidency, she says, Mr. Sanders could be ''a beacon to enlarge the tent, to take us forward and backward, to the kinds of coalitions the party has always stood for. Working class. Immigrants. Diversity. With benefits for all.''</p><p>  But peace in the party is essential, she says.</p><p>  ''I'm praying, hoping, wishing and dreaming that we, as my grandmother used to say, get ahold of ourselves.

This year, among richly compensated Democrats, one percenters on up, that tilts the scale toward Mrs. Clinton.</p><p>The young techies are a different story. Many are feeling the Bern, and many have registered as \"N.P.P.\" (no party preference) voters, ready for a political revolution.</p><p>Here is one such voter, Gina Brunelli, on the subject, before a Sanders rally in Palo Alto: \"What turns me off about Hillary is that she's a voice for big corporations and big business, where Bernie is a voice for people. The conversations he's started are worth it,\" she says, meaning conversations about income inequality and college debt.</p><p>Ron Turiello, a founder of the Voter Genome Project, a political microtargeting outfit, and a progressive who has backed President Obama since his Senate campaign, says he, too, would vote for Mr. Sanders as more in tune with concerns about economic justice, whereas Mrs. Clinton seems more the pro-business, pro-status quo candidate. He fears that if she becomes president, Silicon Valley's heavy hitters - Big Tech - will draw the Democratic Party rightward on taxes, regulation and labor issues.</p><p>\"There's a lot of philanthropy out here,\" he adds. \"But there's also a sense of 'stay out of our way, and let us run our business.' There are strong labor unions out here, like for teachers - but not in technology.\"</p><p>The idea that Mrs. Clinton is less likely than Mr. Sanders to let government get in the way of the Valley's creativity and enterprise is one of her strongest selling points. Another is her pedigree as a Washington insider.</p><p>Al Gore, <person><nameText>Bill Clinton's </nameText></person>vice president, was the White House's ambassador to the tech community and helped connect public schools to the internet. In the years since, battles over <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/net_neutrality/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">net neutrality</url>, intellectual property and privacy have shown companies here the value of friends in Washington. This has helped raise millions for Mrs. Clinton, with more on the way.</p><p>Michelle Kraus, managing partner of Technology &amp; Politics, a global technology industry advisory firm, is a big Clinton fund-raiser and a fervent supporter. What worries her is that infighting - and the reluctance among many Sanders supporters to entertain compromise - could do lasting damage to the party. This contest, she says, has seen the factions within the Democratic Party \"spin themselves into whirling dervishes,\" with each faction choosing a small set of issues, as a kind of litmus test, to the exclusion of all others.</p><p>\"Do we have to change the criminal justice system? Yes. Do we have to work on retraining the work force? You betcha. Do we have to end some of the outsourcing? Yeah. Do we have to work on race relations in this country? Oh yeah, big time. But there's enough room at the table to be heard.\"</p><p>Should Mrs. Clinton win the presidency, she says, Mr. Sanders could be \"a beacon to enlarge the tent, to take us forward and backward, to the kinds of coalitions the party has always stood for. Working class. Immigrants. Diversity. With benefits for all.\"</p><p>But peace in the party is essential, she says.</p><p>\"I'm praying, hoping, wishing and dreaming that we, as my grandmother used to say, get ahold of ourselves. Because there is just too much at stake.\"</p><p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion\">Twitter</url>, and sign up for the      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/\">Opinion Today newsletter</url>. <br/></p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/opinion/campaign-stops/will-sanders-go-gentle.html\">Will Sanders Go Gentle?</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000004454793</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MBN-7KY1-DXY4-X0F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 7, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Editorial</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Clinton, Hillary Rodham</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Editorials</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Silicon Valley (Calif)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Income Inequality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Clinton, Hillary Rodham</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential Election of 2016</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096UR</classCode><className>INCOME DISTRIBUTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009HPF</classCode><className>EDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp;

He is a conservative, and like many other technologists here, he adheres to the long-standing Silicon Valley belief in a free and open Web, unhindered by government interference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But things changed in wake of violence in Charlottesville, when one technology company after another shut down or cut off service to right-wing accounts and sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, Torba is part of a growing chorus of right-leaning technologists and leaders who have started to sound more like liberals when they talk about Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Events in Charlottesville and at Google, where an employee was fired for disparaging the company's diversity policies, have pushed them toward an unexpected battle cry: Tell the government to force powerful Internet companies to allow anyone to express themselves on their platforms.</p><p> The issue is beginning to percolate in Washington. And it is expected to take center stage this weekend when right-wing protesters are planning to descend on the liberal heart of the nation's tech sector. The groups are holding rallies in San Francisco on Saturday and near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley on Sunday.</p><p> The Saturday event in San Francisco, organized by Patriot Prayer, a group from Portland, Ore., is billed as a free speech rally, while organizers of the Berkeley gathering are calling it a \"No to Marxism\" march on their Facebook page. </p><p>The leaders for both rallies wrote on Facebook that the KKK and neo-Nazis were not welcome. (They did not respond to requests for comment).</p><p>             \"The tech companies should stop censoring users that they politically disagree with or governments should regulate them as public utilities,\" Torba's spokesman Utsav Sanduja said. Last year, Sanduja and Torba founded Gab.ai, an alternative social network for free speech advocates. \"Imagine if a private corporation owned all the highways and they decided to close them down whenever they feel like it - that is what it's like. You cannot deny people a fundamental staple of the Internet.\"</p><p>The language by the Gab founders and other conservatives mirrors Democrats' long-standing arguments that telecommunications infrastructure should be treated as a public good. But liberals have been more hands off when it comes to social media and other Silicon Valley-provided services.</p><p>Conservatives have always been an anomaly in Silicon Valley, but they've been particularly vilified since <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>election.</p><p>Many say they purposely hide their political beliefs from colleagues and peers.  </p><p>For instance, after their election night party held in Twitter headquarters near downtown San Francisco, local GOP leaders said they advised victorious attendees to consider removing their red Make America Great Again hats before they went back out on the city's main thoroughfare.</p><p> \"It's like being gay in the 1950s,\" said one prominent conservative technologist who spoke on the condition that he not be named.</p><p>Some in Silicon Valley - who say they do not espouse the talking points of the \"alt-right\" or support the positions of the neo-Nazi organizers of the Charlottesville rally - say they are being roped in with extremists and that their voices have been drowned out. They say that tech giants are becoming the online enforcers of a liberal point of view and the gatekeepers of all political expression, with little checks on their power.</p><p> \"For many on the right, not just the fringe but the mainstream, Silicon Valley just has no credibility when it comes to policing public speech because of the way that 'Big Tech's' internal culture seems to close down private speech - the sense that tech firms are the enemies of free expression if you have a viewpoint that diverges from standard liberal ideology,\" said Steve Hilton, a Fox News host based in Silicon Valley and chief executive of Crowdpac, a political fundraising website.</p><p>Torba, an outspoken Trump supporter who calls himself a Christian conservative, was kicked out of the prominent technology incubator Y-Combinator after calling fellow entrepreneurs in the community \"cucks\" and using the f-word in a heated Facebook discussion about racism after the election. </p><p>Y-Combinator said Torba was harassing fellow entrepreneurs. Torba said he was kicked out for espousing conservative views.</p><p> Like many fellow engineers, Torba has long believed that tech start-ups thrive with as little government regulation as possible. But he started to change his mind, Sanduja said, after the company's app was rejected from Apple's app store in January. In rejecting the app, Apple said Gab had violated its policies by hosting pornographic material, among other reasons.</p><p>Last week, Google also banned Gab from the Google Play Store, citing violations of the company's hate speech policies. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin had become an active user on Gab after a succession of companies refused to service his site. Other controversial right-wing figures, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew \"weev\" Auernheimer, also are on Gab.</p><p> Gab.ai has raised over a million dollars in contributions since last month, Sanduja said.</p><p> The atmosphere for conservatives became a lot more complex after the Charlottesville protests, in which dozens were injured and one woman was killed after a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car into a crowd of demonstrators.</p><p> In response to the protests, a striking number of technology companies, from Facebook to PayPal to Google to GoDaddy and even OkCupid - blocked or shut down service to alt-right and white supremacist accounts. </p><p>The move reflected a stunning turnabout for the tech industry, which has long been reluctant to police their platforms in this way, even as most have policies prohibiting hate speech.</p><p> Conservatives were already fuming from events two weeks earlier, when James Damore, a Google engineer, was fired by the search giant after publishing a long memo in a corporate chat room in which he protested the company's diversity policies and promoted negative stereotypes about women.</p><p>The calls for more federal oversight of tech giants have made their way to Washington.</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said in recent weeks that he was worried about \"large tech companies putting their thumb on the scales and skewing political and public discourse.\" </p><p>In the days after Charlottesville, alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer made populist calls to regulate tech giants and decried tech monopolies. Former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon reportedly made similar assertions earlier this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, a memo about turning the regulation of Internet companies into a GOP plank recently circulated among operatives in Washington, according to several news reports.</p><p>Democrats have also called for more regulation of Wall Street but until recently have largely taken a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley. Now they too are becoming more willing to criticize technology companies. </p><p>Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) recently called for greater scrutiny of Amazon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has honed in on tech monopolies. Strengthening antitrust enforcement was part of new populist-leaning policy proposals put forth by Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).</p><p> All of this means that Silicon Valley, which for so long has enjoyed the support of the public and politicians alike, may have a more fraught path in Washington.</p><p> \"The more that they drift down these lines, the more they will attract political enemies and that will lead to more regulations,\" said Aaron Ginn, the co-founder and president of the Lincoln Network, which seeks to use technology to promote liberty in the public space. </p><p>Ginn does not agree with the calls to regulate tech monopolies. Tech companies, he said, \"are encouraging political tribalism and the splintering of tech products previously viewed as agnostic.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-047b6e1a892111e7a94f3139abce39f5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PB2-DVR1-DXKP-J4YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><timeReceived>11:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 24, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Continue reading Instacart May Stop Service If Seattle OKs Hazard Pay Fee</p><p>Seattle s City Council is debating a bill to force eCommerce ordering and transportation platforms like Instacart and Uber to give drivers at least $5  premium pay  for each trip made during      the pandemic and until as long as 2023.</p><p>Now, Instacart is threatening to halt operations there rather than pay up.</p><p> If this measure passes, Instacart may not be able to sustainably operate in Seattle,  Instacart said in a statement to PYMNTS.  It s unfortunate that the Seattle City Council has chosen to      introduce this misguided legislation in the throes of a global pandemic, a widespread economic crisis, and civil unrest in the city. </p><p>City Council member Andrew Lewis said in a press release announcing his support for the measure that  frontline workers across the country, from medical professionals to grocery store workers,      have received hazard pay to compensate for increased exposure to coronavirus during this pandemic. Our frontline drivers, from food delivery drivers to those who get us from A to B, should also      be recognized for being on the frontlines of this pandemic. </p><p>The proposed legislation calls for companies to pay the $5 bonus until the City Council either repeals the measure or until March 3, 2023, the third anniversary of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan      declaring COVID-19 an emergency.</p><p>But Instacart in particular is taking a hard line against the idea, threatening to pull up stakes from the Emerald City if it becomes law.</p><p>The debate comes as consumers are buying more online than ever before. Growing numbers of consumers surveyed by PYMNTS report buying online, which presumably involves delivery. Approximately      half of consumers we polled (48.2 percent) have shifted more of their shopping online, and 63.3 percent say they ll maintain some of those digital behaviors even after COVID-19 passes. More      than two-thirds (67.4 percent) specifically endorsed order-ahead for delivery services.</p><p>The Seattle proposal also comes as   Big Tech  has become a code word for  Bad Tech  among some politicians, regulators and the media,  as Karen Webster recently noted.</p><p>But Instacart vows it s not going down without a fight.

Yes, you do. Social media platforms including Instagram and Tumblr have been wrestling with these challenges since 2012, if not before, and a clear strategy on how to self-regulate seems to have eluded them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/6b172ab3-c4e3-42a8-9a17-229fd091ec11.html\">Apparent bans on graphic content</url> have clearly not worked in the past and one can only hope that this time, the commitment is real rather than PR spiel.</p><p>At least the Facebook-owned Instagram can be seen to be taking action. But what about other platforms, most of which seem either ill-equipped or reluctant to take proactive measures to help protect their vast userbases from harmful content?\u00a0Few have reacted to Instagram's backing of a regulatory Duty of Care so far.</p><p>With all the attention that's being paid to Instagram, it seems that the harm being done on\u00a0'closed' social networks such as Whatsapp and Snapchat, is being ignored.\u00a0</p><p>These apps use\u00a0'end-to-end-encryption' which means messages between people are hidden and even WhatsApp can't read them. As a result, spotting abusive and dangerous content is almost impossible. What are these sites doing to live up to their Duty of Care?</p><p>It's not just these closed networks.\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/6b172ab3-c4e3-42a8-9a17-229fd091ec11.html\">The Telegraph discovered just last week</url> that despite an apparent ban on self-harm videos on video hosting platform YouTube, they were being recommended to users as young as 13.</p><p>It was only after contact from this newspaper that certain search results relating to self-harm were removed.</p><p>Flags on sites such as Instagram and YouTube are supposed to appear to guide users away from harmful content and seek help, but are notoriously unreliable.</p><p>If nothing else, this suggests that many online, largely user-generated platforms simply grew too big, too fast to deal with the risks.</p><p>Without measures to regulate harmful content baked into the platform from the beginning, the job to retroactively address the issues simply became too complex.</p><p>Social media companies then fell back on a hands-off approach as users continued to soar, possibly in the blithe hope that harmful content would be buried or ignored.</p><p>It's why platforms like Facebook are using artificial intelligence to flag content as wide-ranging as cyber-bullying, hate speech and child trafficking.</p><p>AI will form a large part of Instagram's new policy, but the technology is currently limited, particularly against savvy users that can circumnavigate certain restrictions.</p><p>Noone is saying this is going to be easy, especially when it comes to encrypted closed-network social platforms such as WhatsApp and Snapchat. These apps are private by design and that privacy is a constant concern, particularly as big tech companies come under fire for 'snooping' on users via a host of tracking apps.</p><p>The balance between protecting privacy and regulating harmful content is going to be a stringent challenge for social media companies, should they choose to take Instagram's lead.</p><p>But sympathy for that task runs dry. This is largely a situation of their own making; a failure of proactive thinking as their platforms became entwined with everyday life.</p><p>Mr Mosseri talked of the 'good' offered by social networks over the past ten years.</p><p>On that point, he is not wrong; helping friends and family stay connected, broadening horizons and even bringing us closer to our personal heroes or political representatives.</p><p>But as social media becomes increasingly part of everyday life, platforms cannot remain blind to the risks and responsibility of such success.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51574964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCJ-XVP1-JCJY-G3SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><timeReceived>1:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

So they're fighting back. And before you write off <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/unionizedmemes/\">IG Meme Union Local 69-420</url> as a joke, the organizers of the collective would like you to know that they are very serious.</p><p><br/>\"Solidarity actions with memers. Memers of the world unite,\" the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/unionizedmemes/\">Instagram page</url> for the union reads, encouraging followers to \"seize the memes of production.\"<br/>The IG Meme Union will probably never be recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, but organizers say it can still act as a union for all intents and purposes. \"We're calling it a union and doing union-organizing tactics,\" Paul Praindo, a representative of the organizing committee, told me. \"We stand in firm support of others who are working to organize anti-labor industries. We think these movements mark the beginning of a labor renaissance.\" Some other \"unions\" function this way: The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freelancersunion.org/\">Freelancers Union</url>, for instance, doesn't have a formal management structure to negotiate with, but does advocate collectively for independent workers.<br/>Similarly, the IG Meme Union, which is currently taking applications through       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://form.jotform.com/90996710938169\">an online form</url>, hopes to negotiate better working conditions for memers who say they have been exploited by Instagram and other tech platforms for too long. \"People are doing a lot of work, doing it for free or little compensation, or not recognized for the work they're doing,\" Praindo said. \"All these people are bringing revenue to Instagram, producing this major profit margin for this company, and they're subject to really little job security.\"<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/07/why-some-of-instagrams-biggest-memers-are-locking-their-accounts/564995/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why some of Instagram's biggest memers are locking their accounts</url>]<br/>Instagram follows the same business model as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other social platforms. The service itself is free to use, but the platform monetizes the content posted to it to sell ads based on metadata attached to that content. Users themselves, who are the ones posting the photos, videos, and memes that keep people coming back to the app, don't get a cut of that revenue.<br/>\"We as content creators want to have worker protections,\" Praindo said. \"Even if you're producing funny pictures of Shrek, that should not determine whether you're taken seriously as a creator or your livelihood is imperiled at the drop of a hat ... We are a meme union; the whole point of it is to work for protections for other content creators.\"<br/>Instagram declined to say explicitly on the record whether it supports the union. Instead, a company spokesperson offered a statement: \"We're always listening to feedback from the community,\" it said. \"We're happy to have the feedback so we can improve. Hearing these concerns is useful for us.\"<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwFsDYbA5Uo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwFsDYbA5Uo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">View this post on Instagram</url><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwFsDYbA5Uo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">and non-binary feudal lords</url><br/>A post shared by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/unionizedmemes/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">IG Meme Union Local 69-420</url> (@unionizedmemes) on Apr 10, 2019 at 1:44pm PDT<br/><br/>A few things the IG Meme Union wants: a more open and transparent appeals process for account bans; a direct line of support with Instagram, or a dedicated liaison to the meme community; and a better way to ensure that original content isn't monetized by someone else. \"Having a public and clear appeal process is a big thing,\" Praindo said. \"People appeal now and get turned down, and they won't know why.\" (In a statement, an Instagram spokesperson said, \"Each week we review millions of reports and there are times when we make mistakes.\" She also said the company would soon be rolling out an option to appeal post removals.)<br/>So far, the union's message has been well received by the broader meme community. Administrators for accounts with millions of followers said they support the group's efforts and would stand in solidarity with them. \"I think the union is a good thing. There should be something like this,\" said       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/Sonny5ideUp/\">Sonny5ideUp</url>, a memer with more than 1 million followers on Instagram. Jackson Weimer, a writer for Meme Insider who has also created several successful Instagram meme pages, said he thinks the union is a \"good idea\" and a necessary way to get Instagram to finally take memers seriously.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKZXyJlfQW/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKZXyJlfQW/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">View this post on Instagram</url><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKZXyJlfQW/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">this is what those ping-pong playing craft beer drinking tots relatable silicon valley ayahuasca over sharing hipster bosses will say to you when you try to assert your right to collective bargaining. don't fall for the good guy bullshit your boss tries to pull. they aren't your friend. your workplace isnt a \"family\". your paycheck is thinner than their blood. cut all sentimental ties with that shit bc when push comes to shove, and they need to cut costs, your ass will be on the chopping block. if it was a 'family' then your well-being, your concerns and your needs would be met with material return; you'd be getting paid more, you'd have full benefits, your job would be secure and they wouldn't threaten to fire you if you formed a union. don't let company paintball trips compensate for workplace neglect/abuse.</url><br/>A post shared by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/blackpowerbottomtext/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading\">nicol\u00c3\u00a1s \u00e2\u02dc\u00ad</url> (@blackpowerbottomtext) on Apr 12, 2019 at 9:37am PDT<br/><br/>Memers represent a burgeoning sector of the labor force that currently has no job security or formal protection. \"If you're spending all your time as a Twitch broadcaster or creating memes, that is work,\" says John Ahlquist, an associate professor at the University of San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy, who has done research on the changing nature of work. \"People that are trying to earn a living on these platforms are recognizing how vulnerable they are on an individual basis with respect to the platform, and so they're turning to this tried-and-true model of collective action.\"<br/>Memers aren't direct employees of these tech platforms, nor are they independent contractors for them. But they produce, directly or indirectly, the bulk of these platforms' income. And current labor protections don't cover this type of \"mediated work,\" Ahlquist told me.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/memes-are-becoming-harder-to-monetize/561578/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Memes are becoming harder to monetize</url>]<br/>\"All the basic labor-market regulations we have in place to try to give people fallback in the event of illness or the recession or aging-they're all designed and counted under a particular set of contractual arrangements that no longer fit many people,\" he said. \"That labor contract [and those jobs] looks like things we're familiar with from the middle of the 20th century.\"<br/>This isn't the first time internet influencers and creators have tried to band together to make their voices heard-with varying results. Top YouTubers often join multichannel networks, which bargain for higher rates and facilitate a direct line to YouTube. In 2015,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://amp.businessinsider.com/vines-biggest-stars-tried-saving-company-2016-10\">more than 20 of Vine's top stars joined together to attempt to negotiate a payment structure from the app</url>. When talks broke down between the Viners and the platform, they walked; Vine's user base and engagement plummeted, and the app later shuttered. In 2016, more than 100 top Facebook pages reaching more than 10 million users collectively banded together to form the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://memealliance.org/\">Meme Alliance</url>, which argued for more transparent enforcement of the platform's community standards. Facebook did end up revamping its moderation policies, though it did not directly acknowledge the Meme Alliance.<br/>While previous efforts by small groups of creators may have stalled, William Fitzgerald, a volunteer with the Tech Workers Coalition, a worker-led organizing group for the tech industry, told me that the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/unionizedmemes/\">IG Meme Union</url> is forming at an optimal time.

They said that while there was a lot of anger against big tech, Warren's proposal wasn't \"nuanced\" enough. \"Breaking companies up is a very specific prescription for a very specific problem,\" said Systrom. AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Calls to break up tech giants like Google and Facebook are overly simplistic and unlikely to be effective, according to the creators of Instagram, one of the most high-profile tech acquisitions of recent years. </p><p>\"Being big, in and of itself, is not a crime,\" Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom said on stage Monday at the SXSW festival in response to a question about presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's recent proposal to split up [5]powerful tech companies. Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger sold Instagram to Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion. After working at Facebook for several years and helping to turn the photo-sharing app into one of the world's most popular social media services, Systrom and Krieger left Facebook last year amid differences over strategy and direction.[6] When asked if he supported the thrust of Warren's proposal at SXSW[7] on Monday, Systrom initially said \"Do we get our job back?,\" before clarifying that he was joking. Systrom acknowledged that while there was a lot of anger against big tech \u2014 whether due to Russian meddling in elections or rising property prices \u2014 that doesn't mean that the companies ought to be broken up. \"We live in a time where I think the anger against big tech has increased tenfold,\" he said. \"Breaking companies up is a very specific prescription for a very specific problem.\" He added that if the objective was to fix economic issues or Russian interference, there were other ways of doing that. But he said that companies shouldn't be penalized merely for their size, and that Warren's solution was \"not nuanced enough\" and shows \"that the understanding of the problem isn't there.\"\"Better ideas came out because of it\"Talk of regulating Silicon Valley has dominated SXSW this year, with Warren's proposal to break up Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook coming up in conversation at almost every panel. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti, for instance, said on Friday that platforms and media need to work together. Read More:'The people at the platforms are good people': BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti responds to Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the tech giants[8] Systrom said that doesn't mean that companies shouldn't be broken up if they get too big, or are monopolies and can cause problems. But that it was going to take some more thought. \"It's going to take a more nuanced proposal, but my fear is that something like a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone's current feeling of anti-tech, rather than doing what I think politicians should do, which is address real problems and give real solutions,\" he said. And Systrom said that his company's marriage with Facebook made Instagram a better product. \"Better ideas came out because of it \u2014 we grew both companies, not just one company,\" he said. \"I think there's a strong argument that, in fact, the acquisition worked out for consumers.\" Krieger too shared his thoughts, saying that there needed to be clarity on the specific problems that Warren's plan was trying to solve, and that different problems required different solutions. \"Is it about Amazon white-labeling products inside Amazon?,\" said Krieger. \"Because that's a very different problem than whether Facebook should also own Instagram, which is a really different problem than whether Apple has the right to be one App Store only.\"NOW WATCH: What El Chapo is really

BI monitored IGTV over a three-week period and found its algorithmrecommended disturbing and potentially illegal videos. Two of the videos, featuring suggestive footage of young girls, were reported to the police by a leading children's charity over concerns they broke the law. Instagram took five days to remove the videos, and apologised to users who saw them. </p><p>The Facebook-owned app said it wants IGTV to be a \"safe place for young people.\" British lawmaker Damian Collins, who led the inquiry into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data breach, described BI's findings as \"very disturbing.\" Readers should be warned that some of the details in this report may be upsetting. Instagram's new TV service recommended a crop of graphic and disturbing videos, including what appeared to be child exploitation and genital mutilation. That's the finding of a Business Insider investigation into IGTV, which launched in June as Instagram attempts to muscle in on rivals like YouTube and Snapchat.[1] BI spent nearly three weeks monitoring the Facebook-owned video service, during which time IGTV's algorithm recommended questionable content, including sexually suggestive footage of young girls and an explicit video of a mutilated penis. Two of the videos discovered by BI were reported to the police by theNational Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), aBritish children's charity, and were eventually removed by Instagram five days after BI reported them through the app's official reporting channel. Instagram apologised to users who saw the videos and said it wants to make IGTV a safe space for young people. The findings come at a time when Facebook is under extraordinary scrutiny over inappropriate content on its platforms. Facebook and Instagram share a community operations team, and Mark Zuckerberg's company has hired an army of 7,500 moderators and is using AI to snuff out posts that break its guidelines. Earlier this year, former Facebook moderator Sarah Katz told Business Insider that she had to review 8,000 posts a day and it made her numb to child abuse.[2] But despite the intense oversight, and resources Facebook is ploughing into policing its platforms, disturbing content appears to be slipping the net \u2014 and, as in the case of IGTV, even being suggested to users.IGTV's content recommendation machineInstagram launched IGTV in June[3], and was viewed by many as Facebook moving in on YouTube's territory. It allows users to set up their own channels and upload video of up to an hour in length. Anyone with an Instagram account can make a channel, and users swipe through them much like flicking through channels on a television. IGTV recommends content in three ways: A \"For You\" tab, which plays videos as soon as you open IGTV; a \"Popular\" section; and a \"Following\" menu, which offers videos from people you follow. Instagram did not answer Business Insider's questions on how IGTV's algorithm recommends certain videos and why videos were suggested that appeared to be child exploitation. But it appears that the For You section recommends things users will like, possibly based on past activity. The Popular tab seems to gather trending content from across IGTV.Users can scroll through the recommended videos by swiping left, or IGTV will automatically play the next video. It is clearly designed to encourage scrolling and continued viewing, in much the same way that the YouTube algorithm recommends content through its Up Next bar.Disturbing videos of young girlsBusiness Insider monitored the For You and Popular tabs for almost three weeks to establish what kinds of content IGTV's algorithm was serving up for users. We did so in two ways: Firstly through the account of this author and other BI journalists, and secondly an anonymous login set up as a child's account. This second account had no activity history on Instagram and a user age set to 13, which is the earliest people can officially sign up on the app. Within days of monitoring IGTV through Business Insider accounts, a video appeared in the For You section, titled \"Hot Girl Follow Me.\" It showed a young girl, we speculate to have been 11 or 12, in a bathroom. She glanced around her before going to take her top off. Just as she's about to remove her clothing, the video ends. The video, uploaded by a user Business Insider is not naming for legal reasons, also appeared under the Popular tab on IGTV. It was also one of the first videos recommended under the For You section to the child account set up by BI, which had no prior history of activity on Instagram. The same user that uploaded the \"Hot Girl Follow Me\" video posted another video, titled \"Patli Kamar follow me guys plzz,\" which was also recommended to our child Instagram account under the For You section. It featured another clearly underage girl, exposing her belly and pouting for the camera. The same two videos were separately uploaded by a different user, who again Business Insider has chosen not to identify. The video named \"Hot Girl Follow Me\" was called \"Follow me guys\" by this second user, and was also circulating on IGTV's suggested posts. Comments on the videos show they were being recommended to other IGTV users. They were also being interpreted by other users as sexually suggestive. Some condemned the videos and questioned why they had been suggested. \"BRO SHE'S LIKE FUCKING 10 WHY THE FUCK IS THIS IN MY INSTAGRAM RECOMMENDED,\" said one user, commenting on the \"Hot Girl Follow Me\" video. Others were more predatory in tone. \"Superb,\" one user commented on the \"Patli Kamar follow me guys plzz\" video. \"Sexy grl,\" another added. The NSPCC, which is frequently involved in law enforcement activities around child abuse, reviewed the videos and reported them to the police. It was concerned that they could constitute illegal indecent images under UK law because they appeared to feature footage of erotic posing. \"This is yet another example of Instagram falling short by failing to remove content that breaches its own guidelines,\" an NSPCC spokeswoman said. Business Insider reported the videos through Instagram's official reporting function. Because there was no obvious criteria for alerting the company to potential child exploitation, they were logged as \"nudity or pornography.\" The videos remained online for five days. It was only after Business Insider contacted Instagram's press office that the content was removed. By this time, the two videos \u2014 and other versions uploaded by the second user \u2014 had racked up more than 1 million views. Instagram left the accounts that posted the videos active, however. Business Insider asked why the accounts were left up, as Instagram has a \"zero tolerance policy\" on child abuse. Instagram said the policy applies to the content itself and not to the account that uploads it. \"Instagram's zero tolerance policy towards child abuse content is the right one, and it must make sure its policy is enforced in practice,\" an NSPCC spokeswoman said. \"Where Instagram has removed child abuse content from an account, we would expect that account to be reviewed by a moderator to establish whether the account should also be suspended.\" As of this week, the two accounts remain active. They continue to post sexually suggestive content, but not of the same nature as the \"Hot Girl Follow Me\" and \"Patli Kamar follow me guys plzz\" videos.A graphic video of genital mutilationPotential child exploitation is not the only questionable content being recommended by IGTV's algorithm. One of the first videos recommended to Business Insider's anonymous account, registered to a user aged 13, was graphic footage of a penis undergoing an operation involving a motorized saw.The penis appeared to have a metal lug nut affixed around its middle, above which it was extremely swollen and dark red in colour. The bolt was being removed with a round electric saw by what appeared to be a medic. It was quickly wiped from IGTV after being reported by Business Insider as nudity, although the account that uploaded it remained live. Another recommended video showed a baby lying on the floor, wailing inconsolably, with a monkey standing over and touching it. Adults were stood around in a circle, shouting and filming the scene on their phones while the monkey occasionally lashed out at them. Instagram found that the video was not in breach of guidelines, but discovered the account that uploaded it was linked to a different account that had previously been taken down for breaching community guidelines. For this reason, Instagram took the account down.\"Very disturbing\"There was a multitude of other questionable recommendations being pushed by IGTV's algorithm. Examples included a video in which a group of men deceived a sex worker into thinking she was going to be arrested, a video of a woman pulling something long and bloody out of her nose, and various sexually suggestive scenes. Business Insider presented its investigation to MP Damian Collins, the British lawmaker who is leading an inquiry into fake news and Facebook's data breach involving Cambridge Analytica. He described the findings as \"very disturbing,\" and said big tech companies need to sink more investment into enforcing their own rules. \"It's a question of the responsibility of the companies to monitor the content that's on their platforms. A lot of the problematic content is already in breach of the community guidelines of these services, but what it shows is that there's not effective enforcement,\" he said. An Instagram spokeswoman said: \"We care deeply about keeping all of Instagram \u2014 including IGTV \u2014 a safe place for young people to get closer to the people and interests they care about. \"We have Community Guidelines in place to protect everyone using Instagram and have zero tolerance for anyone sharing explicit images or images of child abuse. We have removed the videos reported to us and apologise to anyone who may have seen them. \"We take measures to proactively monitor potential violations of our Community Guidelines and just like on the rest of Instagram, we encourage our community to report content that concerns them. We have a trained team of reviewers who work 24/7 to remove anything which violates our terms.\"\"It's not so different from where YouTube was 10 years ago\"It's no secret that social media has a problem with disturbing and illegal material, and tech giants like Facebook have come under fire recently for failing to effectively moderate content at scale. For IGTV, however, the problem isn't just that this material exists, but rather it's being actively suggested by the algorithm.Mike Henry, CEO of video analytics firm OpenSlate, which works with Facebook, said IGTV is still a young service. \"While Instagram is relatively mature, IGTV is a brand new social video platform and will need time to develop its policies and technology. It's not so different from where YouTube was 10 years ago,\" he said. YouTube's child safety policy[4] is broader than Instagram's, for example. Instagram's report function is limited to child nudity, while YouTube's endangerment policy bans \"sexualization of minors,\" which allows scope for reporting images users suspect might be child exploitation. Henry also said Instagram will have to figure out how to better filter its new platform if it hopes to monetize it, especially considering IGTV was touted as a space for influencers[5]. \"Influencers make great video producers with compelling economics and, at scale, a viable canvas for video ad dollars. With the right policies and infrastructure, IGTV has the potential to become a major player,\" he said. For Collins, IGTV's early missteps are evidence that governments need to do more to regulate tech firms. \"These companies are ad services, they make money out of understanding every single thing you could ever want to know about your users so you can target them with advertising. That same technology should surely very easily be able to root out harmful content as well,\" he said. \"They don't do it because there's not been a commercial incentive for them to do it, so they've just not bothered. But what we have to do through regulation is create that incentive, to say 'you've actually got an obligation to do it and if you don't do it then there will be costs for you for not complying, so you need to invest in doing this now.'\"NOW WATCH: Apple might introduce three new iPhones this year \u2014 here's what we know[6]See Also: Facebook is losing its grip on users' attention[7]2 brothers who

In a country that lacks reliable ways to tell who might be a good borrower, these lenders use artificial intelligence and oddly personal data -- like tracking how fast prospective borrowers type on their phones -- to determine who will pay them back. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  With Mr. Bai, they have failed. First he borrowed to start a business. When that went bust, he borrowed to bet on coal, rapeseed oil and sugar on China's futures markets. Soon Mr. Bai began borrowing from one lender to pay another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Today, Mr. Bai is more than $5,000 in debt, on a paycheck of less than $600 a month.</p><p>  ''It's like gambling,'' said Mr. Bai, a university dropout who has cycled through a series of menial jobs like security guard and waiter. ''You start to gamble. Soon you get addicted to it.''</p><p>  With more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.</p><p>  In November, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, stopped companies and people from starting new online cash lending platforms. In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans.</p><p>  China's small loans are piling up. More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People's Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.</p><p>  ''We are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,'' said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.</p><p>  These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about one billion people.</p><p>  China turned to the fast-moving technology sector. Today, thousands of Chinese apps offer cash or financing, often within seconds, based on a wide array of sometimes deeply personal information. China's biggest internet companies and financial names are funding the effort.</p><p>  Two years ago the central bank asked China's most successful internet companies -- including affiliates of the sophisticated online giants Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group -- to create their own credit ratings systems. Since then, it has declined to issue licenses that would formalize those systems, and officials have indicated in local news reports that the plan has fallen short of expectations.</p><p>  Last month, an internet financial association affiliated with the People's Bank of Chinaannounced plans to start a system that would crunch data from China's big tech firms. Few details were provided.</p><p>  The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China. Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.</p><p>  ''The government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers' personal information is everywhere,'' said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing. ''But they don't really know how to change that because the data is already being used.''</p><p>  Mr. Bai of the China Association of Microfinance added that ''some cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.''</p><p>  Last month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.</p><p>  One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users' contacts without permission. The practice ''seriously exposed users' privacy,'' the authorities said.</p><p>  One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.</p><p>  Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to ''use whatever method to deal'' with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.</p><p>  Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>  Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China's most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.</p><p>  One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app -- Yongqianbao, or ''use wallet'' in Chinese -- helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.</p><p>  Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history -- and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.</p><p>  ''It is hard to determine how the machine knows,'' said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, ''but it is much more accurate'' than a traditional loan officer.</p><p>  Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don't pay back -- what Mr. Jiao calls a ''controlled delinquency'' -- help the company by providing data, the company says.</p><p>  Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, ''but there is still a long way to go,'' said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.</p><p>  Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.</p><p>  In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information -- and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.</p><p>  Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. ''It is meant to threaten you,'' Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.</p><p>  Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. ''But at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,'' he said, ''I wanted to borrow.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Bai Shichao, top, a food deliveryman in Beijing, owes more than $5,000 to online lenders, a tally he keeps on the wall of his room, above.

After all, what could be problematic about a short-form video app featuring a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings doing choreographed dances, roller skating, hanging out in influencer mansions and cutting into photorealistic cakes? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The answer turns out to be: Plenty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the past year, as it has become one of the most popular apps in the world, TikTok has accumulated many of the same problems that other large-scale social networks have. In addition to all the harmless Gen Z fun, there are TikTok conspiracy theories, TikTok misinformation and TikTok extremism. There are even activists using TikTok to influence our elections, including a network of teenagers and K-pop fans who claimed they used the app to sabotage President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month by registering for tickets under false identities.</p><p>  All of this might have been overlooked or forgiven, except for one fact. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, one of the largest tech companies in China.</p><p>  TikTok's Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists in recent weeks. Mr. Trump is considering taking steps to ban the app in the United States. Companies including Wells Fargo, and government agencies including the Transportation Security Administration, have instructed their employees to delete TikTok from their work phones because of concerns that it could be used for surveillance or espionage.</p><p>  In response to the mounting pressures, TikTok is wrapping itself in the American flag. The company has hired a small army of lobbyists in Washington, has brought in an American chief executive (the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer) and is reportedly exploring selling a majority stake in the company to American investors.</p><p>  Jamie Favazza, a TikTok spokeswoman, said in a statement that in addition to the chief executive, the social network had an American as its chief information security officer and another as its head of safety.</p><p>  ''We've tripled the number of employees in the U.S. since the start of 2020,'' she said, ''with plans to hire 10,000 more people over the next three years in places like Texas, New York and Florida.''</p><p>  There are legitimate concerns about a Chinese-owned company capturing the attention and data of millions of Americans -- especially one like ByteDance, which has a history of bending the knee to the country's ruling regime. Like all Chinese tech companies, ByteDance is required to abide by Chinese censorship laws, and it could be forced to give user data to the Chinese government under the country's national security law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used to promote pro-China propaganda to young Americans, or censor politically sensitive content.</p><p>  Ms. Favazza said TikTok stored American user data in Virginia and Singapore. She added that the company's content moderation efforts were led by U.S.-based teams and not influenced by any foreign government, and that TikTok had not and would not give data to the Chinese government.</p><p>  There are also reasons to be skeptical of the motives of TikTok's biggest critics. Many conservative politicians, including Mr. Trump, appear to care more about appearing tough on China than preventing potential harm to TikTok users. And Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook, whose executives have warned of the dangers of a Chinese tech takeover, would surely like to see regulators kneecap one of their major competitors.</p><p>  I'll be honest: I don't buy the argument that TikTok is an urgent threat to America's national security. Or, to put it more precisely, I am not convinced that TikTok is inherently more threatening to Americans than any other Chinese-owned app that collects data from Americans. If TikTok is a threat, so are WeChat, Alibaba and League of Legends, the popular video game, whose maker, Riot Games, is owned by China's Tencent.</p><p>  And since banning every Chinese-owned tech company from operating in America wouldn't be possible without erecting our own version of China's Great Wall -- a drastic step that would raise concerns about censorship and authoritarian control -- we need to figure out a way for Chinese apps and American democracy to coexist.</p><p>  Here's an idea: Instead of banning TikTok, or forcing ByteDance to sell it to Americans, why not make an example of it by turning it into the most transparent, privacy-protecting, ethically governed tech platform in existence?</p><p>  As a foreign-owned app, TikTok is, in some ways, easier to regulate than an American tech platform would be. (One way of regulating it, a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, TikTok's predecessor app, is already reportedly underway.) And there is plenty more the U.S. government could do to ensure that TikTok plays a responsible role in our information ecosystem without getting rid of it altogether. It could require the company to open-source key parts of its software, including the machine-learning algorithms that determine which posts users are shown. It could pressure TikTok to submit to regular audits of its data-collection practices, and open up its internal content moderation guidelines for public comment. As Kevin Xu, the author of Interconnected, a blog about United States-China relations, points out, ByteDance could impose strict internal controls to prevent its Chinese employees from accessing any of TikTok's systems, and open-source those controls so that outsiders could verify the separation.</p><p>  Samm Sacks, a cyberpolicy fellow at the centrist think tank New America, told me that some of the solutions being proposed for TikTok -- such as selling itself to American investors -- wouldn't address the core problems. An American-owned TikTok could still legally sell data to third-party data brokers, for example, which could then feed it back to the Chinese authorities.</p><p>  Instead, Ms. Sacks said, the American government should enact a strong federal privacy law that could protect TikTok users' data without banning the app altogether.</p><p>  ''Let's solve for the problems at hand,'' she said. ''If the concern is data security, the best way to secure the data is to put TikTok under the microscope, and put in place really robust and enforceable rules about how they're using and retaining data.''</p><p>  Forcing TikTok to operate in a radically transparent way would go a long way toward assuaging Americans' fears. And it could become a test case for a new model of tech regulation that could improve the accountability and responsibility of not just Chinese-owned tech companies but American ones, too.</p><p>  At its core, a lot of the TikTok fear factor comes down to a lack of information. In March, TikTok announced that it would open ''transparency centers'' where independent auditors could examine its content moderation practices. The company has also begun releasing ''transparency reports,'' similar to those issued by Facebook and Twitter, outlining the various takedown requests it gets from governments around the world.</p><p>  But we still don't know how TikTok's algorithms are programmed, or why they're showing which videos to which users. We don't know how it's using the data it's collecting, or how it makes and enforces its rules. We should know these things -- not just about TikTok, but about American social media apps, too.</p><p>  After all, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat are playing a huge role in the lives of millions of Americans, and for years, they have operated with a degree of secrecy that few other companies of their importance have been allowed. What little we understand about these platforms' inner workings is often learned years after the fact, gleaned from insider leaks or repentant former employees.</p><p>  Some experts see TikTok's current predicament as a chance to change that.</p><p>  ''I think TikTok is a bit of a red herring,'' Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer and a professor at Stanford University, told me in an interview. Ultimately, Mr. Stamos said, the question of what to do about TikTok is secondary to the question of how multinational tech giants in general should be treated.</p><p>  ''This is a chance to come up with a thoughtful model of how to regulate companies that operate in both the U.S. and China, no matter their ownership,'' he said.</p><p>  The debate over TikTok's fate, in other words, should really be a debate about how all of the big tech companies that entertain, inform and influence billions of people should operate, and what should be required of them, whether they're based in China or Copenhagen or California.</p><p>  If we can figure out how to handle TikTok -- an app with a genuinely creative culture, and millions of American young people who love it -- we'll have done a lot more than preserving a world-class time-waster. We'll have figured out a model for getting big tech platforms under control, after years of letting them run amok.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: TikTok's Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny.

And do you believe Press Secretary Jay Carney really believes this?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Today, we are focusing on the savings that millions of consumers have already seen because of the health care law's provisions that produces more value for their health insurance premium dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Most Americans don't agree with Jay Carney. You've heard many horror stories right here ON THE RECORD. And a new Associated Press poll shows 69 percent of the Americans say their premiums are going up. And 59 percent say their health plan and their co-payment or deductible is increasing.</p><p/><p>Joining us is South Carolina<person><nameText>Senator Tim Scott.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>Nice to see you, sir.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM SCOTT, </nameText></person>(R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Thank you, Greta. It's good to be back with you.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So Jay Carney says thinks millions of Americans are seeing savings?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: It is remarkable. There's no way in the world you can add tens of thousands of government employees, have a $400 million website and see premiums go down and not up. If you the look at the facts, the facts are simple. People in South Carolina -- Mr. Hucks from Greenville, South Carolina, sent me a letter. Talked to him for a little while. His premiums are going up by 75 percent. His deductible is going from $10,000 to $25,000. But his premiums are going from $450 to over $800 a month. If he wanted to go to a co-pay plan, lower deductable, $1500 a month for a family of four, he, his wife and two kids.</p><p/><p>Premiums are skyrocketing. But the unfortunate part is premiums are about price. Deductibles and co-pay ands out-of-pocket expenses, those are about the costs. The costs are also exploding. And, unfortunately, we'll see more bad news once the seven million young people do not enroll. Next year, year two, the premiums will be based on the actuarial information, which will be dismal, which means we'll have worse rates and not better rates.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: For my life though, I can't figure it out. Jay Carney is a smart guy.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why would he put his neck out on this? And maybe he would get lucky and the miracle would happen in the next six months and the price will come crashing down and make everybody flush with cash. Right now, it doesn't look like that. So why is he sticking his neck out and saying these things, great savings?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: I have no idea. I can tell you this. If they find a way to control the price on the front end, it means the cost will rise on the back end. You can find a way to get an insurance company to provide an insurance policy that is not rated sufficient. It only means that some how, some way, taxpayers will pick up the tab on the back end.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That is -- the American taxpayers have always been generous with the people who are down-and-out. And as we expand Medicaid, it will cost more.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Someone has to pick up the cost some place.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: In South Carolina alone, if we were to expand Medicaid, we would see another $2 billion in costs over the next two years. There's just no way --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What do you do about those people? I assume that people in South Carolina want healthy people -- people who are poor with health issues --</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- not to be able to get medical care. What do you do?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: I was in Moncks Corner this morning talking about this very topic. One of the things I suggested we do to lower the cost of health insurance, not to talk about health care, but lower the cost of health insurance, we could allow for competition across the state lines and for small business owners to pool their employees together with other small business owners to reduce the rate by about 25 percent.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why didn't we do that?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: That is one of the failures of the pre-Obamacare world. We had an opportunity to addressed things from a free-market perspective, including medical tort reform, and we didn't do it. Now, we're faced with a challenged of trying to reintroduce common sense into the marketplace. And it would work. We could also fund health care, insurance pools in states to provide those with preexisting conditions with more opportunities. The challenges get worse. If you are in a group plan, preexisting conditions are easily absorbed into a large group plan. When in an individual market, there is no group so you have to pay exceedingly higher rates to find your insurance. That is the challenged. That, coupled with out-of-pocket expenses, going from $6,000 or so to as high as 12,000, only means those folks who can't afford insurance, they get the free health care check up but they can't take care of the challenges that they find within that check up, what do we do next? What do they do next?</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: There is a heartbreaker. But let me ask you about something else.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I want to talk to you about the bipartisan budget bill? The Senate has to vote on it this week. I think tomorrow. And under the bill, military retirement benefits will be cut by $6 billion over the next 10 years. Is it going to pass the Senate?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: I think it will probably pass the Senate, watching and listening to my colleagues on the floor just now when we were voting. It seems the votes to get beyond cloture, the 60-vote threshold, will happen, which means you only need 51 for the underlying bill. The real challenge is, if you are a young guy, you sign up for the military and are 18 or 19 years old, you get a promise, that promise is we'll do what we're going to do for the next -- rest of your life. You retire at 42. And start looking for America to honor the promise, and we say, we made a promise but we're going to break that promise by changing the retirement benefit. And for a 42- year-old E-7, enlisted man, he loses about $75,000 in the next 20 years.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That sounds horrible. I want to support our military in any particular way, but that's the same thing we are hearing like when they restructure in Detroit, when, all of the sudden, people lose pensions.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Yeah.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That is always the situation. How do we accommodate them? What would you have done differently? Rather than penalize the military in this instance, what would you have done differently?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: What I would love for us to have a serious conversation about in Congress is the fact that we have over 1200 duplicative programs that cost the taxpayers $200 billion. Here is an opportunity to reduce our spending and deal with our realities and challenges face on, and not put that on the back of our military.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And for the life of me, I can't figure out why that never happens. Senator Tom Coburn has been talking about all the duplicate programs.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And the GAO has a report every year. And everybody just ignores it. I don't know why we pay for it. That's another expense. We pay for a report we ignore.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: We have more Iraqi economic development plans that cost $26 million to American taxpayers.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So why does that keep happening?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: There's a number of bills that suggest how we can deal with it in a pragmatic approach. It never finds it --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But why?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Well, I would say call Senator Reid. Everybody call Senator Reid and ask why he won't he let these votes on the floor?</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You blame him?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: I blame the process. I certainly blame the leadership of the Senate today because, at the end of the day, we are not tackling the tough issues. One of the challenges, even in this budget deal, is we allowed ourselves to have two more years of spending, but how are we going to pay for it? The offsets happen over 10 years. Remember back to 2011, when we were going to pay for the increase in the debt ceiling over the next 10 years, well, here we sit 24 months later, looking for a new way to deal with the financial challenges.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are you going to vote for the bill?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: I'm not going to vote for this bill tomorrow. There's just no way for -- I think it is a step forward. It's good that both sides are talking. That's good. We're having real pension reform. That's good. But there's two steps back. There's the ugly and bad. The bad is that we're paying for it over 10 years. The ugly is that we're asking our military to pay for it for us, and not taking care of our responsibilities by cutting spending. We are simply shifting who pays in our current active duty military. That's ugly.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What happens when we get to the debt ceiling issue in February or March?</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Hopefully, we won't have another one-year increase with 10-years to pay for it. Hopefully, we'll do something more logical by looking at the underlying debt, giving ourselves an opportunity to have a source conversation. It's good that Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan are having conversations. If we continue that, perhaps we can find a real solution that actually cut spending enough to have a discussion on the debt ceiling.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, always nice to see you, sir.</p><p/><p>SCOTT: Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Straight ahead, new information about some Obamacare navigators. Should there be a criminal investigation? What are the navigators doing and could it get you in trouble? Congressman Trey Gowdy is here next.</p><p/><p>And you can \"Hash It Out\" with us. We know you have an opinion about this one. Will Obamacare save your family money in the long run or will it crush your finances? Tweet or post on Facebook right now using #great.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: This is a FOX News alert. The hunt is on right now for two killers behind a deadly mall carjacking. At an upscale shopping mall, a young couple out doing holiday shopping is suddenly attacked in a parking lot outside of a Nordstrom store. The husband had opened the car door for his wife and walked around to the driver's door when it happened.</p><p/><p>WNYW FOX New York's Sharon Crowley joins us from the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.</p><p/><p>Tell me what is the latest?</p><p/><p>SHARON CROWLEY, CORRESPONDENT, WNYW FOX NEW YORK: Yeah, what a sad story just before Christmas as well.</p><p/><p>What you reported is true. It was just as the mall was closing. He and his wife were returning to their SUV and getting in the car. 30-year-old Dustin Friedlander, of Hoboken, New Jersey. He and his wife both attorneys. Just finished shopping. She is sitting in the passenger side and he's just about to get in the driver's side door when he's ambushed by two, police say, thugs who were trying to carjack his expensive SUV. They shot him in the head, police say, and sped off in his car. His wife was screaming. The mall, the Short Hills Mall, a very affluent, expensive, luxurious mall, was put in a lookdown for a short time. He was transported to the hospital but died a short time later.</p><p/><p>Tonight, Greta, police have not found the gunmen. They are looking for two suspects who sped off in the stolen car and another vehicle that they were seen in, a green Subaru. There's an extensive reward being offered for their arrest.</p><p/><p>Earlier, we had breaking developments on this story. The stolen SUV was found in Newark, Newark, New Jersey, in a high-crime area next to an abandoned home which sources tell us is well-known for car thieves. They often drop the stolen cars there in that area.</p><p/><p>So one of the possibilities tonight they are looking at is whether they are connected to a larger car theft ring. Right now, no arrests have been made.</p><p/><p>The Short Hills Mall has been reopened. We talked with shoppers today. Greta, people are on edge. Security here is very, very tight. And there is a visible police presence. There always is. But the mall is reviewing its security procedures and has added police officers.</p><p/><p>And another important development, they will be looking at any security cameras in the mall-level parking lot or stores around there to see if that will assist them, Greta, in solving this crime.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Sharon, for the life of me, I can't understand why they haven't released that videotape already. This is a manhunt for two killers. They could kill again. They've shown they are capable of killing. This happened Saturday night and the videotape -- the place has to be loaded with security cameras in the parking lot. Why aren't the videotapes released already so we can put them out there for people to help?</p><p/><p>CROWLEY: Absolutely right. Greta, that it is something that -- the Essex County prosecutor's office is the lead investigator on this case. We've been in touch with them. That is certainly something you would think that would help in this case, especially the high-end retail stores, Nordstrom and Sak's Fifth Avenue. These stores you know are loaded with security cameras inside and outside of the building and in the parking lot. Certainly that would be helpful if we were able to see that. Unless, of course, police are closing in on exactly who they are looking for.</p><p/><p>One of the things that investigators said in this case is that usually the carjackers, although carjacking is violent, they steal the car. They don't shoot and kill the driver as well. That is unusual. And in this area, Short Hills, Milburn, New Jersey, it is a very affluent, very low-crime area. So this is a highly unusual event in this area.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I might add, when you carjack a car, unless you have gloves on, you would leave a lot clues and fibers, if you sneeze, anything, DNA all over the inside of the car, so that car could be a wealth of information to try to track down these two killers.</p><p/><p>We'll stay on this story and Sharon will as well.</p><p/><p>Thank you, Sharon.</p><p/><p>CROWLEY: OK, thank you.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Obamacare navigators telling you to break the law. What are they doing and why are they doing it? Congressman Trey Gowdy is here, coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are Obamacare navigators breaking the law? A new report shows many of them are telling you to commit fraud. The report claims some Obamacare navigators telling people to lie on their health care applications in order to get better credits and subsidies. Guess what? That is a fraud. That's illegal. You can go to jail for that stuff.</p><p/><p>Congressman Trey Gowdy joins us.</p><p/><p>Good evening, sir.</p><p/><p>REP. TREY GOWDY, (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Good evening. How are you?</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Very well.</p><p/><p>Am I right this is one of the suspicions that navigators are telling people how to commit a crime?</p><p/><p>GOWDY: It is more than a suspicion. There are at least two tapes that I'm aware of. One was lie about your finances and the other was lie about your preexisting habit of smoking, both of which would impact your premium you're your subsidy.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And I am looking at the U.S. House of Representatives report. I have a copy right here. And I will read the part you were just talking about. It says, \"Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance applications so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recording advising applicants to lie about smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium.\"</p><p/><p>Has this been referred to the Department of Justice of to the local U.S. attorney?</p><p/><p>GOWDY: I doubt it. Nothing much seems to get referred these days for criminal prosecution. I don't even know whether they've lost their job, Greta. I know the young lady who made the mistakes of answering Sean Hannity's questions on the phone lost her job. I don't even know if these two have lost their job. But there is no background check and it's 20 hours of training. You undergo more training to be a life guard at a reflection poll than you do to be a navigator. And you can take the test as many times as you need to. Think of how well you would have done in school if you could keep taking the test until you pass it.</p><p/><p>The navigator thing -- it is a shame you have to have a navigator to access a federal program to begin with. Then, no background check and 20 hours of training and taking the test as many times as you want, and then you can council people to commit frauds once you want to enroll.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: It's basic law, for those who are unaware. If you participate and aid and abet someone in committing a crime, you are just as guilty as a principle. Every time you do it, it's another count. If you do it with five people as a navigator, those are five felony counts right there. Right?</p><p/><p>GOWDY: Well, we can't even get the GAO -- yeah, you are right. It's aiding and abetting. And if you know about it, and don't report it, it's a felony. But we can't get anybody prosecuted by this Department of Justice. So hold out no hope. I will just settle if they don't get to keep their jobs and counsel more people.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But why -- why did you have to go all the way to Justice. Why can't you have the U.S. attorney in Dallas or the first assistant to call them up and say convene a grand jury? You don't have to get permission from Eric Holder. If you start an investigation and Eric Holder suddenly stepped on it, from D.C. to Dallas, that would raise holy hell within the ranks of the U.S. attorneys.</p><p/><p>GOWDY: It has happen before. But you are right. The U.S. attorney and the district in Texas that happens to be could do that. And for all I know, they may be working on it. I think it is a shame, if you have on tape somebody counseling someone else to commit a fraud against the taxpayers, and there is no sanction or consequence. It would be a nice start if you just lost your job before you got referred for criminal prosecutions.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: We should make note, when you talk about the subsidies, if you're trying to -- if they are lying about his or her income so they get a subsidy, that means taxpayers pay extra money out of their pocket to some insurance company. Taxpayers, they are the ones that suffer financially.</p><p/><p>GOWDY: You have the whole concept of unjust enrichment. But, Greta, for whatever reason, people seem to treat government money differently than they do their own, and it is OK to lie to get a higher subsidy or I -- Yeah, we have a lot of issues in this country, morality being one of them. I just can't believe that someone -- the taxpayers are paying the salary for a navigator that's counseling someone to defraud taxpayers out of money. I would love to leave Congress and prosecute the case myself, and the one you referenced in the last segment as well</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you about the contracts and the subpoena. I have a copy of a letter that was sent to Chairman Darrell Issa, and the letter is from Alfred Grasso and it's the MITRE Corporation. He's trying to explain why it is that he doesn't want to comply directly with the subpoena from the House Oversight Committee. He is one of the contractors. What is his excuse for not complying with a subpoena?</p><p/><p>GOWDY: There is a contract that forbids him from making disclosures to third partnerships. But I've got news for Kathleen Sebelius, Congress is not a third party. And my guess is that gentlemen, if he hasn't sought legal counsel and concluded he needs to comply with this subpoena very shortly, will. Two contractors reached the right conclusion. Which if between Kathleen Sebelius and Darrell Issa, you are better off doing what Darrell Issa tells you to do.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Will Congress and Chairman Issa put their foot down and get these documents? There's always such a long dance in getting them. If it is a subpoena, they should provide them no questions asked.</p><p/><p>GOWDY: Yes, then we'll fight over the redactions. Lots of the documents are redacted. And then, Greta, you don't know what you don't know. So if the contractor gives information but it's not a total disclosure, we don't know what we don't have. Underlying your question is also, why does nothing ever happen to people who don't do what Congress tells them to do? That's a recurring conversation that you and I have. The fact that Kathleen Sebelius, if -- if told someone not to conform to a subpoena, even if they do, I would encourage Chairman Issa to still investigate it. To me, it is not alls well that ends well. If you counsel someone to impede a congressional investigation, even if they don't take your advice, I would love to see them investigated. And my suspicion is that my advice would be well received by Chairman Issa.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: The irony is they all work for us. The contractors are getting paid with our money as taxpayers. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of HHS, works for us. We are the only ones who don't get the information. Everyone is taking our money and having secret contracts that we can't even see and we don't even know how they're spending our money. We don't even know what is in the contracts.</p><p/><p>GOWDY: Not only are they taking your money but they're taking your personal information. This is what all of this is about, is whether or not your information is secure. And I have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to convene a special College of Cardinals to keep Darrell Issa from getting information so he can know whether or not your data is secure or not.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOWDY: It's not just your money, it's also -- yes, ma'am.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: It is also your personal stuff.</p><p/><p>Congressman, thank you very much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. But thank you, sir.</p><p/><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. And have a good night.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, too,</p><p/><p>Coming up, he has the big and flashy ads and the big celebrities in his back pocket. But are young Americans now turning on President Obama, and why? That's next?</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(SINGING)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.</p><p/><p>A big setback today for President Obama and NSA. Today, a federal judge ruling the NSA's domestic phone spying program unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for future appeals and court challenges. And tomorrow, President Obama meets with the heads of all the big tech companies to talk about moving forward from the spying scandal.</p><p/><p>And it's not over -- a new dangerous winter storm sweeping across America from the Midwest to the northeast. Many people are getting a second battering of wild winter weather. And tonight many places hit with even more snow. This latest flash is paralyzing much of the Midwest tonight. And are you ready to play \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\" Well, you better grab a Mega Millions ticket -- the jackpot climbing all the way up to $586 million. That big drawing? That's tomorrow. And if nobody wins before Christmas, it could be a very merry holiday for someone because the jackpot could climb to $1 billion. And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\" And the flashy ads of big-name celebrities in a gigantic social media push. HHS is pulling out all the stops to get millennials -- yes, those are the young people -- to sign up for Obamacare. But do millennials want Obamacare or do they even -- do they even want President Obama in office anymore? A poll just out showing a majority of millennials disapprove of the president's performance. Forty-six percent disapprove of President Obama's job performance, while just 45 percent approve. And now, our panel going \"On the Record\" -- A.B. Stoddard from the Hill, John McCormack from the \"Weekly Standard\" and Susan Ferrechio from the \"Washington Examiner.\" A.B., first to you -- your description of the Obamacare rollout is a turn off to the millennials, so how does Obama administration undo that turn off?</p><p/><p>A.B. STODDARD, \"THE HILL\": Well it's going to take a lot of work. I mean, I think that this is a generation of kids who are well informed, that are internet savvy, they also are struggling to find an anchor in the middle class and get their first few jobs and establish themselves with some kind of financial security. They know, if they've read about this, that it's off to a rocky start if you -- just because you get into the web -- to the website -- doesn't mean you actually end up purchasing insurance. And they might've also found out that the non-compliance fee in the first year is only $95 and it's very difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to collect. So, all of the signals from the administration to these people are we can't handle what we promised. They have to do the reverse, they have to start talking about the benefits of getting insurance -- the ease of getting insurance. Otherwise, I think these people are going to say 'Sounds like there's a lot of waivers and extensions and problems, maybe we'll just sit it out and see what they come up -- it must be changing sometime soon.'</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: John, so now we're going to have this sort of P.R. campaign where they're going to try and tell everybody this is great, all the millennials says it's fantastic.</p><p/><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, \"WEEKLY STAR\": That's what they're going for, but I don't think any marketing campaign can really save them from this law. A there's one study out that said that 80 percent of people under the age of 30 are going to pay more for health insurance under Obamacare, even with the subsidies. So, unless you make less than 200 percent of the poverty level, you're definitely going to be worse off. So the real problem isn't marketing, it's just simple economics. I mean, you have to look at the fact that there are millions of people out there who didn't have health insurance because they thought it was a bad deal before Obamacare. They made it cost more, and why would they sign up for it now?</p><p/><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I agree with that and I also think if you look, there's another poll that says most young people feel like the law is not going to be around for much longer -- that it's going to end up being repealed or it's going to collapse. Why sign up for something that's not going to be there for them? I mean, they're willing to wait in line overnight for an iPhone which they're going to get and hold in their hand and have something for it, but for students -- people with student loans, their parents don't have as much money to help them out, you know, they're struggling to pay their rent, to pay their $100 a month cell phone bill. I looked at some of the costs for young people all around the country -- you're looking at costs 2, $300 a month for big deductibles, $5,000 for a plan that only covers 60% and you know I just -- for young people, it's not going to add up. I think it's going to be really tough to get them enrolled.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So, what happens if they don't? Everybody's got such a grim view that nothing -- that you know they're not going to sign up, so with them not going to sign up, who's going to pay for this, A.B.?</p><p/><p>STODDARD: Well, that's going to be a problem that's worked out in 2014. The prices for 2014 have been set, the insurance companies are going to look after March 31 at just how many people were enrolled. The administration said to sustain the program, they're looking at a risk balance of three to one -- one young healthy person to every three sick, risky elder people. If that doesn't work out, and that equation is out of whack, we're going to see prices rise in 2015 and that's how it's going to get paid for.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Spike or ride? Spike or ride?</p><p/><p>STODDARD: Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if we're going to be doing a taxpayer bailout of the insurance companies combined with higher prices or all higher premiums. I don't know how it's going to break up.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What's the best news for Obama administration on Obamacare?</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: The best news -- I'm stumped. Honestly --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know, Susan, if there's any good news coming out of this?</p><p/><p>FERRECHIO: Well, I would think that if they can find a way to help the insurance companies through these risk corridors where there's some money that the administration can use where they don't have to go through Congress, that might be able to sustain it for another year. And if they have you know see that Hollywood on their side trying to promote this thing, they may be able to get more people enrolled. I mean, they do have you know Hollywood backing them with the big promotional campaign -- it's possible.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But I don't even see a lot of sympathy from the insurance companies. The insurance companies are trying to knock the -- you know, like Mayo Clinic and M.D. Anderson -- they're trying to keep them out of the mix because they're expensive place to get medical care. I mean, the insurance companies are not making them particularly sympathetic like you want to help them.</p><p/><p>STODDARD: I think that's easy for the administration to dump on the insurance company -- companies -- when things go bad. Just like when President Obama had to admit the people who were self-insured and were promised they were going to get to keep their policy they elected, actually had just lost it and couldn't have it -- the law was never going to let them. It's easy to knock the insurance companies and say, 'Well, we had to make those -- we had to outlaw those plans because they were so terrible.'</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yes, but isn't the president aligned with them -- I mean --</p><p/><p>STODDARD: Oh, my God --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- isn't the president joined at the hip with the insurance companies? How can he blame the insurance companies:?</p><p/><p>STODDARD: The insurance companies -- the insurance industry cannot collapse. They insure us. If it's not made right for them the whole thing collapses on itself -- this death spiral of price increases that everyone talks about as a worst-case scenario. We can't just blame the insurance companies. They've now taken in the sick. This has to work. And so the best news for the Obama administration in some states -- some of the -- you know, the percentage targets are being reached for enrollment -- those are largely in states that are running their own exchanges, not the ones that are under healthcare.gov. If they can somehow fit -- align -- the enrollment with the purchasing and make sure that more people are insured, and convince young people, they might meet their target numbers.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right, panel if you'll stand by, because we'll be back with you a little bit later. Straight ahead, did President Obama deliberately delay important regulations to keep his job? New evidence tonight points right to the Whitehouse. That's coming up next. Also, these men and women hitting the streets in Santa costumes. But then something went terribly wrong. More of this wild video up next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now it's time to show you what we are watching. We've put together the most fantastic videos out there tonight. Take a look -- naughty or nice? Apparently not all Santas play by the same rules. This group getting very naughty, drawing punches and pushing each other to the ground, all of it caught on camera. Hundreds of people dressed as Santa hit the streets of New York City each year for SantaCon. It's mostly a pub crawl, but clearly this group of Santas hit the bottle a bit too hard. Talk about holiday spirit. And winter sports aren't just for humans. Check out this bird who apparently forgot he or she can fly. The bird turning a jar lid into a sled. Watch as this creature hops on board and slides right down the roof. Now that looks fun, but next time it'd probably be a lot easier just to use his wings. And this is the strangest yet coolest Christmas card our \"On the Record\" staff has seen in years. Meet the (Holderness) family.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>(SINGING CLIP)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now, the \"On the Record\" staff wants me to make one of these, but I think I'll wait until the staff does its first. And that's what we are watching tonight. And coming up, new evidence that President Obama may have deliberately dragged his feet about something important to you just to get reelected. What was it? And is he any different from other presidents? Your \"On the Record\" political panel is back next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: President Obama delay important environmental regulations to keep his own job? Well there's new evidence he pushed back some EPA changes until after the 2012 election, but do all presidents do this essentially -- just play us? Our \"On the Record\" panel is back. And first (inaudible) is a \"Washington Post\" article suggested that the Obama administration has egregiously been playing the delay game to get reelected. What's the problem?</p><p/><p>FERRECHIO: I think the important quote in that story was the word went out from the Whitehouse according to one administration official that they were not anxious to have these regulations under review because of the upcoming election. I mean, it says it all right there -- that they were really concerned about their reelection prospect. And it goes beyond just the environmental regulations. I think there's a lot of suspicion that the healthcare law was -- you know -- things were promised when maybe people realized those promises would not be kept because they wanted to preserve the president's -- you know -- how he could sell himself to voters. I mean, there was worried about him -- them -- changing, you know, the nuisances of how he explained the health care law because they were worried about reelection. And what it does is it cost him the trust of the public, and then as a consequence, Democrats overall are not trusted. And they're the ones who are going to be in the hot seat in 2014. This is a campaign now that rights itself. It's like -- do you trust these Democrats to be your senator or your representative.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Is President Obama any worse, John, than other administrations that's put -- part one of my question -- the second part is pushing us off these regulations until after the election. I mean, Congress does it overtly. They put all deadlines after the election. I mean, the Obama administration's just doing something toward sneaky, under the table that Congress does overtly.</p><p/><p>MCCORMACK: Well, I think putting controversial policy decisions until after an election is politics as usual. But, again, from a president who said he wasn't going to give us politics as usual. I mean, if you look at George W. Bush, who was more policy issues. You know, he tackled social security reform which went down in flames after the election. I think a lot of people don't think it was a coincidence that some even campaigns in Iraq -- the of Second Battle of Fallujah happened right after the election and not right before, I think people obviously -- if you lose the election, you lose the agenda. So when you're the president, you can sort of say to yourself, well, maybe I'm not doing this for a purely political reason, but I'm doing it in the long-run for the policy gains.</p><p/><p>But I think right here what's interesting is that you actually have the \"Post\" saying this is much worse. The \"Washington Post\" reported that it was worse than its predecessors. And I think it's actually coming back to haunt him with the healthcare. You know, there's been a lot of complaints from the contractors who've been kind of quiet, you know, they don't want to get beaten up too bad, but when they have responded, why did things go wrong? They said well a lot of these regulations went out late, you know. There have been with the website in terms of how they structured it whether you can browse it -- well these decisions weren't made until after the election. So I think really a lot of the problems with the healthcare website -- we might find this out in the long -- after we do more investigating -- that this is because of these political decisions which have really come back to bite the president.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: A.B., does he have any stock -- any credibility stock -- because he's, you know -- the healthcare is a nightmare and he doesn't have a lot of friends on Capitol Hill. What does he have going for him?</p><p/><p>STODDARD: Well, he has three more years. And that's really about it at this point. He has an economy I would mention that you know is going in the right direction and if it were to make considerable gains in the next 18 months or so, I think -- I believe -- that could turn things around. For him, ultimately --</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Except, except for (inaudible) there's one problem though and that's that he's got to get -- if he loses the Senate, he's got nothing.</p><p/><p>STODDARD: Oh, no, and that's possible. Like I said, I don't know that the economy will make gains to convince the public that he did the right think until after the midterm elections anyway. I think between now and the next year, we're going to look at a closer scrutiny of his regulations process - - what is he going to do before -- what will he release in 2014 before the midterms or will he release afterwards? He's going to have a night and day oversight of the Affordable Care Act. He is really in a bind right now because there's no path out -- there's nothing else to talk about. They can keep talking about immigration reform, but it's not something Republicans are interested in as a party. Maybe sometime late summer but maybe not. And so for President Obama, the only thing he can do is work night and day to restore his credibility on healthcare. I really think his entire presidency is tied to whether that turns around or fails.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Panel, thank you very much. And let's all go \"Off the Record\" for just a minute. On Thursday, I flew to Iraq with Reverend Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse and went to a Syrian refugee camp in Iraq. I did it for two important reasons -- first of all, I want to do a good job for you. I want you to know what's going on in the world -- that's my job -- and I do a better job for you when I see something firsthand -- not just from reading about it on an internet or off a computer screen. Second, I go because I care, and I know you care too. Yes, things aren't perfect here at home and we do needs lots of help here, but Americans have big hearts, and we try to do as much as we can for everyone. And that does include refugees -- people fleeing for their lives from their governments, they're so desperate, so cold and hungry and in great despair. It's a pretty grim scene. Now, Reverend Graham and I walked the refugee camp, seeing people -- children, adults -- shivering from this frigid Iraqi winter weather. We met a 90-year-old woman draped in blankets, desperately trying to get warm. There are a few heaters, but thousands and thousands of refugees are there, and winter has set in with a vengeance. So upon seeing this misery, Reverend Graham told his team to buy 2,000 heaters and get them there immediately. That's big. And he could do that because so many of you have generously donated to Samaritan's Purse. Your contributions take a big difference in people's lives. And of course Americans can't help everybody in every place, but we all try to do what we can and that's how I spent my weekend. And you'll see more of this journey to the Iraqi refugee camp in an upcoming special edition of \"Fox Files\" that's coming soon on TV. And of course I've already posted photographs on gretawire, so go see them. That's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight. But if you have an important story or issue you think I should take \"Off the Record,\" go to gretawire.com and tell us about it. And coming up, nearly two months Nick Diez went \"On the Record\" to tell you about is canceled healthcare plan. So, has he had any luck finding a new plan? Nick is back to tell you next, and don't forget tonight, 10:00 p.m., \"Hannity.\" Sean's investigating into new Obamacare navigators who are accused of telling Americans to commit fraud. That's tonight, an all-new \"Hannity\" at 10:00 p.m. eastern.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Our next guest went \"On the Record\" in October just after Obamacare's rollout. His insurance company had canceled his plan, so nearly two months later, has he had any luck finding a new plan? Nick Diez joins us. Good evening.</p><p/><p>NICK DIEZ, INSURANCE PLAN CANCELED DUE TO OBAMACARE: Hi, Greta.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So, Nick, I know that your wife had breast cancer and so you had particular challenges in trying to find the right policy for your family. So, tell me, have you found that?</p><p/><p>DIEZ: We have not.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Well, you're coming up on December 23rd, I guess you know you have a few more days beyond that, but so, what's been the problem?</p><p/><p>DIEZ: Well, there's been a number of problems, Greta. As you know, we tried to every way possible to try to find some coverage and every time we went in one direction, we got turned around and had to start trying again. Come to find out the other day that the insurance companies that are offering ACA plans in South Carolina are not offering the doctors and hospitals that we've been accustomed to using so now we're in a quandary. We don't know what to do, and to make matters worse, I found out from an insurance agent today that I was trying to work with that since we didn't get our application in by this past weekend, that we're definitely going to be without coverage January 1st, so we're going to go at least one month without any insurance coverage.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know, Nick, I find it absolutely cruel that your family has had to deal with cancer, and I know from just studying for the segment tonight, that your wife can't have the oncologist that she's been dealing with. You know, this whole idea that you could keep your doctor if you like it -- I mean, here we have life-threatening illnesses and we have a good relationship and a doctor who has kept your wife alive and treated her cancer, and now suddenly your lives are turned upside down. To me, it's appalling.</p><p/><p>DIEZ: Yes, it's a terrible situation. You know, strike one, we found out that we could not keep our plan, strike two, we now find that we can't keep our doctors. I guess strike three is January 1 when we're going to lose coverage all together. It's just a terrible situation for somebody like me -- an average guy -- that is, you know, has been accustomed to doing what's right and kept our family covered for all these 35 years we've been married, and now we're at a loss for what to do.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now, there are two companies in South Carolina that provide insurance -- is that correct?</p><p/><p>DIEZ: That is correct.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why isn't your oncologist on it? Is your oncologist not allowed onto the networks? Is there a problem -- or your wife's oncologist, I should say.</p><p/><p>DIEZ: I don't know the answer to that. The oncologist is part of a large medical university here in South Carolina, and that's why we go to them, and as I understand it from talking with their finance department today, the entire medical university is not going to be part of the plans.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And that would be a decision of the insurance company or the medical -- or the medical center?</p><p/><p>DIEZ: I don't know the answer to that.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right, I suspect that it -- I mean, maybe they've made it untenable, but you know -- I know that doctors want to be part of successful plans so that they can help people and take care of the patients, and I know it's become very difficult. Nick, you know, I only -- I hope that things turn around for you on this. It doesn't look very likely in the short-run, but I do wish you and your family the best of luck. Thank you for joining us to tonight and keep us informed --</p><p/><p>DIEZ: Thank you.</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- will you?</p><p/><p>DIEZ: (Inaudible).</p><p/><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And thank you for joining us -- and thank you for being with us tonight. We're going to see you again tomorrow night right here at 7 p.m. eastern. Don't forget these three letters -- D-V-R. If you're getting home and turning on before Bill O'Reilly, pick up your DVR remote, get a -- set series recording. Good night from Washington.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

And do you believe Press Secretary Jay Carney  really believes this?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Today, we are focusing on the  savings that millions of consumers have already seen because of the health  care law's provisions that produces more value for their health insurance  premium dollars.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VAN SUSTEREN:  Most Americans don't agree with Jay Carney.  You've heard  many horror stories right here ON THE RECORD.  And a new Associated Press  poll shows 69 percent of the Americans say their premiums are going up.   And 59 percent say their health plan and their co-payment or deductible is  increasing.  </p><p>Joining us is South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.</p><p>Nice to see you, sir.</p><p>SEN. TIM SCOTT, (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Thank you, Greta.  It's good to be  back with you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  So Jay Carney says thinks millions of Americans are seeing  savings?  </p><p>SCOTT:  It is remarkable.  There's no way in the world you can add tens of  thousands of government employees, have a $400 million website and see  premiums go down and not up.  If you the look at the facts, the facts are  simple.  People in South Carolina -- Mr. Hucks from Greenville, South  Carolina, sent me a letter.  Talked to him for a little while.  His  premiums are going up by 75 percent.  His deductible is going from $10,000  to $25,000.  But his premiums are going from $450 to over $800 a month.  If  he wanted to go to a co-pay plan, lower deductable, $1500 a month for a  family of four, he, his wife and two kids.  </p><p>Premiums are skyrocketing.  But the unfortunate part is premiums are about  price.  Deductibles and co-pay ands out-of-pocket expenses, those are about  the costs.  The costs are also exploding.  And, unfortunately, we'll see  more bad news once the seven million young people do not enroll.  Next  year, year two, the premiums will be based on the actuarial information,  which will be dismal, which means we'll have worse rates and not better  rates.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  For my life though, I can't figure it out.  Jay Carney is a  smart guy.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Why would he put his neck out on this?  And maybe he would  get lucky and the miracle would happen in the next six months and the price  will come crashing down and make everybody flush with cash.  Right now, it  doesn't look like that.  So why is he sticking his neck out and saying  these things, great savings?  </p><p>SCOTT:  I have no idea.  I can tell you this.  If they find a way to  control the price on the front end, it means the cost will rise on the back  end.  You can find a way to get an insurance company to provide an  insurance policy that is not rated sufficient.  It only means that some  how, some way, taxpayers will pick up the tab on the back end.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  That is -- the American taxpayers have always been generous  with the people who are down-and-out.  And as we expand Medicaid, it will  cost more.  </p><p>SCOTT:  Absolutely.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Someone has to pick up the cost some place.  </p><p>SCOTT:  In South Carolina alone, if we were to expand Medicaid, we would  see another $2 billion in costs over the next two years.  There's just no  way -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  What do you do about those people?  I assume that people in  South Carolina want healthy people -- people who are poor with health  issues --</p><p>SCOTT:  Absolutely.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  -- not to be able to get medical care.  What do you do?  </p><p>SCOTT:  I was in Moncks Corner this morning talking about this very topic.   One of the things I suggested we do to lower the cost of health insurance,  not to talk about health care, but lower the cost of health insurance, we  could allow for competition across the state lines and for small business  owners to pool their employees together with other small business owners to  reduce the rate by about 25 percent.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Why didn't we do that?  </p><p>SCOTT:  That is one of the failures of the pre-Obamacare world.  We had an  opportunity to addressed things from a free-market perspective, including  medical tort reform, and we didn't do it.  Now, we're faced with a  challenged of trying to reintroduce common sense into the marketplace.  And  it would work.  We could also fund health care, insurance pools in states  to provide those with preexisting conditions with more opportunities.  The  challenges get worse.  If you are in a group plan, preexisting conditions  are easily absorbed into a large group plan.  When in an individual market,  there is no group so you have to pay exceedingly higher rates to find your  insurance.  That is the challenged.  That, coupled with out-of-pocket  expenses, going from $6,000 or so to as high as 12,000, only means those  folks who can't afford insurance, they get the free health care check up  but they can't take care of the challenges that they find within that check  up, what do we do next?  What do they do next?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  There is a heartbreaker.  But let me ask you about something  else.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I want to talk to you about the bipartisan budget bill?  The  Senate has to vote on it this week.  I think tomorrow.  And under the bill,  military retirement benefits will be cut by $6 billion over the next 10  years.  Is it going to pass the Senate? </p><p>SCOTT:  I think it will probably pass the Senate, watching and listening to  my colleagues on the floor just now when we were voting.  It seems the  votes to get beyond cloture, the 60-vote threshold, will happen, which  means you only need 51 for the underlying bill.  The real challenge is, if  you are a young guy, you sign up for the military and are 18 or 19 years  old, you get a promise, that promise is we'll do what we're going to do for  the next -- rest of your life.  You retire at 42.  And start looking for  America to honor the promise, and we say, we made a promise but we're going  to break that promise by changing the retirement benefit.  And for a 42- year-old E-7, enlisted man, he loses about $75,000 in the next 20 years.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  That sounds horrible.  I want to support our military in any  particular way, but that's the same thing we are hearing like when they  restructure in Detroit, when, all of the sudden, people lose pensions.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yeah.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  That is always the situation.  How do we accommodate them?   What would you have done differently?  Rather than penalize the military in  this instance, what would you have done differently?  </p><p>SCOTT:  What I would love for us to have a serious conversation about in  Congress is the fact that we have over 1200 duplicative programs that cost  the taxpayers $200 billion.  Here is an opportunity to reduce our spending  and deal with our realities and challenges face on, and not put that on the  back of our military.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And for the life of me, I can't figure out why that never  happens.  Senator Tom Coburn has been talking about all the duplicate  programs.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And the GAO has a report every year.  And everybody just  ignores it.  I don't know why we pay for it.  That's another expense.  We  pay for a report we ignore.</p><p>SCOTT:  We have more Iraqi economic development plans that cost $26 million  to American taxpayers.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  So why does that keep happening?  </p><p>SCOTT:  There's a number of bills that suggest how we can deal with it in a  pragmatic approach.  It never finds it -- </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  But why?  </p><p>SCOTT:  Well, I would say call Senator Reid.  Everybody call Senator Reid  and ask why he won't he let these votes on the floor?  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  You blame him?  </p><p>SCOTT:  I blame the process.  I certainly blame the leadership of the  Senate today because, at the end of the day, we are not tackling the tough  issues.  One of the challenges, even in this budget deal, is we allowed  ourselves to have two more years of spending, but how are we going to pay  for it?  The offsets happen over 10 years.  Remember back to 2011, when we  were going to pay for the increase in the debt ceiling over the next 10  years, well, here we sit 24 months later, looking for a new way to deal  with the financial challenges.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Are you going to vote for the bill?  </p><p>SCOTT:  I'm not going to vote for this bill tomorrow.  There's just no way  for -- I think it is a step forward.  It's good that both sides are  talking.  That's good.  We're having real pension reform.  That's good.   But there's two steps back.  There's the ugly and bad.  The bad is that  we're paying for it over 10 years.  The ugly is that we're asking our  military to pay for it for us, and not taking care of our responsibilities  by cutting spending.  We are simply shifting who pays in our current active  duty military.  That's ugly.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  What happens when we get to the debt ceiling issue in  February or March?  </p><p>SCOTT:  Hopefully, we won't have another one-year increase with 10-years to  pay for it.  Hopefully, we'll do something more logical by looking at the  underlying debt, giving ourselves an opportunity to have a source  conversation.  It's good that Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan are  having conversations.  If we continue that, perhaps we can find a real  solution that actually cut spending enough to have a discussion on the debt  ceiling.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Senator, always nice to see you, sir.  </p><p>SCOTT:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Straight ahead, new information about some Obamacare  navigators.  Should there be a criminal investigation?  What are the  navigators doing and could it get you in trouble?  Congressman Trey Gowdy  is here next.  </p><p>And you can \"Hash It Out\" with us.  We know you have an opinion about this  one.  Will Obamacare save your family money in the long run or will it  crush your finances?  Tweet or post on Facebook right now using #great.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  This is a FOX News alert.  The hunt is on right now for two  killers behind a deadly mall carjacking.  At an upscale shopping mall, a  young couple out doing holiday shopping is suddenly attacked in a parking  lot outside of a Nordstrom store.  The husband had opened the car door for  his wife and walked around to the driver's door when it happened.  </p><p>WNYW FOX New York's Sharon Crowley joins us from the Short Hills Mall in  New Jersey.  </p><p>Tell me what is the latest?  </p><p>SHARON CROWLEY, CORRESPONDENT, WNYW FOX NEW YORK:  Yeah, what a sad story  just before Christmas as well.  </p><p>What you reported is true.  It was just as the mall was closing.  He and  his wife were returning to their SUV and getting in the car.  30-year-old  Dustin Friedlander, of Hoboken, New Jersey.  He and his wife both  attorneys.  Just finished shopping.  She is sitting in the passenger side  and he's just about to get in the driver's side door when he's ambushed by  two, police say, thugs who were trying to carjack his expensive SUV.  They  shot him in the head, police say, and sped off in his car.  His wife was  screaming.  The mall, the Short Hills Mall, a very affluent, expensive,  luxurious mall, was put in a lookdown for a short time.  He was transported  to the hospital but died a short time later.  </p><p>Tonight, Greta, police have not found the gunmen.  They are looking for two  suspects who sped off in the stolen car and another vehicle that they were  seen in, a green Subaru.  There's an extensive reward being offered for  their arrest.  </p><p>Earlier, we had breaking developments on this story.  The stolen SUV was  found in Newark, Newark, New Jersey, in a high-crime area next to an  abandoned home which sources tell us is well-known for car thieves.  They  often drop the stolen cars there in that area.  </p><p>So one of the possibilities tonight they are looking at is whether they are  connected to a larger car theft ring.  Right now, no arrests have been  made.  </p><p>The Short Hills Mall has been reopened.  We talked with shoppers today.   Greta, people are on edge.  Security here is very, very tight.  And there  is a visible police presence.  There always is.  But the mall is reviewing  its security procedures and has added police officers.  </p><p>And another important development, they will be looking at any security  cameras in the mall-level parking lot or stores around there to see if that  will assist them, Greta, in solving this crime.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Sharon, for the life of me, I can't understand why they  haven't released that videotape already.  This is a manhunt for two  killers.  They could kill again.  They've shown they are capable of  killing.  This happened Saturday night and the videotape -- the place has  to be loaded with security cameras in the parking lot.  Why aren't the  videotapes released already so we can put them out there for people to  help?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Absolutely right.  Greta, that it is something that -- the Essex  County prosecutor's office is the lead investigator on this case.  We've  been in touch with them.  That is certainly something you would think that  would help in this case, especially the high-end retail stores, Nordstrom  and Sak's Fifth Avenue.  These stores you know are loaded with security  cameras inside and outside of the building and in the parking lot.   Certainly that would be helpful if we were able to see that.  Unless, of  course, police are closing in on exactly who they are looking for.  </p><p>One of the things that investigators said in this case is that usually the  carjackers, although carjacking is violent, they steal the car.  They don't  shoot and kill the driver as well.  That is unusual.  And in this area,  Short Hills, Milburn, New Jersey, it is a very affluent, very low-crime  area.  So this is a highly unusual event in this area.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  I might add, when you carjack a car, unless you have gloves  on, you would leave a lot clues and fibers, if you sneeze, anything, DNA  all over the inside of the car, so that car could be a wealth of  information to try to track down these two killers.</p><p>We'll stay on this story and Sharon will as well.  </p><p>Thank you, Sharon.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  OK, thank you.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Obamacare navigators telling you to break the law.  What are  they doing and why are they doing it?  Congressman Trey Gowdy is here,  coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Are Obamacare navigators breaking the law?  A new report  shows many of them are telling you to commit fraud.  The report claims some  Obamacare navigators telling people to lie on their health care  applications in order to get better credits and subsidies.  Guess what?   That is a fraud.  That's illegal.  You can go to jail for that stuff.</p><p>Congressman Trey Gowdy joins us.  </p><p>Good evening, sir.</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY, (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Good evening.  How are you?  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Very well.  </p><p>Am I right this is one of the suspicions that navigators are telling people  how to commit a crime?  </p><p>GOWDY:  It is more than a suspicion.  There are at least two tapes that I'm  aware of.  One was lie about your finances and the other was lie about your  preexisting habit of smoking, both of which would impact your premium  you're your subsidy.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And I am looking at the U.S. House of Representatives  report.  I have a copy right here.  And I will read the part you were just  talking about.  It says, \"Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were  captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance  applications so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies.  Navigators  were also recording advising applicants to lie about smoking habits to  obtain a lower monthly premium.\"  </p><p>Has this been referred to the Department of Justice of to the local U.S.  attorney?  </p><p>GOWDY:  I doubt it.  Nothing much seems to get referred these days for  criminal prosecution.  I don't even know whether they've lost their job,  Greta.  I know the young lady who made the mistakes of answering Sean  Hannity's questions on the phone lost her job.  I don't even know if these  two have lost their job.  But there is no background check and it's 20  hours of training.  You undergo more training to be a life guard at a  reflection poll than you do to be a navigator.  And you can take the test  as many times as you need to.  Think of how well you would have done in  school if you could keep taking the test until you pass it.  </p><p>The navigator thing -- it is a shame you have to have a navigator to access  a federal program to begin with.  Then, no background check and 20 hours of  training and taking the test as many times as you want, and then you can  council people to commit frauds once you want to enroll.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  It's basic law, for those who are unaware.  If you  participate and aid and abet someone in committing a crime, you are just as  guilty as a principle.  Every time you do it, it's another count.  If you  do it with five people as a navigator, those are five felony counts right  there.  Right? </p><p>GOWDY:  Well, we can't even get the GAO -- yeah, you are right.  It's  aiding and abetting.  And if you know about it, and don't report it, it's a  felony.  But we can't get anybody prosecuted by this Department of Justice.   So hold out no hope.  I will just settle if they don't get to keep their  jobs and counsel more people.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  But why -- why did you have to go all the way to Justice.   Why can't you have the U.S. attorney in Dallas or the first assistant to  call them up and say convene a grand jury?  You don't have to get  permission from Eric Holder.  If you start an investigation and Eric Holder  suddenly stepped on it, from D.C. to Dallas, that would raise holy hell  within the ranks of the U.S. attorneys.  </p><p>GOWDY:  It has happen before.  But you are right.  The U.S. attorney and  the district in Texas that happens to be could do that.  And for all I  know, they may be working on it.  I think it is a shame, if you have on  tape somebody counseling someone else to commit a fraud against the  taxpayers, and there is no sanction or consequence.  It would be a nice  start if you just lost your job before you got referred for criminal  prosecutions.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  We should make note, when you talk about the subsidies, if  you're trying to -- if they are lying about his or her income so they get a  subsidy, that means taxpayers pay extra money out of their pocket to some  insurance company.  Taxpayers, they are the ones that suffer financially.  </p><p>GOWDY:  You have the whole concept of unjust enrichment.  But, Greta, for  whatever reason, people seem to treat government money differently than  they do their own, and it is OK to lie to get a higher subsidy or I --  Yeah, we have a lot of issues in this country, morality being one of them.   I just can't believe that someone -- the taxpayers are paying the salary  for a navigator that's counseling someone to defraud taxpayers out of  money.  I would love to leave Congress and prosecute the case myself, and  the one you referenced in the last segment as well</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Let me ask you about the contracts and the subpoena.  I have  a copy of a letter that was sent to Chairman Darrell Issa, and the letter  is from Alfred Grasso and it's the MITRE Corporation.  He's trying to  explain why it is that he doesn't want to comply directly with the subpoena  from the House Oversight Committee.  He is one of the contractors.  What is  his excuse for not complying with a subpoena?  </p><p>GOWDY:  There is a contract that forbids him from making disclosures to  third partnerships.  But I've got news for Kathleen Sebelius, Congress is  not a third party.  And my guess is that gentlemen, if he hasn't sought  legal counsel and concluded he needs to comply with this subpoena very  shortly, will.  Two contractors reached the right conclusion.  Which if  between Kathleen Sebelius and Darrell Issa, you are better off doing what  Darrell Issa tells you to do.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Will Congress and Chairman Issa put their foot down and get  these documents?  There's always such a long dance in getting them.  If it  is a subpoena, they should provide them no questions asked.  </p><p>GOWDY:  Yes, then we'll fight over the redactions.  Lots of the documents  are redacted.  And then, Greta, you don't know what you don't know.  So if  the contractor gives information but it's not a total disclosure, we don't  know what we don't have.  Underlying your question is also, why does  nothing ever happen to people who don't do what Congress tells them to do?   That's a recurring conversation that you and I have.  The fact that  Kathleen Sebelius, if -- if told someone not to conform to a subpoena, even  if they do, I would encourage Chairman Issa to still investigate it.  To  me, it is not alls well that ends well.  If you counsel someone to impede a  congressional investigation, even if they don't take your advice, I would  love to see them investigated.  And my suspicion is that my advice would be  well received by Chairman Issa.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  The irony is they all work for us.  The contractors are  getting paid with our money as taxpayers.  Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of  HHS, works for us.  We are the only ones who don't get the information.   Everyone is taking our money and having secret contracts that we can't even  see and we don't even know how they're spending our money.  We don't even  know what is in the contracts.  </p><p>GOWDY:  Not only are they taking your money but they're taking your  personal information.  This is what all of this is about, is whether or not  your information is secure.  And I have colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who  want to convene a special College of Cardinals to keep Darrell  Issa from getting information so he can know whether or not your data is  secure or not.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOWDY:  It's not just your money, it's also -- yes, ma'am.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  It is also your personal stuff.  </p><p>Congressman, thank you very much.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt  you.  But thank you, sir. </p><p>GOWDY:  Yes, ma'am.  And have a good night.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Thank you, too,</p><p>Coming up, he has the big and flashy ads and the big celebrities in his  back pocket.  But are young Americans now turning on President Obama, and  why?  That's next?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.  </p><p>A big setback today for President Obama and NSA.  Today, a federal judge  ruling the NSA's domestic phone spying program unconstitutional.  The  ruling paves the way for future appeals and court challenges.  And  tomorrow, President Obama meets with the heads of all the big tech  companies to talk about moving forward from the spying scandal.  </p><p>And it's not over -- a new dangerous winter storm sweeping across America  from the Midwest to the northeast.  Many people are getting a second  battering of wild winter weather.  And tonight many places hit with even  more snow.  This latest flash is paralyzing much of the Midwest tonight.   And are you ready to play \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\"  Well, you  better grab a Mega Millions ticket -- the jackpot climbing all the way up  to $586 million.  That big drawing?  That's tomorrow.  And if nobody wins  before Christmas, it could be a very merry holiday for someone because the  jackpot could climb to $1 billion.  And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\" And the flashy ads of big-name celebrities in a gigantic social media push.   HHS is pulling out all the stops to get millennials -- yes, those are the  young people -- to sign up for Obamacare. But do millennials want Obamacare  or do they even -- do they even want President Obama in office anymore?  A  poll just out showing a majority of millennials disapprove of the  president's performance.  Forty-six percent disapprove of President Obama's    job performance, while just 45 percent approve.   And now, our panel going \"On the Record\" -- A.B. Stoddard from the Hill,  John McCormack from the \"Weekly Standard\" and Susan Ferrechio from the  \"Washington Examiner.\"  A.B., first to you -- your description of the  Obamacare rollout is a turn off to the millennials, so how does Obama  administration undo that turn off?  </p><p>A.B. STODDARD, \"THE HILL\":  Well it's going to take a lot of work.  I mean,  I think that this is a generation of kids who are well informed, that are  internet savvy, they also are struggling to find an anchor in the middle  class and get their first few jobs and establish themselves with some kind  of financial security.  They know, if they've read about this, that it's  off to a rocky start if you -- just because you get into the web -- to the  website -- doesn't mean you actually end up purchasing insurance.  And they  might've also found out that the non-compliance fee in the first year is  only $95 and it's very difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to  collect. So, all of the signals from the administration to these people are we can't  handle what we promised.  They have to do the reverse, they have to start  talking about the benefits of getting insurance -- the ease of getting  insurance.  Otherwise, I think these people are going to say 'Sounds like  there's a lot of waivers and extensions and problems, maybe we'll just sit  it out and see what they come up -- it must be changing sometime soon.'</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  John, so now we're going to have this sort of P.R. campaign  where they're going to try and tell everybody this is great, all the  millennials says it's fantastic.</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, \"WEEKLY STAR\":  That's what they're going for, but I don't  think any marketing campaign can really save them from this law.  A there's  one study out that said that 80 percent of people under the age of 30 are  going to pay more for health insurance under Obamacare, even with the  subsidies.  So, unless you make less than 200 percent of the poverty level,  you're definitely going to be worse off.  So the real problem isn't  marketing, it's just simple economics.  I mean, you have to look at the  fact that there are millions of people out there who didn't have health  insurance because they thought it was a bad deal before Obamacare.  They  made it cost more, and why would they sign up for it now?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  I agree with that and I also  think if you look, there's another poll that says most young people feel  like the law is not going to be around for much longer -- that it's going  to end up being repealed or it's going to collapse.  Why sign  up for  something that's not going to be there for them?  I mean, they're willing  to wait in line overnight for an iPhone which they're going to get and hold  in their hand and have something for it, but for students -- people with  student loans, their parents don't have as much money to help them out, you  know, they're struggling to pay their rent, to pay their $100 a month cell  phone bill.  I looked at some of the costs for young people all around the  country -- you're looking at costs 2, $300 a month for big deductibles,  $5,000 for a plan that only covers 60% and you know I just -- for young  people, it's not going to add up.  I think it's going to be really tough to  get them enrolled.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  So, what happens if they don't?  Everybody's got such a grim  view that nothing -- that you know they're not going to sign up, so with  them not going to sign up, who's going to pay for this, A.B.?</p><p>STODDARD:  Well, that's going to be a problem that's worked out in 2014.   The prices for 2014 have been set, the insurance companies are going to  look after March 31 at just how many people were enrolled.  The  administration said to sustain the program, they're looking at a risk  balance of three to one -- one young healthy person to every three sick,  risky elder people.  If that doesn't work out, and that equation is out of  whack, we're going to see prices rise in 2015 and that's how it's going to  get paid for.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Spike or ride?  Spike or ride?</p><p>STODDARD:  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  I don't know if we're going to be  doing a taxpayer bailout of the insurance companies combined with higher  prices or all higher premiums.  I don't know how it's going to break up.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  What's the best news for Obama administration on Obamacare?  </p><p>MCCORMACK:  The best news -- I'm stumped.  Honestly --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  You know, Susan, if there's any good news coming out of  this?</p><p>FERRECHIO:  Well, I would think that if they can find a way to help the  insurance companies through these risk corridors where there's some money  that the administration can use where they don't have to go through  Congress, that might be able to sustain it for another year.  And if they  have you know see that Hollywood on their side trying to promote this  thing, they may be able to get more people enrolled.  I mean, they do have  you know Hollywood backing them with the big promotional campaign -- it's  possible.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  But I don't even see a lot of sympathy from the insurance  companies.  The insurance companies are trying to knock the -- you know,  like Mayo Clinic and M.D. Anderson -- they're trying to keep them out of  the mix because they're expensive place to get medical care.  I mean, the  insurance companies are not making them particularly sympathetic like you  want to help them. </p><p>STODDARD:  I think that's easy for the administration to dump on the  insurance company -- companies -- when things go bad.  Just like when  President Obama had to admit the people who were self-insured and were  promised they were going to get to keep their policy they elected, actually  had just lost it and couldn't have it -- the law was never going to let  them.  It's easy to knock the insurance companies and say, 'Well, we had to  make those -- we had to outlaw those plans because they were so terrible.'</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Yes, but isn't the president aligned with them -- I mean -- </p><p>STODDARD:  Oh, my God --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  -- isn't the president joined at the hip with the insurance  companies?  How can he blame the insurance companies:?</p><p>STODDARD:  The insurance companies -- the insurance industry cannot  collapse.  They insure us.  If it's not made right for them the whole thing  collapses on itself -- this death spiral of price increases that everyone  talks about as a worst-case scenario.  We can't just blame the insurance  companies.  They've now taken in the sick.  This has to work.  And so the  best news for the Obama administration in some states -- some of the -- you  know, the percentage targets are being reached for enrollment -- those are  largely in states that are running their own exchanges, not the ones that  are under healthcare.gov.  If they can somehow fit -- align -- the  enrollment with the purchasing and make sure that more people are insured,  and convince young people, they might meet their target numbers.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  All right, panel if you'll stand by, because we'll be back  with you a little bit later.  Straight ahead, did President Obama  deliberately delay important regulations to keep his job?  New evidence  tonight points right to the Whitehouse.  That's coming up next.  Also,  these men and women hitting the streets in Santa costumes. But then  something went terribly wrong.  More of this wild video up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Now it's time to show you what we are watching.  We've put  together the most fantastic videos out there tonight.  Take a look --  naughty or nice?  Apparently not all Santas play by the same rules.  This  group getting very naughty, drawing punches and pushing each other to the  ground, all of it caught on camera.  Hundreds of people dressed as Santa  hit the streets of New York City each year for SantaCon.  It's mostly a pub  crawl, but clearly this group of Santas hit the bottle a bit too hard.   Talk about holiday spirit.   And winter sports aren't just for humans.  Check out this bird who  apparently forgot he or she can fly.  The bird turning a jar lid into a  sled.  Watch as this creature hops on board and slides right down the roof.   Now that looks fun, but next time it'd probably be a lot easier just to use  his wings. And this is the strangest yet coolest Christmas card our \"On the Record\"  staff has seen in years.  Meet the (Holderness) family.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(SINGING CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Now, the \"On the Record\" staff wants me to make one of  these, but I think I'll wait until the staff does its first.  And that's  what we are watching tonight. And coming up, new evidence that President Obama may have deliberately  dragged his feet about something important to you just to get reelected.   What was it?  And is he any different from other presidents?  Your \"On the  Record\" political panel is back next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  President Obama delay important environmental regulations to  keep his own job?  Well there's new evidence he pushed back some EPA  changes until after the 2012 election, but do all presidents do this  essentially -- just play us?  Our \"On the Record\" panel is back.  And first  (inaudible) is a \"Washington Post\" article suggested that the Obama  administration has egregiously been playing the delay game to get  reelected.  What's the problem?</p><p>FERRECHIO:  I think the important quote in that story was the word went out  from the Whitehouse according to one administration official that they were  not anxious to have these regulations under review because of the upcoming  election.  I mean, it  says it all right there -- that they were really  concerned about their reelection prospect.  And it goes beyond just the  environmental regulations.  I think there's a lot of suspicion that the  healthcare law was -- you know -- things were promised when maybe people  realized those promises would not be kept because they wanted to preserve  the president's -- you know -- how he could sell himself to voters.  I  mean, there was worried about him -- them -- changing, you know, the  nuisances of how he explained the health care law because they were worried  about reelection. And what it does is it cost him the trust of the public, and then as a  consequence, Democrats overall are not trusted.  And they're the ones who  are going to be in the hot seat in 2014.  This is a campaign now that  rights itself.  It's like -- do you trust these Democrats to be your  senator or your representative.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Is President Obama any worse, John, than other  administrations that's put -- part one of my question -- the second part is  pushing us off these regulations until after the election.  I mean,  Congress does it overtly.  They put all deadlines after the election.  I  mean, the Obama administration's just doing something toward sneaky, under  the table that Congress does overtly.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  Well, I think putting controversial policy decisions until  after an election is politics as usual.  But, again, from a president who  said he wasn't going to give us politics as usual.  I mean, if you look at  George W. Bush, who was more policy issues.  You know, he tackled social  security reform which went down in flames after the election.  I think a  lot of people don't think it was a coincidence that some even campaigns in  Iraq -- the of Second Battle of Fallujah happened right after the election  and not right before, I think people obviously -- if you lose the election,  you lose the agenda.  So when you're the president, you can sort of say to  yourself, well, maybe I'm not doing this for a purely political reason, but  I'm doing it in the long-run for the policy gains.</p><p>But I think right here what's interesting is that you actually have the  \"Post\" saying this is much worse.  The \"Washington Post\" reported that it  was worse than its predecessors. And I think it's actually coming back to  haunt him with the healthcare.  You know, there's been a lot of complaints  from the contractors who've been kind of quiet, you know, they don't want  to get beaten up too bad, but when they have responded, why did things go  wrong?  They said well a lot of these regulations went out late, you know.   There have been with the website in terms of how they structured it whether  you can browse it -- well these decisions weren't made until after the  election.  So I think really a lot of the problems with the healthcare  website -- we might find this out in the long -- after we do more  investigating -- that this is because of these political decisions which  have really come back to bite the president.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  A.B., does he have any stock -- any credibility stock --  because he's, you know -- the healthcare is a nightmare and he doesn't have  a lot of friends on Capitol Hill.  What does he have going for him?</p><p>STODDARD:  Well, he has three more years.  And that's really about it at  this point.  He has an economy I would mention that you know is going in  the right direction and if it were to make considerable gains in the next  18 months or so, I think -- I believe -- that could turn things around.   For him, ultimately -- </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Except, except for (inaudible) there's one problem though  and that's that he's got to get -- if he loses the Senate, he's got  nothing.</p><p>STODDARD:  Oh, no, and that's possible.  Like I said, I don't know that the  economy will make gains to convince the public that he did the right think  until after the midterm elections anyway.  I think between now and the next  year, we're going to look at a closer scrutiny of his regulations process - - what is he going to do before -- what will he release in 2014 before the  midterms or will he release afterwards?  He's going to have a night and day  oversight of the Affordable Care Act.  He is really in a bind right now  because there's no path out -- there's nothing else to talk about.  They  can keep talking about immigration reform, but it's not something  Republicans are interested in as a party.  Maybe sometime late summer but  maybe not.  And so for President Obama, the only thing he can do is work  night and day to restore his credibility on healthcare.  I really think his  entire presidency is tied to whether that turns around or fails.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Panel, thank you very much.  And let's all go \"Off the  Record\" for just a minute.  On Thursday, I flew to Iraq with Reverend  Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse and went to a Syrian refugee camp in  Iraq.  I did it for two important reasons -- first of all, I want to do a  good job for you.  I want you to know what's going on in the world --  that's my job -- and I do a better job for you when I see something  firsthand -- not just from reading about it on an internet or off a  computer screen.  Second, I go because I care, and I know you care too.   Yes, things aren't perfect here at home and we do needs lots of help here,  but Americans have big hearts, and we try to do as much as we can for  everyone.  And that does include refugees -- people fleeing for their lives  from their governments, they're so desperate, so cold and hungry and in  great despair.  It's a pretty grim scene. Now, Reverend Graham and I walked the refugee camp, seeing people --  children, adults -- shivering from this frigid Iraqi winter weather.  We  met a 90-year-old woman draped in blankets, desperately trying to get warm.  There are a few heaters, but thousands and thousands of refugees are there,  and winter has set in with a vengeance.   So upon seeing this misery, Reverend Graham told his team to buy 2,000  heaters and get them there immediately.  That's big.  And he could do that  because so many of you have generously donated to Samaritan's Purse.  Your  contributions take a big difference in people's lives.  And of course  Americans can't help everybody in every place, but we all try to do what we  can and that's how I spent my weekend.  And you'll see more of this journey  to the Iraqi refugee camp in an upcoming special edition of \"Fox Files\"  that's coming soon on TV.  And of course I've already posted photographs on  gretawire, so go see them.  That's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight.   But if you have an important story or issue you think I should take \"Off  the Record,\" go to gretawire.com and tell us about it. And coming up, nearly two months Nick Diez went \"On the Record\" to tell you  about is canceled healthcare plan.  So, has he had any luck finding a new  plan?  Nick is back to tell you next, and don't forget tonight, 10:00 p.m.,  \"Hannity.\"  Sean's investigating into new Obamacare navigators who are  accused of telling Americans to commit fraud.  That's tonight, an all-new  \"Hannity\" at 10:00 p.m. eastern.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Our next guest went \"On the Record\" in October just after  Obamacare's rollout.  His insurance company had canceled his plan, so  nearly two months later, has he had any luck finding a new plan?  Nick Diez  joins us.  Good evening.</p><p>NICK DIEZ, INSURANCE PLAN CANCELED DUE TO OBAMACARE:  Hi, Greta.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  So, Nick, I know that your wife had breast cancer and so you  had particular challenges in trying to find the right policy for your  family.  So, tell me, have you found that?</p><p>DIEZ:  We have not.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Well, you're coming up on December 23rd, I guess you know  you have a few more days beyond that, but so, what's been the problem?</p><p>DIEZ:  Well, there's been a number of problems, Greta.  As you know, we  tried to every way possible to try to find some coverage and every time we  went in one direction, we got turned around and had to start trying again.   Come to find out the other day that the insurance companies that are  offering ACA plans in South Carolina are not offering the doctors and  hospitals that we've been accustomed to using so now we're in a quandary. We don't know what to do, and to make matters worse, I found out from an  insurance agent today that I was trying to work with that since we didn't  get our application in by this past weekend, that we're definitely going to  be without coverage January 1st, so we're going to go at least one month  without any insurance coverage.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  You know, Nick, I find it absolutely cruel that your family  has had to deal with cancer, and I know from just studying for the segment  tonight, that your wife can't have the oncologist that she's been dealing  with.  You know, this whole idea that you could keep your doctor if you  like it -- I mean, here we have life-threatening illnesses and we have a  good relationship and a doctor who has kept your wife alive and treated her  cancer, and now suddenly your lives are turned upside down.  To me, it's  appalling.</p><p>DIEZ:  Yes, it's a terrible situation.  You know, strike one, we found out  that we could not keep our plan, strike two, we now find that we can't keep  our doctors.  I guess strike three is January 1 when we're going to lose  coverage all together.  It's just a terrible situation for somebody like me  -- an average guy -- that is, you know, has been accustomed to doing what's  right and kept our family covered for all these 35 years we've been  married, and now we're at a loss for what to do.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Now, there are two companies in South Carolina that provide  insurance -- is that correct?</p><p>DIEZ:  That is correct.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  Why isn't your oncologist on it?  Is your oncologist not  allowed onto the networks?  Is there a problem -- or your wife's  oncologist, I should say.</p><p>DIEZ:  I don't know the answer to that.  The oncologist is part of a large  medical university here in South Carolina, and that's why we go to them,  and as I understand it from talking with their finance department today,  the entire medical university is not going to be part of the plans.  </p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And that would be a decision of the insurance company or the  medical -- or the medical center?</p><p>DIEZ:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  All right, I suspect that it -- I mean, maybe they've made  it untenable, but you know -- I know that doctors want to be part of  successful plans so that they can help people and take care of the  patients, and I know it's become very difficult.  Nick, you know, I only --  I hope that things turn around for you on this.  It doesn't look very  likely in the short-run, but I do wish you and your family the best of  luck.  Thank you for joining us to tonight and keep us informed --</p><p>DIEZ:  Thank you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  -- will you?</p><p>DIEZ:  (Inaudible).</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN:  And thank you for joining us -- and thank you for being with  us tonight.  We're going to see you again tomorrow night right here at 7  p.m. eastern.  Don't forget these three letters -- D-V-R.  If you're  getting home and turning on before Bill O'Reilly, pick up your DVR remote,  get a -- set series recording.  Good night from Washington.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

And do you believe Press Secretary Jay Carney really believes this?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Today, we are focusing on the savings that millions of consumers have already seen because of the health care law's provisions that produces more value for their health insurance premium dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VAN SUSTEREN: Most Americans don't agree with Jay Carney. You've heard many horror stories right here ON THE RECORD. And a new Associated Press poll shows 69 percent of the Americans say their premiums are going up. And 59 percent say their health plan and their co-payment or deductible is increasing.</p><p>Joining us is South Carolina<person><nameText>Senator Tim Scott.</nameText></person></p><p>Nice to see you, sir.</p><p><person><nameText>SEN. TIM SCOTT, </nameText></person>(R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Thank you, Greta. It's good to be back with you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So Jay Carney says thinks millions of Americans are seeing savings?</p><p>SCOTT: It is remarkable. There's no way in the world you can add tens of thousands of government employees, have a $400 million website and see premiums go down and not up. If you the look at the facts, the facts are simple. People in South Carolina -- Mr. Hucks from Greenville, South Carolina, sent me a letter. Talked to him for a little while. His premiums are going up by 75 percent. His deductible is going from $10,000 to $25,000. But his premiums are going from $450 to over $800 a month. If he wanted to go to a co-pay plan, lower deductable, $1500 a month for a family of four, he, his wife and two kids.</p><p>Premiums are skyrocketing. But the unfortunate part is premiums are about price. Deductibles and co-pay ands out-of-pocket expenses, those are about the costs. The costs are also exploding. And, unfortunately, we'll see more bad news once the seven million young people do not enroll. Next year, year two, the premiums will be based on the actuarial information, which will be dismal, which means we'll have worse rates and not better rates.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: For my life though, I can't figure it out. Jay Carney is a smart guy.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why would he put his neck out on this? And maybe he would get lucky and the miracle would happen in the next six months and the price will come crashing down and make everybody flush with cash. Right now, it doesn't look like that. So why is he sticking his neck out and saying these things, great savings?</p><p>SCOTT: I have no idea. I can tell you this. If they find a way to control the price on the front end, it means the cost will rise on the back end. You can find a way to get an insurance company to provide an insurance policy that is not rated sufficient. It only means that some how, some way, taxpayers will pick up the tab on the back end.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That is -- the American taxpayers have always been generous with the people who are down-and-out. And as we expand Medicaid, it will cost more.</p><p>SCOTT: Absolutely.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Someone has to pick up the cost some place.</p><p>SCOTT: In South Carolina alone, if we were to expand Medicaid, we would see another $2 billion in costs over the next two years. There's just no way --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What do you do about those people? I assume that people in South Carolina want healthy people -- people who are poor with health issues --</p><p>SCOTT: Absolutely.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- not to be able to get medical care. What do you do?</p><p>SCOTT: I was in Moncks Corner this morning talking about this very topic. One of the things I suggested we do to lower the cost of health insurance, not to talk about health care, but lower the cost of health insurance, we could allow for competition across the state lines and for small business owners to pool their employees together with other small business owners to reduce the rate by about 25 percent.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why didn't we do that?</p><p>SCOTT: That is one of the failures of the pre-Obamacare world. We had an opportunity to addressed things from a free-market perspective, including medical tort reform, and we didn't do it. Now, we're faced with a challenged of trying to reintroduce common sense into the marketplace. And it would work. We could also fund health care, insurance pools in states to provide those with preexisting conditions with more opportunities. The challenges get worse. If you are in a group plan, preexisting conditions are easily absorbed into a large group plan. When in an individual market, there is no group so you have to pay exceedingly higher rates to find your insurance. That is the challenged. That, coupled with out-of-pocket expenses, going from $6,000 or so to as high as 12,000, only means those folks who can't afford insurance, they get the free health care check up but they can't take care of the challenges that they find within that check up, what do we do next? What do they do next?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: There is a heartbreaker. But let me ask you about something else.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I want to talk to you about the bipartisan budget bill? The Senate has to vote on it this week. I think tomorrow. And under the bill, military retirement benefits will be cut by $6 billion over the next 10 years. Is it going to pass the Senate?</p><p>SCOTT: I think it will probably pass the Senate, watching and listening to my colleagues on the floor just now when we were voting. It seems the votes to get beyond cloture, the 60-vote threshold, will happen, which means you only need 51 for the underlying bill. The real challenge is, if you are a young guy, you sign up for the military and are 18 or 19 years old, you get a promise, that promise is we'll do what we're going to do for the next -- rest of your life. You retire at 42. And start looking for America to honor the promise, and we say, we made a promise but we're going to break that promise by changing the retirement benefit. And for a 42- year-old E-7, enlisted man, he loses about $75,000 in the next 20 years.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That sounds horrible. I want to support our military in any particular way, but that's the same thing we are hearing like when they restructure in Detroit, when, all of the sudden, people lose pensions.</p><p>SCOTT: Yeah.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That is always the situation. How do we accommodate them? What would you have done differently? Rather than penalize the military in this instance, what would you have done differently?</p><p>SCOTT: What I would love for us to have a serious conversation about in Congress is the fact that we have over 1200 duplicative programs that cost the taxpayers $200 billion. Here is an opportunity to reduce our spending and deal with our realities and challenges face on, and not put that on the back of our military.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And for the life of me, I can't figure out why that never happens. Senator Tom Coburn has been talking about all the duplicate programs.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And the GAO has a report every year. And everybody just ignores it. I don't know why we pay for it. That's another expense. We pay for a report we ignore.</p><p>SCOTT: We have more Iraqi economic development plans that cost $26 million to American taxpayers.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So why does that keep happening?</p><p>SCOTT: There's a number of bills that suggest how we can deal with it in a pragmatic approach. It never finds it --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But why?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, I would say call Senator Reid. Everybody call Senator Reid and ask why he won't he let these votes on the floor?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You blame him?</p><p>SCOTT: I blame the process. I certainly blame the leadership of the Senate today because, at the end of the day, we are not tackling the tough issues. One of the challenges, even in this budget deal, is we allowed ourselves to have two more years of spending, but how are we going to pay for it? The offsets happen over 10 years. Remember back to 2011, when we were going to pay for the increase in the debt ceiling over the next 10 years, well, here we sit 24 months later, looking for a new way to deal with the financial challenges.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are you going to vote for the bill?</p><p>SCOTT: I'm not going to vote for this bill tomorrow. There's just no way for -- I think it is a step forward. It's good that both sides are talking. That's good. We're having real pension reform. That's good. But there's two steps back. There's the ugly and bad. The bad is that we're paying for it over 10 years. The ugly is that we're asking our military to pay for it for us, and not taking care of our responsibilities by cutting spending. We are simply shifting who pays in our current active duty military. That's ugly.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What happens when we get to the debt ceiling issue in February or March?</p><p>SCOTT: Hopefully, we won't have another one-year increase with 10-years to pay for it. Hopefully, we'll do something more logical by looking at the underlying debt, giving ourselves an opportunity to have a source conversation. It's good that Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan are having conversations. If we continue that, perhaps we can find a real solution that actually cut spending enough to have a discussion on the debt ceiling.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, always nice to see you, sir.</p><p>SCOTT: Thank you so much.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Straight ahead, new information about some Obamacare navigators. Should there be a criminal investigation? What are the navigators doing and could it get you in trouble? Congressman Trey Gowdy is here next.</p><p>And you can \"Hash It Out\" with us. We know you have an opinion about this one. Will Obamacare save your family money in the long run or will it crush your finances? Tweet or post on Facebook right now using #great.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: This is a FOX News alert. The hunt is on right now for two killers behind a deadly mall carjacking. At an upscale shopping mall, a young couple out doing holiday shopping is suddenly attacked in a parking lot outside of a Nordstrom store. The husband had opened the car door for his wife and walked around to the driver's door when it happened.</p><p>WNYW FOX New York's Sharon Crowley joins us from the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.</p><p>Tell me what is the latest?</p><p>SHARON CROWLEY, CORRESPONDENT, WNYW FOX NEW YORK: Yeah, what a sad story just before Christmas as well.</p><p>What you reported is true. It was just as the mall was closing. He and his wife were returning to their SUV and getting in the car. 30-year-old Dustin Friedlander, of Hoboken, New Jersey. He and his wife both attorneys. Just finished shopping. She is sitting in the passenger side and he's just about to get in the driver's side door when he's ambushed by two, police say, thugs who were trying to carjack his expensive SUV. They shot him in the head, police say, and sped off in his car. His wife was screaming. The mall, the Short Hills Mall, a very affluent, expensive, luxurious mall, was put in a lookdown for a short time. He was transported to the hospital but died a short time later.</p><p>Tonight, Greta, police have not found the gunmen. They are looking for two suspects who sped off in the stolen car and another vehicle that they were seen in, a green Subaru. There's an extensive reward being offered for their arrest.</p><p>Earlier, we had breaking developments on this story. The stolen SUV was found in Newark, Newark, New Jersey, in a high-crime area next to an abandoned home which sources tell us is well-known for car thieves. They often drop the stolen cars there in that area.</p><p>So one of the possibilities tonight they are looking at is whether they are connected to a larger car theft ring. Right now, no arrests have been made.</p><p>The Short Hills Mall has been reopened. We talked with shoppers today. Greta, people are on edge. Security here is very, very tight. And there is a visible police presence. There always is. But the mall is reviewing its security procedures and has added police officers.</p><p>And another important development, they will be looking at any security cameras in the mall-level parking lot or stores around there to see if that will assist them, Greta, in solving this crime.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Sharon, for the life of me, I can't understand why they haven't released that videotape already. This is a manhunt for two killers. They could kill again. They've shown they are capable of killing. This happened Saturday night and the videotape -- the place has to be loaded with security cameras in the parking lot. Why aren't the videotapes released already so we can put them out there for people to help?</p><p>CROWLEY: Absolutely right. Greta, that it is something that -- the Essex County prosecutor's office is the lead investigator on this case. We've been in touch with them. That is certainly something you would think that would help in this case, especially the high-end retail stores, Nordstrom and Sak's Fifth Avenue. These stores you know are loaded with security cameras inside and outside of the building and in the parking lot. Certainly that would be helpful if we were able to see that. Unless, of course, police are closing in on exactly who they are looking for.</p><p>One of the things that investigators said in this case is that usually the carjackers, although carjacking is violent, they steal the car. They don't shoot and kill the driver as well. That is unusual. And in this area, Short Hills, Milburn, New Jersey, it is a very affluent, very low-crime area. So this is a highly unusual event in this area.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: I might add, when you carjack a car, unless you have gloves on, you would leave a lot clues and fibers, if you sneeze, anything, DNA all over the inside of the car, so that car could be a wealth of information to try to track down these two killers.</p><p>We'll stay on this story and Sharon will as well.</p><p>Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>CROWLEY: OK, thank you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Obamacare navigators telling you to break the law. What are they doing and why are they doing it? Congressman Trey Gowdy is here, coming up.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Are Obamacare navigators breaking the law? A new report shows many of them are telling you to commit fraud. The report claims some Obamacare navigators telling people to lie on their health care applications in order to get better credits and subsidies. Guess what? That is a fraud. That's illegal. You can go to jail for that stuff.</p><p>Congressman Trey Gowdy joins us.</p><p>Good evening, sir.</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY, (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Good evening. How are you?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Very well.</p><p>Am I right this is one of the suspicions that navigators are telling people how to commit a crime?</p><p>GOWDY: It is more than a suspicion. There are at least two tapes that I'm aware of. One was lie about your finances and the other was lie about your preexisting habit of smoking, both of which would impact your premium you're your subsidy.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And I am looking at the U.S. House of Representatives report. I have a copy right here. And I will read the part you were just talking about. It says, \"Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance applications so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recording advising applicants to lie about smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium.\"</p><p>Has this been referred to the Department of Justice of to the local U.S. attorney?</p><p>GOWDY: I doubt it. Nothing much seems to get referred these days for criminal prosecution. I don't even know whether they've lost their job, Greta. I know the young lady who made the mistakes of answering Sean Hannity's questions on the phone lost her job. I don't even know if these two have lost their job. But there is no background check and it's 20 hours of training. You undergo more training to be a life guard at a reflection poll than you do to be a navigator. And you can take the test as many times as you need to. Think of how well you would have done in school if you could keep taking the test until you pass it.</p><p>The navigator thing -- it is a shame you have to have a navigator to access a federal program to begin with. Then, no background check and 20 hours of training and taking the test as many times as you want, and then you can council people to commit frauds once you want to enroll.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: It's basic law, for those who are unaware. If you participate and aid and abet someone in committing a crime, you are just as guilty as a principle. Every time you do it, it's another count. If you do it with five people as a navigator, those are five felony counts right there. Right?</p><p>GOWDY: Well, we can't even get the GAO -- yeah, you are right. It's aiding and abetting. And if you know about it, and don't report it, it's a felony. But we can't get anybody prosecuted by this Department of Justice. So hold out no hope. I will just settle if they don't get to keep their jobs and counsel more people.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But why -- why did you have to go all the way to Justice. Why can't you have the U.S. attorney in Dallas or the first assistant to call them up and say convene a grand jury? You don't have to get permission from Eric Holder. If you start an investigation and Eric Holder suddenly stepped on it, from D.C. to Dallas, that would raise holy hell within the ranks of the U.S. attorneys.</p><p>GOWDY: It has happen before. But you are right. The U.S. attorney and the district in Texas that happens to be could do that. And for all I know, they may be working on it. I think it is a shame, if you have on tape somebody counseling someone else to commit a fraud against the taxpayers, and there is no sanction or consequence. It would be a nice start if you just lost your job before you got referred for criminal prosecutions.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: We should make note, when you talk about the subsidies, if you're trying to -- if they are lying about his or her income so they get a subsidy, that means taxpayers pay extra money out of their pocket to some insurance company. Taxpayers, they are the ones that suffer financially.</p><p>GOWDY: You have the whole concept of unjust enrichment. But, Greta, for whatever reason, people seem to treat government money differently than they do their own, and it is OK to lie to get a higher subsidy or I -- Yeah, we have a lot of issues in this country, morality being one of them. I just can't believe that someone -- the taxpayers are paying the salary for a navigator that's counseling someone to defraud taxpayers out of money. I would love to leave Congress and prosecute the case myself, and the one you referenced in the last segment as well</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you about the contracts and the subpoena. I have a copy of a letter that was sent to Chairman Darrell Issa, and the letter is from Alfred Grasso and it's the MITRE Corporation. He's trying to explain why it is that he doesn't want to comply directly with the subpoena from the House Oversight Committee. He is one of the contractors. What is his excuse for not complying with a subpoena?</p><p>GOWDY: There is a contract that forbids him from making disclosures to third partnerships. But I've got news for Kathleen Sebelius, Congress is not a third party. And my guess is that gentlemen, if he hasn't sought legal counsel and concluded he needs to comply with this subpoena very shortly, will. Two contractors reached the right conclusion. Which if between Kathleen Sebelius and Darrell Issa, you are better off doing what Darrell Issa tells you to do.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Will Congress and Chairman Issa put their foot down and get these documents? There's always such a long dance in getting them. If it is a subpoena, they should provide them no questions asked.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, then we'll fight over the redactions. Lots of the documents are redacted. And then, Greta, you don't know what you don't know. So if the contractor gives information but it's not a total disclosure, we don't know what we don't have. Underlying your question is also, why does nothing ever happen to people who don't do what Congress tells them to do? That's a recurring conversation that you and I have. The fact that Kathleen Sebelius, if -- if told someone not to conform to a subpoena, even if they do, I would encourage Chairman Issa to still investigate it. To me, it is not alls well that ends well. If you counsel someone to impede a congressional investigation, even if they don't take your advice, I would love to see them investigated. And my suspicion is that my advice would be well received by Chairman Issa.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: The irony is they all work for us. The contractors are getting paid with our money as taxpayers. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of HHS, works for us. We are the only ones who don't get the information. Everyone is taking our money and having secret contracts that we can't even see and we don't even know how they're spending our money. We don't even know what is in the contracts.</p><p>GOWDY: Not only are they taking your money but they're taking your personal information. This is what all of this is about, is whether or not your information is secure. And I have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to convene a special College of Cardinals to keep Darrell Issa from getting information so he can know whether or not your data is secure or not.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOWDY: It's not just your money, it's also -- yes, ma'am.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: It is also your personal stuff.</p><p>Congressman, thank you very much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. But thank you, sir.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. And have a good night.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, too,</p><p>Coming up, he has the big and flashy ads and the big celebrities in his back pocket. But are young Americans now turning on President Obama, and why? That's next?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now get ready to \"Speed Read\" your way through the news.</p><p>A big setback today for President Obama and NSA. Today, a federal judge ruling the NSA's domestic phone spying program unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for future appeals and court challenges. And tomorrow, President Obama meets with the heads of all the big tech companies to talk about moving forward from the spying scandal.</p><p>And it's not over -- a new dangerous winter storm sweeping across America from the Midwest to the northeast. Many people are getting a second battering of wild winter weather. And tonight many places hit with even more snow. This latest flash is paralyzing much of the Midwest tonight. And are you ready to play \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\" Well, you better grab a Mega Millions ticket -- the jackpot climbing all the way up to $586 million. That big drawing? That's tomorrow. And if nobody wins before Christmas, it could be a very merry holiday for someone because the jackpot could climb to $1 billion. And that's tonight's \"Speed Read.\" And the flashy ads of big-name celebrities in a gigantic social media push. HHS is pulling out all the stops to get millennials -- yes, those are the young people -- to sign up for Obamacare. But do millennials want Obamacare or do they even -- do they even want President Obama in office anymore? A poll just out showing a majority of millennials disapprove of the president's performance. Forty-six percent disapprove of President Obama's job performance, while just 45 percent approve. And now, our panel going \"On the Record\" -- A.B. Stoddard from the Hill, John McCormack from the \"Weekly Standard\" and Susan Ferrechio from the \"Washington Examiner.\" A.B., first to you -- your description of the Obamacare rollout is a turn off to the millennials, so how does Obama administration undo that turn off?</p><p>A.B. STODDARD, \"THE HILL\": Well it's going to take a lot of work. I mean, I think that this is a generation of kids who are well informed, that are internet savvy, they also are struggling to find an anchor in the middle class and get their first few jobs and establish themselves with some kind of financial security. They know, if they've read about this, that it's off to a rocky start if you -- just because you get into the web -- to the website -- doesn't mean you actually end up purchasing insurance. And they might've also found out that the non-compliance fee in the first year is only $95 and it's very difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to collect. So, all of the signals from the administration to these people are we can't handle what we promised. They have to do the reverse, they have to start talking about the benefits of getting insurance -- the ease of getting insurance. Otherwise, I think these people are going to say 'Sounds like there's a lot of waivers and extensions and problems, maybe we'll just sit it out and see what they come up -- it must be changing sometime soon.'</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: John, so now we're going to have this sort of P.R. campaign where they're going to try and tell everybody this is great, all the millennials says it's fantastic.</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, \"WEEKLY STAR\": That's what they're going for, but I don't think any marketing campaign can really save them from this law. A there's one study out that said that 80 percent of people under the age of 30 are going to pay more for health insurance under Obamacare, even with the subsidies. So, unless you make less than 200 percent of the poverty level, you're definitely going to be worse off. So the real problem isn't marketing, it's just simple economics. I mean, you have to look at the fact that there are millions of people out there who didn't have health insurance because they thought it was a bad deal before Obamacare. They made it cost more, and why would they sign up for it now?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I agree with that and I also think if you look, there's another poll that says most young people feel like the law is not going to be around for much longer -- that it's going to end up being repealed or it's going to collapse. Why sign up for something that's not going to be there for them? I mean, they're willing to wait in line overnight for an iPhone which they're going to get and hold in their hand and have something for it, but for students -- people with student loans, their parents don't have as much money to help them out, you know, they're struggling to pay their rent, to pay their $100 a month cell phone bill. I looked at some of the costs for young people all around the country -- you're looking at costs 2, $300 a month for big deductibles, $5,000 for a plan that only covers 60% and you know I just -- for young people, it's not going to add up. I think it's going to be really tough to get them enrolled.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So, what happens if they don't? Everybody's got such a grim view that nothing -- that you know they're not going to sign up, so with them not going to sign up, who's going to pay for this, A.B.?</p><p>STODDARD: Well, that's going to be a problem that's worked out in 2014. The prices for 2014 have been set, the insurance companies are going to look after March 31 at just how many people were enrolled. The administration said to sustain the program, they're looking at a risk balance of three to one -- one young healthy person to every three sick, risky elder people. If that doesn't work out, and that equation is out of whack, we're going to see prices rise in 2015 and that's how it's going to get paid for.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Spike or ride? Spike or ride?</p><p>STODDARD: Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if we're going to be doing a taxpayer bailout of the insurance companies combined with higher prices or all higher premiums. I don't know how it's going to break up.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: What's the best news for Obama administration on Obamacare?</p><p>MCCORMACK: The best news -- I'm stumped. Honestly --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know, Susan, if there's any good news coming out of this?</p><p>FERRECHIO: Well, I would think that if they can find a way to help the insurance companies through these risk corridors where there's some money that the administration can use where they don't have to go through Congress, that might be able to sustain it for another year. And if they have you know see that Hollywood on their side trying to promote this thing, they may be able to get more people enrolled. I mean, they do have you know Hollywood backing them with the big promotional campaign -- it's possible.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: But I don't even see a lot of sympathy from the insurance companies. The insurance companies are trying to knock the -- you know, like Mayo Clinic and M.D. Anderson -- they're trying to keep them out of the mix because they're expensive place to get medical care. I mean, the insurance companies are not making them particularly sympathetic like you want to help them.</p><p>STODDARD: I think that's easy for the administration to dump on the insurance company -- companies -- when things go bad. Just like when President Obama had to admit the people who were self-insured and were promised they were going to get to keep their policy they elected, actually had just lost it and couldn't have it -- the law was never going to let them. It's easy to knock the insurance companies and say, 'Well, we had to make those -- we had to outlaw those plans because they were so terrible.'</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Yes, but isn't the president aligned with them -- I mean --</p><p>STODDARD: Oh, my God --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- isn't the president joined at the hip with the insurance companies? How can he blame the insurance companies:?</p><p>STODDARD: The insurance companies -- the insurance industry cannot collapse. They insure us. If it's not made right for them the whole thing collapses on itself -- this death spiral of price increases that everyone talks about as a worst-case scenario. We can't just blame the insurance companies. They've now taken in the sick. This has to work. And so the best news for the Obama administration in some states -- some of the -- you know, the percentage targets are being reached for enrollment -- those are largely in states that are running their own exchanges, not the ones that are under healthcare.gov. If they can somehow fit -- align -- the enrollment with the purchasing and make sure that more people are insured, and convince young people, they might meet their target numbers.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right, panel if you'll stand by, because we'll be back with you a little bit later. Straight ahead, did President Obama deliberately delay important regulations to keep his job? New evidence tonight points right to the Whitehouse. That's coming up next. Also, these men and women hitting the streets in Santa costumes. But then something went terribly wrong. More of this wild video up next.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now it's time to show you what we are watching. We've put together the most fantastic videos out there tonight. Take a look -- naughty or nice? Apparently not all Santas play by the same rules. This group getting very naughty, drawing punches and pushing each other to the ground, all of it caught on camera. Hundreds of people dressed as Santa hit the streets of New York City each year for SantaCon. It's mostly a pub crawl, but clearly this group of Santas hit the bottle a bit too hard. Talk about holiday spirit. And winter sports aren't just for humans. Check out this bird who apparently forgot he or she can fly. The bird turning a jar lid into a sled. Watch as this creature hops on board and slides right down the roof. Now that looks fun, but next time it'd probably be a lot easier just to use his wings. And this is the strangest yet coolest Christmas card our \"On the Record\" staff has seen in years. Meet the (Holderness) family.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(SINGING CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now, the \"On the Record\" staff wants me to make one of these, but I think I'll wait until the staff does its first. And that's what we are watching tonight. And coming up, new evidence that President Obama may have deliberately dragged his feet about something important to you just to get reelected. What was it? And is he any different from other presidents? Your \"On the Record\" political panel is back next.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: President Obama delay important environmental regulations to keep his own job? Well there's new evidence he pushed back some EPA changes until after the 2012 election, but do all presidents do this essentially -- just play us? Our \"On the Record\" panel is back. And first (inaudible) is a \"Washington Post\" article suggested that the Obama administration has egregiously been playing the delay game to get reelected. What's the problem?</p><p>FERRECHIO: I think the important quote in that story was the word went out from the Whitehouse according to one administration official that they were not anxious to have these regulations under review because of the upcoming election. I mean, it says it all right there -- that they were really concerned about their reelection prospect. And it goes beyond just the environmental regulations. I think there's a lot of suspicion that the healthcare law was -- you know -- things were promised when maybe people realized those promises would not be kept because they wanted to preserve the president's -- you know -- how he could sell himself to voters. I mean, there was worried about him -- them -- changing, you know, the nuisances of how he explained the health care law because they were worried about reelection. And what it does is it cost him the trust of the public, and then as a consequence, Democrats overall are not trusted. And they're the ones who are going to be in the hot seat in 2014. This is a campaign now that rights itself. It's like -- do you trust these Democrats to be your senator or your representative.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Is President Obama any worse, John, than other administrations that's put -- part one of my question -- the second part is pushing us off these regulations until after the election. I mean, Congress does it overtly. They put all deadlines after the election. I mean, the Obama administration's just doing something toward sneaky, under the table that Congress does overtly.</p><p>MCCORMACK: Well, I think putting controversial policy decisions until after an election is politics as usual. But, again, from a president who said he wasn't going to give us politics as usual. I mean, if you look at George W. Bush, who was more policy issues. You know, he tackled social security reform which went down in flames after the election. I think a lot of people don't think it was a coincidence that some even campaigns in Iraq -- the of Second Battle of Fallujah happened right after the election and not right before, I think people obviously -- if you lose the election, you lose the agenda. So when you're the president, you can sort of say to yourself, well, maybe I'm not doing this for a purely political reason, but I'm doing it in the long-run for the policy gains.</p><p>But I think right here what's interesting is that you actually have the \"Post\" saying this is much worse. The \"Washington Post\" reported that it was worse than its predecessors. And I think it's actually coming back to haunt him with the healthcare. You know, there's been a lot of complaints from the contractors who've been kind of quiet, you know, they don't want to get beaten up too bad, but when they have responded, why did things go wrong? They said well a lot of these regulations went out late, you know. There have been with the website in terms of how they structured it whether you can browse it -- well these decisions weren't made until after the election. So I think really a lot of the problems with the healthcare website -- we might find this out in the long -- after we do more investigating -- that this is because of these political decisions which have really come back to bite the president.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: A.B., does he have any stock -- any credibility stock -- because he's, you know -- the healthcare is a nightmare and he doesn't have a lot of friends on Capitol Hill. What does he have going for him?</p><p>STODDARD: Well, he has three more years. And that's really about it at this point. He has an economy I would mention that you know is going in the right direction and if it were to make considerable gains in the next 18 months or so, I think -- I believe -- that could turn things around. For him, ultimately --</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Except, except for (inaudible) there's one problem though and that's that he's got to get -- if he loses the Senate, he's got nothing.</p><p>STODDARD: Oh, no, and that's possible. Like I said, I don't know that the economy will make gains to convince the public that he did the right think until after the midterm elections anyway. I think between now and the next year, we're going to look at a closer scrutiny of his regulations process - - what is he going to do before -- what will he release in 2014 before the midterms or will he release afterwards? He's going to have a night and day oversight of the Affordable Care Act. He is really in a bind right now because there's no path out -- there's nothing else to talk about. They can keep talking about immigration reform, but it's not something Republicans are interested in as a party. Maybe sometime late summer but maybe not. And so for President Obama, the only thing he can do is work night and day to restore his credibility on healthcare. I really think his entire presidency is tied to whether that turns around or fails.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Panel, thank you very much. And let's all go \"Off the Record\" for just a minute. On Thursday, I flew to Iraq with Reverend Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse and went to a Syrian refugee camp in Iraq. I did it for two important reasons -- first of all, I want to do a good job for you. I want you to know what's going on in the world -- that's my job -- and I do a better job for you when I see something firsthand -- not just from reading about it on an internet or off a computer screen. Second, I go because I care, and I know you care too. Yes, things aren't perfect here at home and we do needs lots of help here, but Americans have big hearts, and we try to do as much as we can for everyone. And that does include refugees -- people fleeing for their lives from their governments, they're so desperate, so cold and hungry and in great despair. It's a pretty grim scene. Now, Reverend Graham and I walked the refugee camp, seeing people -- children, adults -- shivering from this frigid Iraqi winter weather. We met a 90-year-old woman draped in blankets, desperately trying to get warm. There are a few heaters, but thousands and thousands of refugees are there, and winter has set in with a vengeance. So upon seeing this misery, Reverend Graham told his team to buy 2,000 heaters and get them there immediately. That's big. And he could do that because so many of you have generously donated to Samaritan's Purse. Your contributions take a big difference in people's lives. And of course Americans can't help everybody in every place, but we all try to do what we can and that's how I spent my weekend. And you'll see more of this journey to the Iraqi refugee camp in an upcoming special edition of \"Fox Files\" that's coming soon on TV. And of course I've already posted photographs on gretawire, so go see them. That's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight. But if you have an important story or issue you think I should take \"Off the Record,\" go to gretawire.com and tell us about it. And coming up, nearly two months Nick Diez went \"On the Record\" to tell you about is canceled healthcare plan. So, has he had any luck finding a new plan? Nick is back to tell you next, and don't forget tonight, 10:00 p.m., \"Hannity.\" Sean's investigating into new Obamacare navigators who are accused of telling Americans to commit fraud. That's tonight, an all-new \"Hannity\" at 10:00 p.m. eastern.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Our next guest went \"On the Record\" in October just after Obamacare's rollout. His insurance company had canceled his plan, so nearly two months later, has he had any luck finding a new plan? Nick Diez joins us. Good evening.</p><p>NICK DIEZ, INSURANCE PLAN CANCELED DUE TO OBAMACARE: Hi, Greta.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: So, Nick, I know that your wife had breast cancer and so you had particular challenges in trying to find the right policy for your family. So, tell me, have you found that?</p><p>DIEZ: We have not.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Well, you're coming up on December 23rd, I guess you know you have a few more days beyond that, but so, what's been the problem?</p><p>DIEZ: Well, there's been a number of problems, Greta. As you know, we tried to every way possible to try to find some coverage and every time we went in one direction, we got turned around and had to start trying again. Come to find out the other day that the insurance companies that are offering ACA plans in South Carolina are not offering the doctors and hospitals that we've been accustomed to using so now we're in a quandary. We don't know what to do, and to make matters worse, I found out from an insurance agent today that I was trying to work with that since we didn't get our application in by this past weekend, that we're definitely going to be without coverage January 1st, so we're going to go at least one month without any insurance coverage.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: You know, Nick, I find it absolutely cruel that your family has had to deal with cancer, and I know from just studying for the segment tonight, that your wife can't have the oncologist that she's been dealing with. You know, this whole idea that you could keep your doctor if you like it -- I mean, here we have life-threatening illnesses and we have a good relationship and a doctor who has kept your wife alive and treated her cancer, and now suddenly your lives are turned upside down. To me, it's appalling.</p><p>DIEZ: Yes, it's a terrible situation. You know, strike one, we found out that we could not keep our plan, strike two, we now find that we can't keep our doctors. I guess strike three is January 1 when we're going to lose coverage all together. It's just a terrible situation for somebody like me -- an average guy -- that is, you know, has been accustomed to doing what's right and kept our family covered for all these 35 years we've been married, and now we're at a loss for what to do.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Now, there are two companies in South Carolina that provide insurance -- is that correct?</p><p>DIEZ: That is correct.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Why isn't your oncologist on it? Is your oncologist not allowed onto the networks? Is there a problem -- or your wife's oncologist, I should say.</p><p>DIEZ: I don't know the answer to that. The oncologist is part of a large medical university here in South Carolina, and that's why we go to them, and as I understand it from talking with their finance department today, the entire medical university is not going to be part of the plans.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And that would be a decision of the insurance company or the medical -- or the medical center?</p><p>DIEZ: I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: All right, I suspect that it -- I mean, maybe they've made it untenable, but you know -- I know that doctors want to be part of successful plans so that they can help people and take care of the patients, and I know it's become very difficult. Nick, you know, I only -- I hope that things turn around for you on this. It doesn't look very likely in the short-run, but I do wish you and your family the best of luck. Thank you for joining us to tonight and keep us informed --</p><p>DIEZ: Thank you.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: -- will you?</p><p>DIEZ: (Inaudible).</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: And thank you for joining us -- and thank you for being with us tonight. We're going to see you again tomorrow night right here at 7 p.m. eastern. Don't forget these three letters -- D-V-R. If you're getting home and turning on before Bill O'Reilly, pick up your DVR remote, get a -- set series recording. Good night from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
