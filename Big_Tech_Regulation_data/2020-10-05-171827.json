Yet companies cannot directly fund political campaigns - although internal employee-led political action committees (PAC) can. Individual donations also reflect how a company is inclined - indeed, their aggregate donations can be heftier than those scraped together by committees. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Below, we break down four sectors whose players are most active in political donations: banks and financial services, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, and technology. Looking beyond the issue of corporate tax rates, which would likely be more severe under a Biden presidency, US companies still have more to lose - or gain - depending on whether the horse they back makes it to the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     Pillitical healthcare                   </p><p>Have politics and America's healthcare industry ever been more entangled? As we write, President Trump is attempting to push through a coronavirus vaccine ahead of 3 November - seemingly believing that this will guarantee his re-election. Such enthusiasm comes despite concerns that drug-makers need more time - not to mention apparent discord between the White House and the federal medicines agency.</p><p>While we cannot know if or when an inoculation will be approved, one thing is clear: 'big pharma' remains at the forefront of the war against the pandemic. And, arguably, its tireless work to resolve the ongoing crisis has painted this much-scrutinised industry in a more positive light - making it difficult to introduce very harsh legislation. </p><p>But the threat of stricter drug-pricing controls still looms large - having dominated Washington's agenda for years. And Covid-19 has drawn greater attention to the importance of affordable healthcare. Small wonder, perhaps, that health-connected individuals and PACs have made large cash injections into this year's election.</p><p>Most of that money has gone to the Democrats. Indeed, the Republicans have received just a fifth of the health sector's donations so far - constituting a far wider gap than the 55:44 Dem-Rep ratio seen in 2016. Candidate Joe Biden has garnered $25.3m (\u00a319.5m) of the sector's contributions, versus $14.5m for President Trump. The two most generous sub-sectors are healthcare professionals and pharmaceuticals - giving Mr Biden $9.9 and $5.9m, respectively.</p><p>True, last election cycle Hillary Clinton attracted a less impressive $12.4m in pharma contributions. But at the time, donors were girding their loins for a leader who had emphatically pledged to clamp down on drug price-hikes.</p><p>Mr Biden has not shied away from that fight. He aims to \"stand up to abuse of power by prescription drug corporations\", limiting launch prices and allowing consumers to import medicine from overseas. He also seeks to expand Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA), which President Trump has sought to reverse. </p><p>But as brokerage Jefferies notes, Biden needs Democratic control of the Republican-held Senate to \"have any chance of advancing a significant healthcare agenda\". And a conservative replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could spell the end of the ACA anyway. Thus, Mr Biden's bigger ideas may ultimately be blunted - perhaps rendering him a safer bet in the eyes of the sector.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has outlined his own health strategy and a 'most-favoured-nation' plan to index certain drug prices against other countries. And while the latter idea has been poorly received by pharma giants - with Pfizer's (US:PFE) boss labelling it \"radical\" and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) body calling it \"an irresponsible and unworkable policy\" - uncertainty prevails once more. Who knows how far the unpredictable President would actually follow through with his intentions?</p><p>Whatever happens, the health sector will continue to try to influence policy in America, in-and-out of election cycles. Last year alone, PhRMA spent a cool $29.3m on lobbying activity. Time will tell whether such disbursement helps big pharma and Washington to compromise on the key issues at stake. HC</p><p>                     Banks/financial services                   </p><p>As is now standard practice in a US presidential election cycle, Wall Street has spent more than any other sector to date. It is also backing Joe Biden. As of 21 September, individuals employed in the loosely defined finance, real estate and insurance sector have committed a total of $86.7m to the Democratic candidate, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>This support is reflected across the sector's two largest sub-groups. Donors from the world of hedge funds and private equity have so far coughed up $34.1m for Biden's campaign, while individuals employed in securities and investment banking have put in $51.1m.</p><p>That compares with contributions to the Trump campaign of $5.8m and $10.5m, respectively, although these figures mask the $28.4m spent on support for Republican politicians including Trump since 2019 by Stephen Schwarzmann, chief executive of the giant private equity group Blackstone and the largest single active Wall Street donor.</p><p>The disclosures may seem counterintuitive for a sector long associated with support for corporate tax breaks and deregulation. The view that finance tends to support any policy that is pro-market is also backed up by recent history. After Barack Obama pushed through legislation aimed to curb the banking excesses that led to the global financial crisis, finance contributions to his re-election bid in 2012 slumped to $21.1m. Four years before, Wall Street had thrown its full weight behind the Democratic party, spending a then-record $78.3m - 21 per cent more than the GOP.</p><p>Sector contributions to the Democrats' electoral push are now ahead of Republicans for the first time since Obama's inaugural victory, although Hillary Clinton's bid remains the single most Wall-Street funded run to date.</p><p>The 2016 Democratic candidate, who served as New York senator from 2001 to 2009, received $117m from finance, insurance and real estate backers. By contrast, Trump - whose first term has brought corporate and high-income tax cuts, as well as pushbacks on financial reform - received just $37.9m in 2016, in part because of a wide Republican nominee field. Judged purely on dollar campaign contributions, financiers' early preference had been for Jeb Bush. </p><p>In a similar sense, Wall Street's support for Biden can partially be understood for who he is not. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, early contenders in the race for the Democratic nomination, were both expected to take more combative stances against finance and corporate America.</p><p>Then again, although financial regulation has fallen off the election agenda, Biden does not appear the closest of allies to the industry. His fiscal proposals - including higher payroll taxes, a 28 per cent corporate tax rate and doubling levies on US companies' income on overseas intangible assets - could knock 8 per cent from earnings for the S&amp;P 500 Index, say analysts at UBS. Sector contributions this year may be a clearer sign of individual political preference than naked self-interest after all. AN</p><p>                     Oil and gas                   </p><p>Joe Biden will not take oil and gas donations. In any case, his green new deal support and plan to end drilling on federal land would have made him an unlikely target for fossil fuel cash. </p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump has proudly cut environmental restrictions, permitting hurdles and the Obama Clean Power Plan, ensuring much affection from the oil and gas industry. </p><p>Earlier in September, Bureau of Land Management documents uncovered by Accountable.US showed the administration had also cut royalties from some projects on federal land from 12.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in reaction to the oil price crash in March. </p><p>According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the oil and gas industry has donated $12.7m to the Trump campaign and groups supporting it, and less than $1m to the Biden campaign. Even the sub-$1m amount is a surprise, given it will not reach the official campaign itself. </p><p>Mr Biden has positioned himself as a green alternative, jumping on board the Green New Deal launched by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey last year. The Democratic nominee said he would sign the US up to the Paris Agreement again, bring in a net zero carbon emissions by 2050 target, and put $1.7 trillion into green infrastructure in the next decade. Fossil fuel companies will be most concerned about how Mr Biden will pay for this: raising corporation taxes and cutting fossil fuel subsidies. </p><p>The industry is also worried about the plan to ban drilling on federal land. The American Petroleum Institute (API) said it would result in 350,000 jobs disappearing by 2022, with Texas seeing the biggest impact. The API even claims coal use will go up if gas supply falls from the policy and chip away at the country's energy independence. </p><p>The industry is not getting every single thing it wants from President Trump. In early September, he extended an Obama-era ban on drilling in waters off the coast of Florida, according to the Associated Press. Mr Biden has also said he would ban offshore drilling. </p><p>This is a high stakes game for the oil and gas industry. Extractives companies could not have hoped for a better friend in the White House and will fight hard to keep him there. AH </p><p>                     Technology                   </p><p>The tech sector has driven much of the US stock rally that President Trump has so often celebrated on his Twitter (US:TWTR) account. But internet companies such as Twitter have also found themselves at the heart of the electoral discourse, as they grapple with fake news and hate speech on their platforms - as well as national security threats from foreign disinformation campaigns. With reports that bots had meddled with the outcome of the last election, companies such as Twitter, Facebook (US:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) have been forced to take action to protect the health of American democracy.</p><p>President Trump has a volatile relationship with the Big Tech group: Twitter even blocked some of his tweets earlier in the year, on the grounds that they \"glorified violence\". With Mark Zuckerberg identifying Silicon Valley as \"an extremely left-leaning place\", it is perhaps little wonder that the majority in the 'internet' industry have chosen to back the ostensibly more liberal Biden - with 97 per cent of $13m-worth of donations fed to the Democrats.</p><p>But this could be to their detriment. This past summer there has been much commotion on Capitol Hill about antitrust behaviour in the industry: the chief executives of Facebook, Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN) and Alphabet were all called to testify at a Congressional hearing in August. Democrats typically come down harder on antitrust issues than Republicans. Yet individuals at Amazon, the company with the second-largest market value in the group, have pumped $0.7m into Biden's campaign, seven times the amount that they have contributed to Trump. Indeed, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has officially endorsed the ex-vice President for the 2020 election. </p><p>And it not just internet companies - individual donations from Microsoft (US:MSFT) to the Biden campaign have surpassed $0.8m. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that Biden has so far refrained from joining the call to break up Big Tech firms, saying it would be premature to make a judgement without a formal investigation. It seems that the industry is betting that Biden will take his cue from the legacy of Obama's more Silicon Valley-friendly approach. LA</p><p>                     To the polls                   </p><p>A contested US election was the biggest investment worry for 2020 in a poll carried out by deVere Group. It was the most pressing concern for 72 per cent of respondents, with worries of a second wave of coronavirus trailing behind at just 18 per cent.</p><p>A contested election will take a while to clarify - complicated by coronavirus restrictions and the complex processes of mass postal voting. It will \"almost inevitably send the stock markets into a temporary tailspin - and this is weighing on investors' minds\", says deVere chief executive Nigel Green.</p><p>Current polls suggest that Biden maintains the lead. For many, Donald Trump has been a divisive, and certainly volatile, President. But there has rarely been - if ever - a political leader that connects the success of the market so closely with the economic health of the nation. Yet many of the biggest sectors do not seem to be backing him. Still, it is worth remembering that big campaign budgets and favourable polls do not always create a clear path to the White House. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-66395551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YG-XMT1-JBNF-W1BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2167\"/><timeReceived>10:27 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Yet companies cannot directly fund political campaigns - although internal employee-led political action committees (PAC) can. Individual donations also reflect how a company leans - indeed, their aggregate donations can be heftier than those scraped together by committees* Below, we break down four sectors whose players are most active in political donations: banks and financial services; pharmaceuticals; oil and gas; and technology. Looking beyond the issue of corporate tax rates, which are likely to be more severe under a Biden presidency, US companies still have more to lose - or gain - depending on whether the horse they back makes it to the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Political healthcare Have politics and America's healthcare industry ever been more entangled? As we write, President Trump is attempting to push through a coronavirus vaccine ahead of 3 November - seemingly believing that this will guarantee his re-election. Such enthusiasm comes despite concerns that drugmakers need more time - not to mention apparent discord between the White House and the federal medicines agency.</p><p>While we cannot know if or when an inoculation will be approved, one thing is clear: 'big pharma' remains at the forefront of the war against the pandemic. And, arguably, its tireless work to resolve the ongoing crisis has painted this much-scrutinised industry in a more positive light - making it difficult to introduce harsh legislation.</p><p>But the threat of stricter drug pricing controls still looms large - having dominated Washington's agenda for years. And Covid-19 has drawn greater attention to the importance of affordable healthcare. Small wonder, perhaps, that health-connected individuals and PACs have made large cash injections into this year's election.</p><p>Most of that money has gone to the Democrats.</p><p>Indeed, the Republicans have received just a fifth of the health sector's donations so far - constituting a far wider gap than the 55:44 Dem-Rep ratio seen in 2016. Candidate Joe Biden has garnered $25.3m (\u00a319.5m) of the sector's contributions, versus $14.5m for Donald Trump. The two most generous sub-sectors are healthcare professionals and pharmaceuticals - giving Mr Biden $9.9 and $5.9m, respectively.</p><p>True, last election cycle Hillary Clinton attracted a less impressive $12.4m in pharma contributions. But at the time, donors were girding their loins for a leader who had emphatically pledged to clamp down on drug price hikes.</p><p>Mr Biden has not shied away from that fight. He aims to \"stand up to abuse of power by prescription drug corporations\", limiting launch prices and allowing consumers to import medicine from overseas. He also seeks to expand Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA), which President Trump has sought to reverse.</p><p>But as brokerage Jefferies notes, Mr Biden needs Democratic control of the Republican-held Senate to \"have any chance of advancing a significant healthcare agenda\". And a conservative replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could spell the end of the ACA anyway. Thus, Mr Biden's bigger ideas may ultimately be blunted - perhaps rendering him a safer bet in the eyes of the sector.</p><p>President Trump, meanwhile, has outlined his own health strategy and a 'most-favoured-nation' plan to index certain drug prices against other countries. And while the latter idea has been poorly received by pharma giants - with Pfizer's (US:PFE) boss labelling it \"radical\" and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) body calling it \"an irresponsible and unworkable policy\" - uncertainty prevails once more. Who knows how far the unpredictable president would actually follow through with his intentions?</p><p>Whatever happens, the health sector will continue to try to influence policy in America, in and out of election cycles. Last year alone, PhRMA spent $29.3m on lobbying activity. Time will tell whether such disbursement helps big pharma and Washington to compromise on the key issues at stake. HC</p><p>Banks/financial services As is now standard practice in a US presidential election cycle, Wall Street has spent more than any other sector to date. It is also backing Joe Biden. As of 21 September, individuals employed in the loosely defined finance, real estate and insurance sector have committed a total of $86.7m to the Democratic candidate, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive politics .</p><p>This support is reflected across the sector's two largest sub-groups. Donors from the world of hedge funds and private equity have so far coughed up $34.1m for Mr Biden's campaign, while individuals employed in securities and investment banking have put in $51.1m.</p><p>That compares with contributions to the Trump campaign of $5.8m and $10.5m, respectively, although these figures mask the $28.4m spent on support for Republican politicians including Mr Trump since 2019 by Stephen Schwarzmann, chief executive of the giant private equity group Blackstone and the largest single active Wall Street donor.</p><p>The disclosures may seem counterintuitive for a sector long associated with support for corporate tax breaks and deregulation. The view that finance tends to support any policy that is pro-market is also backed up by recent history. After Barack Obama pushed through legislation aimed at curbing the banking excesses that led to the global financial crisis, finance contributions to his re-election bid in 2012 slumped to $21.1m. Four years before, Wall Street had thrown its full weight behind the Democratic party, spending a then-record $78.3m - 21 per cent more than the Republicans .</p><p>sector's contributionto the Democrats' electoral push are now ahead of Republicans' for the first time since Mr Obama's inaugural victory, although Hillary Clinton's bid remains the single most Wall-Street-funded run to date.</p><p>The 2016 Democratic candidate, who served as New York senator from 2001 to 2009, received $117m from finance, insurance and real estate backers. By contrast, Trump - whose first term has brought corporate and high income tax cuts, as well as pushbacks on financial reform - received just $37.9m in 2016, in part because of a wide Republican nominee field. Judged purely on dollar campaign contributions, financiers' early preference had been for Jeb Bush.</p><p>In a similar sense, Wall Street's support for Mr Biden can partially be understood for who he is not. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, early contenders in the race for the Democratic nomination, were both expected to take more combative stances against finance and corporate America .</p><p>Then again, although financial regulation has fallen offthe election agenda, Biden does not appear the closest of allies to the industry. His fiscal proposals - including higher payroll taxes, a 28 per cent corporate tax rate and doubling levies on US companies' income on overseas intangible assets - could knock 8 per cent from earnings for the S&amp;P 500 Index, say analysts at UBS. sector's contributionthis year may be a clearer sign of individual political preference than naked selfinterest after a\". An</p><p>Oil and gas Joe Biden will not take oil and gas donations. In any case, his Green New Deal and plan to end drilling on federal land would have made him an unlikely target for fossil fuel cash.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump has proudly cut environmental restrictions, permitting hurdles and the Obama Clean Power Plan, ensuring much affection from the oil and gas industry .</p><p>Earlier in September, Bureau of Land Management documents uncovered by Accountable.US, a centre-left advocacy group, showed the administration had also cut royalties from some projects on federal land from 12.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in reaction to the oil price crash in March.</p><p>According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the oil and gas industry has donated $12.7m to the Trump campaign and groups supporting it, and less than $1m to the Biden campaign.</p><p>Mr Biden has positioned himself as a green alternative, jumping on board the Green New Deal launched by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey last year. The Democratic nominee said he would sign the US up to the Paris Agreement again, bring in a net zero carbon emissions by 2050 target, and put $1.7 trillion into green infrastructure in the next decade. Fossil fuel companies will be most concerned about how Mr Biden will pay for this: raising corporation taxes and cutting fossil fuel subsidies.</p><p>The industry is also worried about the plan to ban drilling on federal land. The American Petroleum Institute (API) said it would result in 350,000 jobs disappearing by 2022, with Texas seeing the biggest impact. The API even claims coal use will go up if gas supply falls from the policy and chip away at the country's energy independence.</p><p>The industry is not getting every single thing it wants from President Trump. In early September, he extended an Obama-era ban on drilling in waters offthe coast of Florida, according to the Associated Press. Mr Biden has also said he would ban offshore drilling.</p><p>This is a high stakes game for the oil and gas industry. Extractives companies could not have hoped for a better friend in the White House and will fight hard to keep him there. AH</p><p>Technology The tech sector has driven much of the US stock rally that President Trump has sooften celebrated on his Twitter (US:TWTR) account. But internet companies such as Twitter have also found themselves at the heart of the electoral discourse, as they grapple with fake news and hate speech on their platforms - as well as national security threats from foreign disinformation campaigns. With reports that bots had meddled with the outcome of the last election, companies such as Twitter, Facebook (US:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) have been forced to take action to protect the health of American democracy.</p><p>President Trump has a volatile relationship with the Big Tech group: Twitter even blocked some of his tweets earlier in the year, on the grounds that they \"glorified violence\". With Mark Zuckerberg identifying Silicon Valley as \"an extremely left-leaning place\", it is perhaps little wonder that the majority in the internet industry have chosen to back the ostensibly more liberal Mr Biden - with 97 per cent of $13m-worth of donations fed to the Democrats.</p><p>But this could be to their detriment. This past summer there has been much commotion on Capitol Hill about antitrust behaviour in the industry: the chief executives of Facebook, Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN) and Alphabet were all called to testify at a Congressional hearing in August. Democrats typically come down harder on antitrust issues than Republicans. Yet individuals at Amazon, the company with the second-largest market value in the group, have pumped $0.7m into Mr Biden's campaign, seven times the amount that they have contributed to Mr Trump's. Indeed, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has officially endorsed the ex-vice-president for the 2020 election.</p><p>And it's not just internet companies - Individual donations from Microsoft (US:MSFT) to the Biden campaign have surpassed $0.8m. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that Mr Biden has so far refrained from joining the call to break up Big Tech firms, saying it would be premature to make a judgement without a formal investigation. It seems that the industry is betting that Mr Biden will take his cue from the legacy of Mr Obama's more Silicon Valley-friendly approach. LA</p><p>Contested election A contested US election was the biggest investment worry for 2020 in a poll carried out by deVere Group. It was the most pressing concern for 72 per cent of respondents, with worries of a second wave of coronavirus trailing behind at just 18 per cent.</p><p>A contested election will take a while to clarify - complicated by coronavirus restrictions and the complex processes of mass postal voting. It will \"almost inevitably send the stock markets into a temporary tailspin - and this is weighing on investors' minds\", says deVere chief executive Nigel Green.</p><p>Current polls suggest that Mr Biden maintains the lead. For many, Mr Trump has been a divisive, and certainly volatile, president. But there has rarely been - if ever - a political leader that connects the success of the market so closely with the economic health of the nation. Yet many of the biggest sectors do not seem to be backing him. Still, it is worth remembering that big campaign budgets and favourable polls do not always create a clear path to the White House.

Fifty per cent of the population is under 20 years of age. Internet and smartphone penetration are high in the region. We are currently seeing faster fintech adoption in the region primarily driven by customer preference for digital services, access to capital, and public policy reforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt have already established government-backed regulatory sandbox programmes, to attract some of the best global start-ups. These programmes allow fintech companies to gain easier market entry to the region, expand and operate in a cost-effective manner. Success stories of the model include the Dubai International Financial Centre's FinTech Hive, ADGM's Plug and Play Accelerator and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA).</p><p>What do you see as the greatest challenges for banks in the payments space?</p><p>Blurring industry boundaries\u2014the entrance of the Big Tech and telecommunication companies, although at a relatively slow pace, have begun to redefine and reshape the banking sector. Companies like Google or Facebook do not plan on launching their own banks but are starting to position themselves as players in the traditional banking industry. Similarly, PayPal promotes the concept of how a user's line of credit has 'attractive' incentives\u2014eliminating the need for customers to approach commercial banks for loans.</p><p>Business model innovation\u2014the emergence of new operating and business models is one of the challenges facing retail banking. The dynamic nature of the sector means that the revenues or margins of organisations can decrease if they do not drive a transformation of processes and business functions. Among the main challenges related to the new formulas, banks must boost revenues from non-banking services, monetise the use of APIs and automate systems to save costs.</p><p>With innovation being a real disruptor in how the banking industry visualises the landscape, the consolidation of new banks, the state of the economy and geopolitics are all main factors that create both opportunities and obstacles to how banks address consumers and key players in the market. In parallel, the MENA's banking industry is much stronger and profitable than it has ever been, thriving again after the crisis of 2008.</p><p>The regulatory framework established in the UAE for both banks and financial institutions keeps us optimistic. As history tells us, challenges have often led to new inventions, new possibilities and improved experiences.</p><p>Framing these challenges, would you do things differently?</p><p>We have been a disruptor in the space for close to four decades now. Our business has been constantly evolving to cater to the continuously growing needs of the customers. In the context of the trends and challenges facing our industry, we have taken measures to future-proof our business. We can contribute to the existing government initiatives focused on enabling a fintech start-up environment through our programmes.</p><p>In parallel, we would also establish closer collaboration with key entrepreneurs and start-ups whose work will add-value to our business operations. From our perspective, we would support start-ups with mentorship and training. Collaboration is integral and we have capitalised on it to unlock significant potential by delivering seamless solutions for customers.</p><p>From a systems and structure standpoint, we are exploring ways of fostering and attracting exceptional talent that will be important to our business growth. Our strategy involves end-to-end ownership of the payments value chain across origination, processing and the last-mile distribution network. This approach promotes operating efficiencies which have a direct impact on customer and stakeholder experiences.</p><p>What kind of opportunities do you see in this market?</p><p>There are multiple opportunities within the fintech space. UAE tops the global smartphone penetration with over 73 per cent of phone users owning smartphones. Similarly, 77 per cent of the Saudi Arabian population own a smartphone. This presents a huge insight into the future of digital payments. Based on what we are already seeing in trends, we expect payments to seize to become standalone activities, and instead become embedded into the overall customer-journey or lifestyle experiences. This can already be seen at companies such as Uber.</p><p>We also see the MENA region moving beyond just digitisation to embrace progressive regulations around electronic payments, open banking, and artificial intelligence. The UAE for example created a Ministry of AI as a result.</p><p>The tech savvy central bank-led initiatives across the GCC have also been created to build a start-up ecosystem for the purpose of developing payments facilities in the region. Policies are in place to focus on creating innovations. Finally, there is a demand from consumers for personal finance management and wealth management from financial institutions.</p><p>How do you envision banking to be in the next 10 years?</p><p>There is a real shift being seen globally, especially in the MENA region, from demographic targeting to a more lifestyle one, hence reinforcing the old saying, \"The Customer is King\". The banking industry's staying power will lie in its ability to analyse their customer's traits, lifestyle choices, in addition to individual experiences, and ultimately re-think their business models accordingly.</p><p>Moreover, banks will need to delve deeper into advanced analytics and digital technologies to be able to anticipate customers' needs ahead of time. We are talking about studying vast amounts of large internal financial behavioural data sets, customer data, transactional data, and even social media data. Customer-centric relationships will be the norm, and that will need to be deeper, rather than transactional. Users and customers are demanding more from their banks to help manage their lives and not just their finances\u2014it is a different climate.</p><p>When it comes to customer service and loyalty programmes, banks are predicted to be exploring ways of delivering value-added services through engagement to ensure customers continue doing business with them. To deliver this, banks would most-likely overhaul traditional merchant relationships, and focus more on collaborations with the new tech players and start-ups.</p><p>The transformations would impact the talent pool in the industry. Recruiting new capabilities and ways of attracting the new era of professionals would be established. With a different world of banking, it's anticipated that we would have jobs that do not exist today but will be the norm tomorrow.</p><p>From my perspective, this is one of the most exciting times as we are at the centre of a huge movement and strategy shift in traditional services.</p><p>\"AS HISTORY TELLS US, CHALLENGES HAVE OFTEN LED TO NEW INVENTIONS, NEW POSSIBILITIES AND IMPROVED EXPERIENCES.\"</p><p>\u2014 Binay Shetty</p><p>\"USERS AND CUSTOMERS ARE DEMANDING MORE FROM THEIR BANKS TO HELP MANAGE THEIR LIVES AND NOT JUST THEIR FINANCES\u2014 IT IS A DIFFERENT CLIMATE.\"</p><p>\u2014 Binay Shetty</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANMID-156830617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANMID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-V2V1-JDJN-61V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1234\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CPI Financial.

Google\u2019s venture into digital checking and savings accounts has enlisted Citi and a number of smaller players, such as BBVA and BMO Harris. Apple\u2019s has stepped into consumer credit on the arm of Goldman Sachs, and Amazon is expanding from its commercial lending base into consumer lending with everyday cards issued by Chase and Synchrony. For incumbent financial services players, the convergence of these industries holds real promise but also poses significant strategic risks.    Let\u2019s start with the promise. Partnerships with Big Tech grant financial services firms access to huge numbers of potential new customers. Amazon has 112 million Prime members and 2 million Marketplace sellers worldwide. Google has 39 million Google Pay users, and in a survey, 16% of Millennials and 13% of Gen X-ers said that they would make a Google checking account their primary account. These are not just cold leads; tech companies know when customers are planning a holiday, shipping kids off to school, or thinking about buying a home. They have the ability to propose the right product to the right person at the right time.         Big Tech partnerships also promise banks access to torrents of data, new capabilities, and cutting-edge technology. The data that Big Tech holds on customers, their interactions, and their transactions, can transform essential bank operations, such as credit decisioning, pricing insurance policies, or regulatory compliance. And Big Tech brings remarkable capability to the party, such as cloud services, analytics, security solutions, and disaster recovery. Further, Big Tech\u2019s ability to invest and develop these technologies dwarfs that  of incumbent banks; a tie-up provides cost-effective access to the latest kit.    Finally, a partnership with Big Tech offers banks\u2019 brands a shot in the arm. Even before the 2008 financial crisis, banks\u2019 reputations were in decline; since then, reputational recovery has been slow. To reverse the damage and step up their brand game, Incumbent banks could leverage lessons in customer experience from a big tech partner.    Each of these benefits come with a corresponding risk and incumbent banks ignore them (wilfully or otherwise) at their peril.    The great cut-in  Big Tech is far more likely to end up owning the customer relationship than its financial services partners. Google\u2019s digital checking account would see the company provide the front-end, customer experience, and mine financial insights as the backbone of personalised advice. This is not just Big Tech playing to its strengths, owning and controlling the customer experience is central to their platform business models.    Matt Locsin    Most banks still think of themselves as having a direct and meaningful relationship with their customers; it is the basis upon which they offer prudent advice and personalised service. Indeed, many depend on it as a means to cross-sell products and maximise lifetime customer value. Further, if a Big Tech partner were to develop aggregation or payment initiation services, this could further weaken banks\u2019 stability and lead to an increased cost of funds. If banks are not careful, they could find themselves becoming the anonymous financial plumbing of e-commerce, mobility, media, and other industries.    Keeping up with the GAFAs  Though Big Tech can grant incumbent banks access to new data, capability, and technology, banks need to be able to use these things effectively in order to keep pace with their partners. As noted, customer experience matters, and Big Tech is not likely to tolerate any risk of disruption or increasing friction from the operational deficiencies of their partners. If credit decisions are not snappy, account opening isn\u2019t a breeze, or if payments take too long to settle, would-be partners are likely to be binned.    Friend today, competitor tomorrow    Some of Big Tech\u2019s moves into financial services, beyond partnerships, are outright competitive, targeting lucrative financial product categories or launching products central to Big Tech\u2019s core businesses. These moves started years ago with payments, where e-commerce players created products to facilitate trust between sellers and buyers online. The use of mobile payments has grown briskly since. In China, mobile payments account for 16% of GDP, thanks to players like Alibaba\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s Tenpay.    Amazon has steadily moved into financial products necessary to increase users and transactions on its core platform. Payments are a given (Amazon Pay) but it also offers credit through Amazon Lending and insurance (Amazon Protect). And Uber and Lyft are fighting to attract and retain drivers with mobile payments, bank accounts, and credit  \u2014products that make working with these ride-hailing giants ostensibly easier.    Few observers or analysts believe that Big Tech wants to subsume banking outright. The cost of compliance and the complexity of operating in a regulated industry are enough of a turn-off. But there is little to stop Big Tech from cherry-picking the products and services that matter to them or their customers. Indeed, the rise of Banking-As-A-Service is making the aggregation of essential infrastructure remarkably easy. So, where banks and technology companies today find common cause, could become tomorrow\u2019s battlegrounds.    Whether to partner with Big Tech and how are serious decisions for leaders of incumbent banks. With the benefits of doing so immediately clear, many big banks have already jumped in. But beneath the surface lie a number of rocky issues. If banks can navigate the risks, it could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43125377037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WK-X9V1-F07F-84BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>FinanceDigest.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0UyODlCRjcwOUUyNDQ4RThEQ0ZGQTM0NUYzOTgyRUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBODUyMzhBNzc4NDZDNEE4RjRCRUQ2QzJDMDg2QjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The industry in the UK will continue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">to grow at 3.6pc\u00a0a year</url>, driven by a combination of demographic factors such as the growing number of middle-class consumers in India and China, increasing globalisation of trade and finance and the rapid development of digital banking and mobile wallets.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, though, fees on those payments are coming down rapidly. Changing expectations from customers, tougher regulation and improved technology within banks have all played a part in making payments faster, cheaper and more accessible.\u00a0</p><p>From a customer perspective all this is welcome, but the profound change in payments is not over yet. Customers expect more from their banks, and if they don't get it, there's a risk that others could step in to take over.</p><p>Fintechs and social media giants are nipping at the heels of the banks, but so far they have only made limited inroads.</p><p>Newcomers like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">Transferwise</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">Revolut</url> are making dents in international payments and currency exchange. In between are thousands of operators targeting different parts of the payments business. Despite these efforts, the newcomers haven't crashed the barriers. In 2019 non-banks carried out just 8.1PC\u00a0of global payment revenues.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">Read More | Revolut's rise</url></p><p>The UK is at the centre of this upheaval. Fintech investment here is growing at a high rate, and our regulators have led the way in building faster, more efficient payment systems to promote competition and innovation. Customers in the UK have been among the first to enjoy instant, invisible and free payments.</p><p>For our banks there is a very real threat of being left behind in this brave new world. At worst, they could face disintermediation, being cut off from consumers by a third party. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">Starbucks app</url>, for instance, integrates payments as part of a wider proposition in which the barrista knows the customer's name and their favourite drink. The bank, on the other hand, has all but disappeared from the process and no longer has access to any information other than the top-up of the app.\u00a0</p><p>If banks allow themselves to become purely transactional in this way, they will end up handling only the low-margin, high-volume commodity payments. Given how slim margins are likely to become, this is a route open only to the biggest and most efficient of operators.</p><p>But there is nothing inevitable about this outcome. If the banks can fight technology with technology, there is no reason they can't use the power of the data they now own to innovate and offer customers more valuable services.</p><p>In order to avoid being pushed out of their own back garden, the banks need to do two things, preferably at the same time. They need to develop scale - become huge, efficient payment machines - and they need to differentiate themselves in the minds of their customers.</p><p>Consolidation within the industry is already underway, both among the banks and fintechs. In the UK, Virgin Money has merged with CYGB, owner of Clydesdale Bank, while in the US, FIS and Worldpay announced a $43bn\u00a0merger earlier this year. M&amp;A has a continuing part to play in building scale and improving efficiency, but technology is equally critical in creating low-cost systems that can handle huge volumes of transactions in real time or close to it.</p><p>However, being big and efficient won't, on its own, be enough for banks to flourish. They also need to innovate and offer customers improvements they didn't even know they needed. Some will be about anticipating customers' needs, such as PayPal offering credit provision at the point of sale, enabling customers to borrow for their purchase. Others will be in streamlining existing services, such as Santander using blockchain technology to deliver low-cost, cross-border payments.</p><p>The delay to SCA regulation provides the banks with an obvious opportunity to put their innovation skills to good use. It allows time to develop new ways of improving payment security that don't require customers to remember new pin codes or byzantine passwords.</p><p>Facial recognition technology is improving fast and customers have become used to using their thumbprint as security on mobile devices. Banks will need to innovate, and quickly, or impatient millennial customers will find different ways to make their payments rather than wade through layers of security to buy their coffee.</p><p>Even with open banking and the introduction of a seven-day switching process for bank accounts, banks have so far held on to the vast proportion of their customers. The long-standing trust we have for our banks and caution about newly spawned fintech companies have both contributed to customer inertia.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/business-reporter/iovation-and-psd2/\">Business Briefing Newsletter REFERRAL (Article)</url></p><p>That reluctance to switch will not stay in place forever, though, and younger customers are far more likely to embrace change. So far, social media companies and Big Tech payments haven't made a full-frontal assault on the UK banks.</p><p>But, given their high number of existing customers on which they have large amounts of data, they are in a strong position to take the next step.

Banks and other financial organizations are using machine learning to automate call centers, make personalized financial recommendations through mobile apps and identify financial fraud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, banks are at a disadvantage relative to other industries in three interrelated areas: the hiring of talent, the efficient development and deployment of advanced analytics and compliance with regulatory expectations. Without talent, it is difficult to create the appropriate analytics to better serve bank customers. Banks are competing for talent with Netflix, Google, Facebook and Uber, among others. Aside from the cachet of working for a big tech firm, top talent will want to work in the fast-paced environment of a modern company rather than at a legacy institution. Banks also suffer from an aging technology infrastructure. Technology is improving at an increasing rate, and most banks' infrastructure is ill-equipped for rapid implementation.</p><p>Banks are also at a disadvantage due to the length of time it takes to develop and deploy models. Banks are familiar with the semiannual cadence of regulatory stress tests. The processes around models including governance, controls, validation and promoting models to production were created to align with this six-month schedule. Developing, testing and validating models often takes months at banks. These model activities typically occur sequentially rather than in parallel, further increasing the time to market. In contrast, Netflix software to productionthousands of times a day.</p><p>One of the reasons that banks are slow to develop and deploy models is due to heightened regulatory expectations around model development and independent model review. In some cases, large regional banks' primary introduction to modeling was through the regulatory CCAR and DFAST stress test exercises. Soon after the CCAR and DFAST models were introduced, the Federal Reserve prescribed additional requirements for independent model validation. Some banks scrambled to comply with the new modeling requirements, resulting in suboptimal workflows around model development and validation.</p><p>The good news is there's a solution to these disadvantages: Banks need to create a framework or ecosystem for efficient and compliant model development and validation. Such an ecosystem is necessary to compete in the new world of big data and analytics while satisfying the needs of customers, developers and regulators. Such an ecosystem must allow for the efficient deployment of high-value analytics while still retaining the governance and controls expected of a financial institution. To achieve this goal, the ecosystem must deliver on a number of fronts.</p><p>The model development environment is vital for attracting and retaining quantitative talent. The environment should support familiar and popular development platforms such as Jupyter notebooks or markdown. The environment should support a wide variety of programming languages so that developers can use their favorite libraries. The environment should integrate with enterprise source control management systems such as source control management for code and model versioning. Frequently, developers will iterate on models and discard models that do not perform adequately. These alternative designs provide key developmental evidence and should be archived. The environment should automatically archive these artifacts for use by other model developers, model validators, internal auditors and others. Finally, the environment should allow for every model and its dependencies to be delivered in a self-contained package.</p><p>A challenge for many developers at banks is the deployment of a trained model into production. The environment should enable simple one-click deployment of the model into a test or quality assurance environment for model consumers to assess. Efficient deployment to a quality assurance environment is vital for obtaining fast feedback and for allowing developers to iterate on models to meet model consumers' needs. For a move to production, the environment should integrate with the enterprise software delivery system pipelines. Such pipelines allow model developers, model validators and IT to create tests that run automatically on every model change. Rather than wait weeks for technology and risk to be comfortable with a change, the technology and risk requirements can be built into the deployment pipeline. The environment should also support various types of deployment strategies such as A/B testing so that model performance can be tracked against alternative processes.</p><p>Once in production, models must be monitored for performance. Such monitoring should be automated to the extent possible. The environment should support monitoring the distribution of model inputs to ensure that the data that the model is scoring is similar to the data that the model was trained on. The environment should support triggers or alerts when performance becomes unacceptable, including automated emails or texts to key stakeholders in technology and risk divisions. The environment should support custom performance criteria. For example, for loan origination models, one criterion may be a metric that tracks the percentage of loan approvals by ZIP code to ensure compliance with fair banking laws.</p><p>Finally, the model environment should support governance by supplying model metadata such as a model inventory, documentation archiving and reporting. The model inventory should automatically track the downstream impacts of poor model performance. When a platform that developers actually want to use is provided, the inventory is likely to be more complete than traditional model inventories. The platform's inventory helps model consumers and developers explore the universe of models. This reduces the amount of duplicate efforts around models. This inventory also encourages a healthy competition around model performance. Model developers can transparently compete to create higher-performing models.</p><p>Financial institutions must be innovative to meet the needs and expectations of their customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-39d6-d939-ad7d-7ff61b6a0000-42</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ6-F3C1-JCRW-52VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

Banks and other financial organizations are using machine learning to automate call centers, make personalized financial recommendations through mobile apps and identify financial fraud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, banks are at a disadvantage relative to other industries in three interrelated areas: the hiring of talent, the efficient development and deployment of advanced analytics and compliance with regulatory expectations. Without talent, it is difficult to create the appropriate analytics to better serve bank customers. Banks are competing for talent with Netflix, Google, Facebook and Uber, among others. Aside from the cachet of working for a big tech firm, top talent will want to work in the fast-paced environment of a modern company rather than at a legacy institution. Banks also suffer from an aging technology infrastructure. Technology is improving at an increasing rate, and most banks' infrastructure is ill-equipped for rapid implementation.</p><p>Banks are also at a disadvantage due to the length of time it takes to develop and deploy models. Banks are familiar with the semiannual cadence of regulatory stress tests. The processes around models including governance, controls, validation and promoting models to production were created to align with this six-month schedule. Developing, testing and validating models often takes months at banks. These model activities typically occur sequentially rather than in parallel, further increasing the time to market. In contrast, Netflix software to productionthousands of times a day.</p><p>One of the reasons that banks are slow to develop and deploy models is due to heightened regulatory expectations around model development and independent model review. In some cases, large regional banks' primary introduction to modeling was through the regulatory CCAR and DFAST stress test exercises. Soon after the CCAR and DFAST models were introduced, the Federal Reserve prescribed additional requirements for independent model validation. Some banks scrambled to comply with the new modeling requirements, resulting in suboptimal workflows around model development and validation.</p><p>The good news is there's a solution to these disadvantages: Banks need to create a framework or ecosystem for efficient and compliant model development and validation. Such an ecosystem is necessary to compete in the new world of big data and analytics while satisfying the needs of customers, developers and regulators. Such an ecosystem must allow for the efficient deployment of high-value analytics while still retaining the governance and controls expected of a financial institution. To achieve this goal, the ecosystem must deliver on a number of fronts.</p><p>The model development environment is vital for attracting and retaining quantitative talent. The environment should support familiar and popular development platforms such as Jupyter notebooks or markdown. The environment should support a wide variety of programming languages so that developers can use their favorite libraries. The environment should integrate with enterprise source control management systems such as source control management for code and model versioning. Frequently, developers will iterate on models and discard models that do not perform adequately. These alternative designs provide key developmental evidence and should be archived. The environment should automatically archive these artifacts for use by other model developers, model validators, internal auditors and others. Finally, the environment should allow for every model and its dependencies to be delivered in a self-contained package.</p><p>A challenge for many developers at banks is the deployment of a trained model into production. The environment should enable simple one-click deployment of the model into a test or quality assurance environment for model consumers to assess. Efficient deployment to a quality assurance environment is vital for obtaining fast feedback and for allowing developers to iterate on models to meet model consumers' needs. For a move to production, the environment should integrate with the enterprise software delivery system pipelines. Such pipelines allow model developers, model validators and IT to create tests that run automatically on every model change. Rather than wait weeks for technology and risk to be comfortable with a change, the technology and risk requirements can be built into the deployment pipeline. The environment should also support various types of deployment strategies such as A/B testing so that model performance can be tracked against alternative processes.</p><p>Once in production, models must be monitored for performance. Such monitoring should be automated to the extent possible. The environment should support monitoring the distribution of model inputs to ensure that the data that the model is scoring is similar to the data that the model was trained on. The environment should support triggers or alerts when performance becomes unacceptable, including automated emails or texts to key stakeholders in technology and risk divisions. The environment should support custom performance criteria. For example, for loan origination models, one criterion may be a metric that tracks the percentage of loan approvals by ZIP code to ensure compliance with fair banking laws.</p><p>Finally, the model environment should support governance by supplying model metadata such as a model inventory, documentation archiving and reporting. The model inventory should automatically track the downstream impacts of poor model performance. When a platform that developers actually want to use is provided, the inventory is likely to be more complete than traditional model inventories. The platform's inventory helps model consumers and developers explore the universe of models. This reduces the amount of duplicate efforts around models. This inventory also encourages a healthy competition around model performance. Model developers can transparently compete to create higher-performing models.</p><p>Financial institutions must be innovative to meet the needs and expectations of their customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-39d6-d939-ad7d-7ff61b6a0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ3-DS91-F06X-W29N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

In disruptive times like these, customer loyalty is particularly brittle, and ironically crucial to the survival of many organizations. Banks are no exception.  To thrive and grow, banks must identify how they can be more customer-centric, offer enhanced transparency, deliver customized capabilities and maximize their assets to showcase their value across each step of the customer journey. This new way of thinking for many banks will require them to reimagine their core technology, foster strong partner networks and understand the true meaning of digital transformation, all while placing empathy and agility at the heart of their strategy.  Despite the new difficulties banks face, the current pandemic can also serve as a catalyst to accelerate long-overdue initiatives, according to new research by (BCG). Financial institutions are uniquely positioned to adapt and optimize their existing assets to achieve customer remediation. They already retain detailed intelligence on their customers, have established methods to interact with them, and can aggregate and analyze data to offer a superior customer experience. Banks that emerge stronger from this pandemic will be those that move towards a model that enables them to deliver on customers\u2019 expectations through technology innovation that also helps them to control costs and differentiate themselves from competitors.  Customization is king  As the lines between what traditional banks and fintechs can offer customers continue to blur, the way banks develop, deliver and improve hyper-personalized customer experiences will define who gains and retains customers in a COVID-19 shaped world.  Big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon have successfully crossed into the financial services market and changed the game for incumbent players. Their business models are built on customization, prioritizing user experience and the customer journey to maintain their existing customer base and grab increasing market share from traditional players. These tech companies understand how to leverage customer data to provide the ultimate personalized experience and use it to suggest \u2013 and even predict \u2013 the customer journey, setting the standard for consumer expectations. The sheer power, size and reach of these companies has left many traditional participants unable to compete. With a daily presence in consumers\u2019 lives combined with significant capital, existing customer data and strong brand loyalty, big tech and fintechs have become the drivers of innovation \u2013 and have pressured traditional banks to rethink how they can focus on customer-centricity and strive to own the customer value chain.  Challenger banks and fintech providers have enjoyed a high level of trust among customers due to their service-first models that build consumer confidence and encourage loyalty. As traditional banks struggle to retain existing customers, they are also losing out on valuable insights that could help them attract new customers, especially millennials, and offer them a transparent and customized experience vs. merely a product.  Millennial needs are influenced by two key factors. One, millennials grew up on the technology of today. A smartphone is their very own personal life assistant used to shop, entertain themselves, learn, work and manage their financial health. Banks need to take this almost fundamental reliance on technology into account when designing new services that resonate with the unique needs of millennials. Two, banks must also recognize the employment and income stability that traditionally affects this generation, something which has been made even more insecure because of COVID-19 and the knock-on economic effects. As the banking experience evolves from product-based to customer-based, financial institutions will be pressed to find new ways to deliver the hyper-personalization services that customers, especially younger people, expect.  Pandemic pressures mount  Banks must be able to quickly adapt to changing goalposts, new customer requirements and continued disruption. The market volatility resulting from the pandemic has taught us that the only thing the banking industry can be certain of in this environment is more uncertainty.  This will require banks to recast their strategies, roadmaps and budgets so they can respond to today\u2019s challenges, prepare for future business disruptions and ensure they retain existing customers while appealing to new targets. Now is the time for them to modernize their legacy technology systems, enable end-to-end agility and focus on flexibility, scale, and speed to accelerate their digital transformation and excel in a competitive and turbulent landscape.  Leveraging a modular approach and smart partners  Banks recognize they need to take a modular approach to digital transformation and balance their focus between user friendly front-end channels such as mobile, app and web, and critical yet less flashy middle and back-end systems. While there are many options to modernize legacy banking systems, simplifying complex operations and infrastructure should be step one and represents a low risk method to start the digital transformation journey.  Banks can avoid having to replace their stable core systems by embracing intelligent technology and partners to create the right service bundles for their customers. Adopting a digital core, \u2018hollowing out\u2019 customer engagement functions from the core system and managing it as a horizontal cross-enterprise layer will reap multiple benefits to banks. It will enable them to enhance product innovation, deploy sophisticated customer data management, expand their partner ecosystem and improve revenue management and pricing.  By leveraging their existing robust infrastructure rather than overhauling their entire systems, and utilizing technology partnerships that provide economies of scale, banks can cleverly ensure the agility, flexibility and budget required to make their digital transformation plans a success. This approach will enable banks to quickly adopt new technologies, add functionality and capabilities, enhance the user experience and provide customized internal and external products and integrated services\u2013 all while maintaining ownership of the complete customer relationship.  Financial customer data in high demand  Undoubtedly, the entry of fintechs and bigtechs has changed the way the industry views and uses data. This has created privacy concerns and anxiety around confidential customer data as high-profile data breaches make the news and push regulators to play an increasingly prominent role.  Banks and financial institutions have a surplus of customer data from individual accounts and insight into how the individual or household spends and saves. The ability to maintain access to that data is so valuable that fintechs and data aggregators have been particularly eager to get more access to sensitive data, as responsible handlers. This \u2018battle\u2019 over information has escalated in the absence of clear rules and lack of bank regulators\u2019 ability to oversee aggregators as they usually don\u2019t have direct relationships with those banks.  Banks have the responsibility to safeguard their customers\u2019 data and leverage it to build the empathetic bank of the future. That bank will help protect customers from fraudulent behavior, cybercriminals and illegitimate financial activity that could occur if customer data ends up in the wrong hands. As the main \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of financial customer data, banks are also tasked with making smart use of their data to uncover the context behind banking transactions, understand their customers\u2019 ultimate goals and add value to every interaction. Data has the power to enable empathetic banking and help humanize the banking experience \u2013 a true competitive differentiator.  At the centre: empathy and agility  Banks must strive to keep empathy and agility at the centre of their strategies to best serve the customer of tomorrow. That means embracing customer data to ensure their offerings add real value to the customer journey. By creating and maintaining access to consolidated data, banks can quickly respond to consumers\u2019 evolving needs and seamlessly access this data by building a digital core layer in their functionality, which captures and meticulously logs the data from every customer interaction, personal information, purchasing pattern and more.  Smart banks will leverage their customers\u2019 information to offer service-first models built on trust and loyalty, while ensuring transparency for both customers and potential regulatory requirements. The bank model of the future is rooted in empathy, understands the customer\u2019s needs, drives customer retention and ensures the long-term health of their business.

This has been recognized by the authorities, who have revealed the interest of some of them to enter. </p><p><br/> The banks are also aware of this. While some suggest that they can compete for you for you as one more player; others point out that the ideal is to ally. What all those who operate in Mexico, or at least the largest ones, do coincide is that the same regulation should apply to the same activity. <br/> Eduardo Osuna Osuna, vice president and director of BBVABancomer, mentioned a few weeks ago to El Economista that any increase in competition is good for the system, as it is more innovative, but he recognized that it represents a risk. <br/> \"The great challenge with these new participants in the system is that with equal products and risks, we have the same regulation so as not to generate asymmetries between some players and others. And above all, that this regulation protects the saving public (...) Always a competitor is a risk, it is a threat in any industry. The challenge is to move at the same pace as a competitor or faster than him, otherwise you are doomed to lose market. And we have been preparing to compete just for you with the global players, \"he said. <br/>BBVABancomer is one of the banks that has shown the most progress in the digitization of its banking and in providing products and services to its customers. Other banks of the largest have also moved in that direction. <br/> For Hector Grisi Checa, executive president and director of Santander Mexico, the main thing in this issue is that all operate under the same ground, same conditions and same requirements. <br/> \"We can compete against anyone, but in the same conditions. The regulation has to be the same, they have to have the same requirements that we have for everything we do, \"he said in a recent interview. <br/> He added: \"I do not know (if they will arrive soon), but that they will arrive will arrive, and what is important is that the regulation is ready to receive them and to put us all in the same territory.\" <br/> Enrique Zorrilla Fullaondo, CEO of Scotiabank Mexico, recently acknowledged that the great technology companies are big competitors and have emphasized something that the bank did not necessarily put in place before, which is the customer experience. <br/> He agreed with his colleagues: \"It is very important that the regulation be equal and equivalent so that we all have the same requirements for information, authentication and binding controls with that clientele. Otherwise, what we would be seeing would be an arbitration in favor of these entities, clearly up to now not regulated in a high percentage of their activities or regulated in a very different way \". <br/> Work together? <br/> Ernesto Torres Cant\u00fa, general director of Citibanamex, has a vision in a different point, since he affirmed a few weeks ago that the best way is to work together. <br/> \"And we have done it, to show the Good End. The promotions we had with Amazon, with Apple, were very good by far, we were the best bank in that and with very close associations. So, that model of collaboration, I think that is what will end up subsisting, \"he said. <br/> Recently, the president of the National Banking and Securities Commission, Adalberto Palma, acknowledged that there is interest from companiesall types of technology, including GAFA, to operate in Mexico with financial services. <br/> Although banks have a lot of information from their customers, until recently they had not taken advantage of this situation, using artificial intelligence, big data and other tools, to give a better experience to their customers, something that is in the DNA of large companies. technological <br/> They already operate in some jurisdictions <br/> The Fintech study and Market Structure in Financial Services: Market Developments and Possible Implications for Financial Stability, prepared by the Financial Stability Board, points out that in some jurisdictions large well-established technology companies have recently entered the financial services markets. <br/> As an example, he mentions that the big tech Chinese firms Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are active in a wide range of financial services, and in many cases they are associated with the main financial institutions or new fintech players. <br/> \"In the United States, Amazon loans, launched in 2011, are offered to merchants who sell products through its market (...) Recently it started a partnership with Bank of America in loans for small businesses and, reportedly , is in talks with banks about a current account product, \"the report says. <br/> He adds that in Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom, PayPal's working capital is also increasing loans to companies: \"In East Africa, Egypt and India, Vodafone M-Pesa reports that it has 32 million active users in payments, and in Kenya it offers credit products and deposits through M-Shwari. In Latin America, the Mercado Libre e-commerce platform had lent $ 127 million in several markets at the end of 2017, and is experimenting with insurance products and asset management. \" <br/> The document states that big tech companies can have access to state-of-the-art technologies to process big data, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, \"therefore, they can enjoy some competitive advantages over companies. of financial services. \" <br/> Collaboration banks-fintech, fundamental to compete <br/> A recent article by the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, called The Future of Banking: Technology and Innovation Could Expand Access to Banking Services in Mexico, points out that in other regions such as the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific, the GAFA have already penetration of the banking space in a limited way, mainly through the payment service. <br/> Currently, he says, Amazon is evaluating the possibility of adopting the CoDi so that its Mexican customers can pay using scanning technology with QR codes. <br/> Therefore, in the opinion of S &amp; P, future collaboration between Mexican commercial banks and fintech companies will be fundamental to compete with technology titans that have a strong financial strength and stronger client bases. <br/> [email protected] <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-6618147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWM-6CV1-JCMP-5555-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000CECO</classCode><className>GRUPO FINANCIERO SANTANDER MEXICO SAB DE CV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XQV</classCode><className>BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Companies are always looking for ways to expand their offerings and evolve their business through disrupting incumbents. Big Tech is always focused on further monetizing their data relationships with customers, and banking is the next frontier after retail, media and travel.</p><p>The real question is, how will Big Tech manage the regulatory piece of what's required? How do banks who are sitting on this mound of data make better use of it to retain relationships? Right now, banks still have the edge, and they also have the trust factor that comes with being a bank due to regulation.</p><p>But banks need to master data in order to hold this lead, build a collaborative ecosystem to take up and deploy innovation faster, and drive experience as a critical principle in product innovation - all these are done by Big Techs and fintechs very well in the current business models.</p><p>We hear so much about legacy technology holding back bank innovation. Are we at a point where tech stacks are no longer capable of being upgraded?</p><p>Definitely. Banks today are struggling to replace their tech stacks as they are now incredibly complex, due to years of piecemeal software development on antiquated platforms. This is further complicated by the fact that software programming talent developing and managing these platforms are out of the workforce and difficult to find. Also, the emergence of social, mobile-centric thinking in product design and mainstreaming of big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence as core principles in banking platforms make it more difficult for banks to survive on these platforms.</p><p>While a rip-and-replace model with a long-drawn-out transformation program is becoming less of an option, we see a progressive approach could work. As with today's componentized, open, and microservices-based architecture and movement toward the cloud, banks can undertake a fast outcome-driven transformation of their tech stacks and core banking platforms. With this approach, banks can choose the business area they want to transform, either based on revenue and profitability priorities, or new business models they want to bring, such as digital banking.</p><p>Prime examples from our customer base are Westpac in Australia, which is undertaking a homeownership-lending-focused transformation, and KeyBank in the U.S., which has undertaken a transformation of its digital experience followed by a personal lending transformation.</p><p>Alternative core providers are breaking into the U.S. market from Europe. There are banking industry firms investing in core provider startups. We've heard a lot of unhappiness among smaller financial institutions about their service. Can you discuss how the core banking industry can address this issue?</p><p>Core banking is a mission-critical application, and it requires robust product development, testing and implementation methodology to be successful. While like any other industry where new and disruptive thinking is welcome, banks need to choose their core banking technology partner based on R&amp;D investment that the partner brings to the table currently and for future product innovation.</p><p>Customers in financial services are demanding high-touch service on-demand, especially for certain important transactions like investments. Can financial institutions do both in a digital-first environment?</p><p>It is possible to do both, but a bank has to prioritize where it wants to deliver high-touch, on-demand services on its own versus segments where it can leverage technology innovation to deliver more high-volume but less personalized services.</p><p>A broad rule could be to keep high-revenue-generating, high-profitability areas within the bank and its owned channels, such as relationship management for high-net-worth wealth management. For more volume-driven opportunities such as the mass-affluent segment, it could deploy a robo-advisory capability or even externalize its system through open application programming interfaces and use third-party fintech innovation.</p><p>However, automation and a data-driven approach is needed for both, but segmentation will help retain and acquire customers at the same time while driving profitability.</p><p>Many executives talk about horizontal roles and breaking down silos when it comes to data sharing and use. What is the reality for institutions to achieve this? What's worked best to ensure this collaboration takes form?</p><p>Banks need to take a foundational approach to how they turn data into an asset to use across functions. A core investment toward this is a common data model and analytical applications that source, curate and transform data for risk and finance data from multiple sources into a common standard for use across functions for insight and action.</p><p>With this approach, data can be used not only for specific immediate purposes like regulatory reporting and risk, but also reused to analyze profitability and decide next-best action by different offices within the bank's chief financial, marketing, compliance and revenue, cutting across silos.</p><p>A recent Accenture report suggested over 50% of bank staff roles can be automated. What are some of the emerging tools that Oracle sees playing a role in that transformation?</p><p>There are a number of emerging tools, we see. First among them is the broad set of machine learning and robotic process automation tools. For example, within financial compliance, automation is a way to make your staff more productive. Banks can use machine learning and robotic process automation to fetch reports from disparate sources, reducing false positives in transaction monitoring, giving anti-money-laundering investigators more time to focus on analysis instead of gathering data information. Interestingly, we are seeing that banks are using this to increase the overall effectiveness of their compliance departments at lower costs.</p><p>One digital-advice firm at our recent event said it will roll out the ability for its users to get a one-click mortgage. They are building these capabilities from scratch. Can banks match this? The CEO said that the best engineers don't want to work at banks.</p><p>There is a popular view that banks are technology companies with a banking license, and it could be true for large banks like JPMorgan, BBVA and Citi.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016f-8568-df3b-a9ef-87e8dde30000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-7R61-F06X-W3JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1276\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

These large companies would include banks, telcos, and Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The benefit of economies of scale applies not only to decreasing fixed costs from technology spending, but also higher efficiency in handling cash, which remains prevalent in emerging markets.</p><p>The McKinsey study showed that a mobile banking business in emerging markets can hit a 35 per cent margin once it reaches optimal scale. But the significant upfront spending means that small firms may need to spend as much as two times more on each customer to reach that scale.</p><p>A breakeven point for mobile banking in emerging markets is estimated by McKinsey to be about US$20 million in revenue, with annual transaction value hitting some US$2 billion.</p><p>To be sure, this breakeven figure would not apply to all emerging markets. McKinsey noted that much of its focus was on numbers from East Africa, though it had also included representatives from South-east Asia.</p><p>In cash-based economies, customers must be able to efficiently deposit and withdraw cash into and from their payment accounts. Many mobile banking players rely on agency networks - either hiring third-party sales representatives, or drawing on an existing retail network - to ensure that customers can get access to cash, or deposit funds.</p><p>Here is where economies of scale power up the engine. Mobile banking providers stand to improve profitability \"meaningfully\" by increasing the number of digital transactions each time cash is put into the system, McKinsey said.</p><p>Margins on transactions can exceed 75 per cent, as fees are large compared to the low costs to the provider, which are using automated systems and digital user interfaces.</p><p>\"All evidence indicates that cash will not disappear anytime soon. Even in Norway, for example, the country with the largest share of digital payments globally, 17 per cent of all payments are transacted in cash,\" the report said.</p><p>\"To improve profits, providers should look to grow digital transactions even if it means also increasing the number of cash-in-cash-out transactions.\"</p><p>As margins on cash deposits and withdrawal alone are lower - at about 20 per cent to 30 per cent - even small cost reductions can impact overall economics. Conversely, such cost jumps can turn players unprofitable.</p><p>There are more conventional pieces of evidence that big is still beautiful when it comes to mobile banking in emerging markets.</p><p>What's key is IT spending, which represents about US$1.5 million in annual fixed cost for a mobile banking system. Again, that spending is significant for small providers, but is minimal for large players.</p><p>But beyond IT costs, there are also the costs of real estate, and marketing, with marketing expenses alone about 40 per cent higher for subscale mobile-banking providers, compared to providers operating at scale, estimated McKinsey.</p><p>This means financial companies looking to expand into emerging markets through mobile banking would need financial stamina.</p><p>\"To gain the benefits of scale, providers must invest heavily and with long time horizons,\" McKinsey said. \"This holds true across the world for Internet players in network businesses - firms such as Alibaba and Google have invested significantly in long-term growth and market capture, even when this means immediate losses.\"</p><p>Much of the focus on financial inclusion has been on lifting people out of poverty by introducing them to financial services. McKinsey noted the same, saying that mobile banking can be a lifeline.</p><p>\"It brings the benefits of financial services to those who currently lack access, and thus enables them to take initial steps towards healthier financial lives.\"</p><p>But regulatory changes meant to spur inclusion can significantly shift the business dynamics of mobile banking players. For example, caps on fees can make the mobile banking business an unsustainable endeavour, particularly for smaller firms. So while such caps are intended to make services affordable to poorer users, they hinder profitability and make growing the customer base more difficult, said McKinsey.</p><p>\"Even when tariff caps do not make a type of transaction unprofitable, they increase the transaction value required through the system for a provider to be profitable overall,\" McKinsey added.</p><p>\"They may also make some customer segments unappealing for providers to serve, if the expense to reach them outweighs the benefit from gaining more users.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>There is a viable business for financial firms which want to expand into emerging markets through the use of mobile banking, a fresh McKinsey study on Tuesday suggested.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-195597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVM-6WS1-JCF2-853V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001514</classCode><className>SALES FORCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GR138</classCode><className>SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

This is facilitating the emergence of new, technology-driven competitors to banks that could potentially affect their dominant position in the financial system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A second is the impact of tighter regulation on banks. A third is expectations for banks' obligations to the community.</p><p>A substantial influence on banking at the moment is the rapid pace of technological change. We are seeing a massive increase in the availability of data. This could erode, or maybe even eradicate, banks' historical advantage in credit risk assessment.</p><p>There are two parts to this: regulatory changes mean that banks' private customer data can be made available to others and, second, that non-banks have some data that is useful for banking business.</p><p>The first part is the Consumer Data Right (CDR) and Open Banking. The CDR makes it clear that the consumer owns their own data and Open Banking provides bank customers with the ability to share their account data with other institutions, including non-banks.</p><p>Using these data, a non-bank could, for example, suggest accounts or cards that better suit a customer's needs or use the information for detailed credit assessment.</p><p>In addition, Comprehensive Credit Reporting (CCR) will provide (bank and) non-bank lenders with greater information about potential borrowers' credit history.</p><p>The second part is non-banks' data that is becoming more valuable for \"banking\" services. Much of this data is collected by \"big tech\" firms such as Google, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>For example, PayPal and Amazon have substantial data on the sales of their merchant customers, while social networking interactions can be used to predict borrowers' commitment to repay their loans.</p><p>Technology firms for which collecting and analysing data is in their DNA are a new type of competitor for banks that have historically struggled to take full advantage of the private data they hold. How well individual banks respond to technology challenges will no doubt influence their relative success.</p><p>Technological changes in payments are also challenging banks' core role in facilitating payments. To date, this erosion has been most apparent in emerging market economies where payments systems were not meeting customers' needs.</p><p>For example, in China and several African countries, online marketplaces or mobile phone companies have come to dominate payments (largely bypassing the banks).</p><p>However, in Australia, and other developed economies, existing electronic payment systems (including new real-time payment systems such as Australia's New Payments Platform) are already meeting customers' needs. Still, new payments providers engaging with banks and card companies could reduce the banking system's revenue from the payments system.</p><p>Where banks have provided poor service, such as in cross-border transfers, new competitors may capture market share.</p><p>This is already occurring with specialist firms undercutting the banks' very wide spreads in cross-border payments. Cross-border payments are also a potential entry point for \"stablecoins\", which could be used to make low-cost payments across borders, completely bypassing the banking system.</p><p>A second issue for banks is the impact that tighter regulation has on the cost of intermediating borrowing and saving.</p><p>Tighter prudential regulations, such as holding more capital and liquid assets, was anticipated by regulators to increase the cost of intermediation.</p><p>These expected higher costs were taken into account in calibrating regulations and are judged to be appropriate given the reduced chance of financial crises.</p><p>But higher costs for banks can push more borrowing to non-bank financial institutions or into capital markets. The share of credit intermediated by non-banks is small in Australia and so there are limited implications for financial stability.</p><p>But if it were to grow significantly, we would have to carefully assess what this might mean for financial stability.</p><p>A third issue for banks comes from expectations in terms of their obligations to the community.</p><p>Banks will need to adapt to a range of reforms designed to strengthen governance and culture at financial institutions. These should lead to less and better-managed non-financial risk. The measures include the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's proposed standards for how variable remuneration is structured and the response required to shortcomings identified by the financial services royal commission.</p><p>While these measures require banks to adapt, they will make banks more resilient, increasing their chance of responding to new competitors.Jonathan Kearns is the head of financial stability with the Reserve Bank of Australia.

That question is obviously different for the unbanked community in developing markets.\"</p><p>The Reserve Bank of Australia last week urged the banks to put more payments volume through the real-time payments system, which the banks spent more than $1 billion to build, in part to protect them from disruptive forces, including blockchain-based payments systems such as the one being built by Facebook.</p><p>\"Australian consumers can access their bank accounts in real time through NPP,\" Mr White said.</p><p>\"Such real-time payments have significant value to the underlying Australian economy because the receiver can use funds immediately - this is a value add of NPP compared to existing payment rails.\"</p><p>Mr Healy, NAB chief customer officer of business and private banking, said all of the banks \"will be keeping a close eye on [Facebook] as it develops and will be watching to see if it emerges as a real threat and imposing proposition\".</p><p>\"Developments like this give us the opportunity to learn, and also reinforce the need for us to continue innovating to provide our customers with the best experiences,\" he said.</p><p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that on top of the direct payment fees received by banks, payments influence $22 billion, or 20 per cent, of banking industry revenue and this was under threat by the emergence of digital wallets on smartphones offered by global technology companies.</p><p>Another banker in one of the big four was more sanguine about the crypto-currency threat. \"It's too early to know what the impact of Libra will be. This could just be a clever way for Facebook to sell more on their platform. Clearly it will be watched, but we aren't sure it's a threat.\"</p><p>Banks' revenue from payments is already under pressure from caps to interchange fees, which are paid by merchants, and ongoing scrutiny of credit cards by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</p><p>Morgan Stanley said if credit card interchange commissions and fees, and revenue from foreign exchange and merchant fees, were to fall by one-third, Commonwealth Bank's group revenue would fall 1 per cent, and profit would fall 2 per cent.</p><p>\"The success of Afterpay, Zip, PayPal and others demonstrates that the current regulatory settings are pushing innovation in payments outside the regular bank and credit card channels,\" Morgan Stanley said.</p><p>Rocky Scopelliti, a futurist who sits on the Australian Payments Council, described Facebook's entry into payments as \"an inevitable move, due to the role that social media is now playing throughout our lives\".</p><p>He said the rise of Chinese fintech giant Alibaba Group, which owns Ant Financial, \"shows what can happen when there is a diversification of service offerings across lifestyle processes. Millennials in China have shown the explosiveness of social media and payments coming together. There is a clearly a demographic appetite for the use of both services.</p><p>\"Facebook's move will be one of the first global micro-payment services that may emerge, although I think it will be harder for them to translate it to point of sale in a store, because infrastructure needs to change to enable that to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc75uxe3755au1m4uq9mm2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCH-5781-F0J6-J3Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Before 2017 most were still in a discovery phase seeking to work out the most suitable path for their business models and clients,\" says Sebastian Dovey, an independent wealth management consultant who founded and later sold the Scorpio think-tank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banks are now clearly devoting much greater resources and finances to meeting the digitalisation challenge, although both wealth firms and their clients are unlikely to experience the results of this for another two or three years, if we look at previous patterns.</p><p>There are other factors, in addition to the fear of the unknown, which are hampering major changes. Whereas traditional mass retail banking lends itself to wider-scale digitalisation, this is not necessarily the case for 'private' banking for wealthier clients.</p><p>\"Only a few private banks have the high volumes and processes which can be standardised, allowing major platform investments and acquisition of large numbers of new customers,\" says Urs Bolt, a Swiss-based wealthtech adviser. \"In many cases, from an incumbent's perspective, business cases cannot be justified, as their primary focus is on cost efficiency.\"</p><p>Despite these practical contraints, client or customer experience (CX) is becoming a driving factor.</p><p>\"CX is now finally on the agenda,\" says Mr Dovey. \"Before a bank can decide what to do next, it first has to systematically understand what it does now and how much it is valued by its current and future clients.\"</p><p>Many banks look at this whole exercise with a degree of cynicism - believing happy customers will buy more products - but the argument propagated by Mr Dovey is that CX is not just a tool on its own, but a resourceallocation technique, which can be used to determine the most effective business model.</p><p>Our judges also agree that through judicious digitalisation, new technology will allow relationship managers to actually spend more time focussing on higher value activities.</p><p>\"Ultimately, this should increase the amount of business that can be done,\" says Sharmil Patwa, founder of Opus Una Financial Services Consulting. \"While natural attrition can be used to restore balance, if digitalisation is done right as far as RMs are concerned, cost to income ratios should improve primarily due to increased income. Where we may see some active headcount reduction is in some of their support areas, including private banking executives and admin staff.\"</p><p>Most banks in our cohort are heading towards this hybrid model. While there is yet to be a true cultural transformation, management and bankers alike are beginning to see the benefits of innovation both for themselves and clients.</p><p>\"Hybrid will be the default model for private banks and wealth management firms,\" says Alois Pirker, research director for wealth management at Aite Group in Boston, US. \"Some will continue to lead with an adviser proposition, supported by technology, while others will start leading with technology and have advisers supporting a largely self-service experience.\"</p><p>There is also a widespread opinion that the most successful banks in digital innovation are those which bring in both clients and external fintechs into the design process.</p><p>Innovation is more likely to come from fintech firms than banks, confirms Mr Pirker. \"They can operate and think independently and are not incumbent by existing business processes and culture,\" he says, expecting independent or acquired fintechs to increasingly reside within banks or specially designated innovation centres, built by the banks. \"Fintechs are speedboats, banks are ocean liners,\" says Mr Patwa from Opus Una. \"The former moves fast, can get places fast, but cannot carry many passengers. The latter is slow and steady and has many passengers. They need each other and the symbiosis is starting. I foresee a lot of acquisitive activity of fintechs, the challenge will be integration, without killing their spirit and essence of what they are.\"</p><p>This new collaborative model, of banks, fintechs, technology, vendors and wealthy families all working together to build or share a joint platform or create an 'ecosystem' is increasingly being talked about.</p><p>\"Currently, there are very few wealth management firms which think in terms of platform services or even ecosystems,\" ventures Mr Bolt. \"I believe this will be key for the success of private banks, especially for Swiss firms if the country wants to maintain its role as a leading financial centre for private wealth.\"</p><p>There is also a widespread acceptance that without such collaboration, private banks will struggle to adopt a digital culture. \"If you asked 'big-tech' companies like Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Netflix or Google if private banking had a 'digital first' culture, you would be laughed out of the room,\" says April Rudin, president of the New York-based Rudin Group. \"Compared to technology firms, private banks have been woefully slow and inadequate in terms of embracing, let alone leading in a 'digital first' manner by anyone's definition.\"</p><p>BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, GLOBAL BBVA PRIVATE BANKING BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, EUROPE NYKREDIT PRIVATE BANKING Highly Commended: KBC PB Belgium BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, CEE KOMERCN\u00cd BANKA, A.S.

MORGAN WEALTH MANAGEMENT Having said that, she agrees that the pace of transformation has accelerated dramatically over the past year, \"as the urgency for real change has become a mandate at many private banks\".</p><p>While there is still much debate on whether blockchain - decentralised or 'distributed ledger' technology - will be one of these lasting innovations in the wealth management world, the role of big data and artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a game changer.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to five years ago, when these disciplines were seen as marginal, experimental projects, pursued only by a handful of players globally.</p><p>\"Wealth management is all about data and connecting the various databases that exist within a firm. Generating insights from the data will be a true differentiator going forward,\" says Mr Pirker. \"This holds true for any private bank, digital-first or adviser-led business.\"</p><p>The creation of a digital innovation culture, agree the judges, must be fostered by leadership and top-down transformation as much as a collaborative atmosphere in the firm's lower ranks. \"Change always requires tone-from-the-top and looking at one of the early adopters, DBS, their CEO Piyush Gupta, was a key force behind the transformation,\" says private wealth management business adviser Mario Bassi. \"He brought in strong change agents and created a culture of innovation, especially within private banking.\"</p><p>BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, GLOBAL BBVA PRIVATE BANKING BBVA Private Banking has shown significant commitment to promoting technology innovation over the years, with the result that the large majority of products and services are now available to clients through digital channels. Technology investments are focused on improving advisory services, on helping clients take betterinvestmentdecisions,whilemakingtheirdayto-day operations easier.</p><p>\"Digitalisation has helped attract new clients, including the younger generation,\" says Jorge Gordo, director of BBVA Private Banking. \"However, nowadays all clients are more and moredigital,regardlessoftheirage,becausethey know digital technologies enrich the way their wealth is managed and preserved.\"</p><p>Among others, a specific app - Mi private client - has been particularly successful in improving operational efficiency. The app offers access to a wide range of data, on clients and their portfolios, enabling private bankers, all equipped with a tablet, to bring their office with them while on the go.</p><p>More recently, the digital signature of documents has been a game changer. An app providing a global picture of a client's wealth, by aggregating all assets including those held with third parties, helps private bankers offer clients more holistic advice.</p><p>The introduction of 'agile working' in digital departments more than five years ago was part of the bank's digital transformation model. Today, all employees in BBVA headquarters work according to such methodologies, which helps autonomous teams achieve results faster, supported by technology.</p><p>BBVA has invested in several fintechs over the years, leveraging on its Open Innovation initiatives, aimed at boosting networking and collaboration with start-ups, while promoting innovation and investments in pioneers of fintech solutions.</p><p>Big data analytics and AI are being deployed by the Spanish institution, in specific sectors including real estate, allowing customers to discover and compare costs, and assess options. Clientscanalsoviewpropertiesdigitally,through a mobile phone camera using augmented reality. \"Banks have lots of data and we have to learn how to take advantage from them to improve client service,\" says Mr Gordo. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, EUROPE NYKREDIT PRIVATE BANKING Nykredit has been focusing its digitalisation efforts in key business areas, with the aim of coveringtheentireclientjourney,fromonboarding and attracting new clients, engaging with existing ones and promoting a digital culture internally.</p><p>A recently launched app allows client onboarding, previously a highly time consuming task, in a matter of minutes, and has been successful with both clients and private bankers, says Lotte M\u00e5nsson, managing director of Nykredit Private Wealth Management.</p><p>The bank's digital investment platform, Investor Insights, has enabled it to gain greater exposure to existing clients and prospects, with insights and news delivered through different channels, including podcasts and videos. Selected private bankers have been specifically trained to become 'ambassadors' and engage clients through social media. These initiatives helped the bank reach a record number of new clients last year.</p><p>Creating a digital culture is the result of cross-organisational initiatives, states Ms M\u00e5nsson.</p><p>\"The digitalisation process requires a change of old habits and that is, and has always been, a major challenge. Thus, creating a prodigital culture is an organisational effort.\"</p><p>Sometimes, basic or simple changes are essential to support the transformation and create a digital culture, she says. For example, the bank has issued templates suggesting how to communicate with clients digitally, and online workshops have given private bankers deeper insights into new digital tools. \"Not everyone in the organisation needs to have the exact same digital skills, but everyone has to reach a certain level.\"</p><p>The bank, which is one of Denmark's oldest financial institutions, is currently working on a new digital offering targeting its next generation clients. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, USE OF TECHNOLOGY, CEE KOMERCNI BANKA, A.S.</p><p>Komercni banka recently launched a three-year programme aimed at promoting a more \"agile\" organisation, where individual teams will have greater autonomy, and will be able to respond faster to customer needs, with digitalisation playing a key role.</p><p>The appointment of a digital officer has been just \"one of the many steps towards building a digital culture within the bank,\" says David Barczi, head of Digital Channels Tribe at the Czech institution. \"Substantial change management needs to come in place, and the involvement of senior management is crucial to drive it.\"</p><p>Komercni is developing a multi-channel business model, and mobile banking is the fastest growing channel. Clients are now able to quickly log in to their bank account on their mobile phone, and invest in funds by digitally signing their investment contract and MiFID II questionnaire. It was also among the first financial institutions in the country to launch Apple Pay, enabling customers to make payments and check their account balance through their Apple Watch. Such features drive an increase of cashless transactions, reducing costs for the bank.</p><p>KB's clients can also gain access to a consolidated view of their accounts, also held with third-party banks, through mobile and internet banking. This enables private bankers to gain better insights into their clients' wealth and personalise services.</p><p>Working in partnership with start-up Fakturoid, the bank launched an online invoice tool for entrepreneurs, which is hailed as the \"big start-up success\" of KB's in-house Innovation Lab.</p><p>\"The partnership with start-ups is one of our key strategic activities, which has brought concrete results for our clients and will continue to do so in the future,\" says Mr Barczi. The bank is in the process of finalising another partnership with a start-up and is working on making its digital authentication method available to third parties. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR USE OF TECHNOLOGY, ASIA UBS Disruption is a reality that every bank needs to address at the top level, believes the management team at UBS. Under J\u00fcrg Zeltner, the bank's long-standing wealth management leader who retired in 2018 after an apparent dispute with his bosses, regular tech teach-ins for both clients and relationship managers were held in key financial centres, including London and Hong Kong, with guest speakers typically from automotive, space or start-up spheres mingling with the audience in intimate settings.</p><p>This flexible approach remains central to the bank's strategy. \"Our approach is to innovate both inside the firm and work with external partners to find and integrate new technologies,\" says Patrick Steiner, head of omnichannel management at UBS.</p><p>The Swiss giant had introduced this strategy well before it became fashionable among competitor banks, recognising it could not remain at the helm of the private banking pyramid unless it took its inspiration for innovation from outside the stultified Swiss private banking industry.</p><p>The bank's wealth management technology platform was launched in the autumn of 2017, with key development hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Germany. The idea is that technology can be developed in one loca-tion and then shared through the platform with other territories.</p><p>The recent merger between teams in Europe and Asia with the previously separate US business has accelerated this co-operation around technology, says the bank, offering the examples of enhanced reporting and analytics tool UBS Asset Wizard and holistic advisory service UBS Wealth Way.</p><p>\"Whilst we maintain separate core platforms, certain applications, know-how, strategy, innovation and best practice can be effectively shared, yet implemented independently if required,\" says Callum Licence, programme director at the bank's One Wealth Management platform.</p><p>Yet there is also a strong belief within UBS that technology alone cannot provide the context, insight and interpretation required to make the best decisions. \"Since 2013, we have used automated systems to enhance our investment decisions,\" says Martin Hartenstein, head of WM Apac omnichannel, capabilities and platform management at UBS. \"However, a lot of qualitative human judgement goes into these systems and are an irreplaceable part of their development.\"</p><p>The challenges are even more pronounced in Asia, where the bank is keen to recruit new clients from China's tech-driven entrepreneurial community. It has recently situated an office in Hong Kong's newly fashionable Kowloon district in order to cater to this clientele.</p><p>Much of the technological impetus and direction previously came from Mr Zeltner's team in Zurich. It has yet to be seen whether the bank's new leadership will be able to match this inspiration and fast progress. YB BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR DIGITAL CULTURE, GLOBAL BEST INITIATIVE, CLIENTFACING TECH, GLOBAL BNP PARIBAS When BNP Paribas Wealth Management announced its new \"Client Experience\" in 2017, cynical tech watchers may have suspected another box-ticking exercise from a leading private bank.</p><p>But those who know the French institution well suspected the truth was far from this. BNP Paribas is one of the few banks to enrol other constituencies into its initiatives, not just internal players.</p><p>This means co-opting fintechs and clients into its factories and incubators across Europe and Asia to combine knowledge and experiences and together cook up real innovations. So far, using this model of working with external as well as internal partners, more than 20 new digital services have been made available to clients, with more projects in the pipeline. What is also striking about the bank, which many still perceive to have a \"French heart\", is that once you exclude the local clients' operation, just 250 of the wealth management firm's 7,000 staff are in Paris, with the Asian franchise, centred in Hong Kong, employing 1,300, having grown particularly well. Luxembourg is another hub for technological innovation, housing 350 staff.</p><p>\"We have developed our innovation labs not just in Paris, but in Luxembourg, Geneva and Singapore, to be even closer to some of our international clients,\" says Vincent Lecomte, co-CEO of BNP Paribas Wealth Management. While the chief operating officer resides in Paris, the tech teams developing and maintaining the platforms are based predominantly in India and Singapore.</p><p>One of the many innovations painstakingly built in these labs is the Leaders Connection app, which will bring together potential coinvestors in a secure network. Mr Lecomte and his management team believe that through instilling this digital culture in the bank, they are vastly improving client engagement.</p><p>\"This is not a question of age or generation,\" he says. \"We have increased usage of all digital tools over the last 12 months and this is a key KPI for our success.\"</p><p>Fresh from the drawing board come a series of new apps, including My Impact, which will help investment-focused clients engage with the UN's sustainable development goals through digital channels.</p><p>They are convinced that the more functionality they enrich the apps with, the greater the digital traffic they generate from the client base across their key target markets of Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>It is vital for the bank to keep responding to global forces which shape the wealth market, believes Mr Lecomte. \"Digitalisation and ESG are the two trends which are totally transforming our organisation,\" he says. \"This remains my conviction.\" YB BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR DIGITAL CULTURE, EUROPE INSINGERGILISSENBANKIERSN.V.</p><p>With the goal of enhancing client experience and process efficiency, Dutch bank InsingerGilissen, whose origins date back to 1779, has adopted an 'innovation lab' approach to drive its digital strategy.</p><p>Multi-disciplinary teams, including people from business, IT and third-party software providers, work together from off-site locations to design, develop, test and roll-out digital solu-tions. Embedding continuous client feedback and working on fast delivery development cycles - of around 12 to 16 weeks - allows the teams to deliver a \"tangible\" output, which is tested with clients and staff before roll-out, creating buy-in from the start.</p><p>While senior managers set the vision and digital road map, closely monitoring progress and delivery of solutions, business ambassadors, appointed among private bankers, have the responsibility to build a 'change platform' and accelerate the transformation process.</p><p>\"We aim to build a hybrid client experience, where digital reinforces and enriches the relationship between a client and their private banker,\" says C\u00e9dric Lebegge, chief operating officer at the Dutch bank, which is part of pan-European private banking group KBL epb.</p><p>One of its most successful initiatives has been the development of a 'dynamic' wealth planning solution, which enables private bankers to set scenario-based investment goals, tailor goal-based investment solutions and monitor feasibility of goals. Looking forward, the bank aims to increase \"client intimacy\" by further using data analytics to generate additional insights for bankers and make interaction with clients more relevant. Improving the process efficiency, by leveraging \"robotic process automation\", is also a key objective.</p><p>\"Digitalisation is all about business-driven innovation, about developing new and improved propositions, products and client journeys through a smart use of technologies, and not about technology-driven innovation,\" says Marc Baltus, chief financial officer at the bank. ET BEST PRIVATE BANK FOR DIGITAL CULTURE, ASIA KASIKORNBANK PCL The challenge in building a digital culture is in choosing and adopting technologies \"wisely\" says Jirawat Supornpaibul, private banking group head at Thailand's Kasikornbank. The bank serves clients with a minimum of THB50m ($1.6m) of assets, who are assigned a private banker.</p><p>During 2018, the bank embarked on the KPB Digitalisation Project, including a new private banking core platform. The project included integrating social media into traditional communication channels and a 'Digital World Familiarity' element that aims to shape clients' behaviour and prompt them to use digital technologies.</p><p>Despite the wealth of technologies that are emerging in financial services, private wealth clients continue to rely heavily on the human touch, says Mr Supornpaibul. \"Most of the technology we currently adopt is focused on supporting the services of private bankers, rather than replacing them as a virtual branch does.\"</p><p>The digitalisation project has improved client coverage as private bankers have more time to support sophisticated clients. During the past year there has been a 15 per cent increase in the proportion of more sophisticated funds that clients have adopted.</p><p>During 2019, Kasikornbank will focus on enhancing its digital platform by plugging in new technologies to cover more of its clients' \"frontline\" needs. \"We are also considering new social media platforms to expand our objective of digital communications from information delivery to increasing brand awareness and improving perception,\" she adds. \"We will also keep searching for new technologies from fintechs around the world to support the service of private bankers and also the back office.\" HM BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, GLOBAL CAIXABANK As one of the early movers in the vast consolidation which reshaped Spanish banking after the country suffered a financial crisis deeper than many of its European neighbours, Caixa leapt into the vanguard of fast digitalising financial firms.Private banking, under its genial, innovating boss, Victor Allende, benefited most from this trend, with clients and advisers able to trade, check accounts and assets and network securely, way before these services were available in other countries.</p><p>Now the bank faces the 'first mover' challenge of keeping up with rivals, many of whom are in an earlier stage of the digitalisation process. It is spurred on by the conviction that only through continuously improving the customer experience - through both 'human' and digital channels - will the volume of transactions and profitability grow. \"New technology allows our customers to be with us more often,\" believes Mr Allende, executive director of CaixaBank Private and Premier Banking. \"This changes the way they interact with the bank and consequently, how and when they carry out transactions.\"</p><p>While Caixa has in recent times launched an omnichannel digital advisory process and a robo-advisory service, its strategic plan for the next two years involves developing artificial intelligence, big data and cognitive technologies to further enhance customer experience. This will include help with succession planning through creating algorithms which identify and analyse family units. The bank hopes this type of service will also help identify sales opportunities and optimise portfolios.</p><p>In parallel, other revenue driving and client gathering digital initiatives will continue to be rolled out, such as Ocean, an online broker platform for private clients, allowing purchase of third-party funds, detailing total costs.</p><p>Mr Allende recognises that with all these innovations come customer concerns about security, privacy and sharing of data. \"This is something that we take very seriously,\" he says. Moreover, his strategy in this area is that by using data analytics to monitor customer behaviour, his bank's technical systems will be able to spot anomalous patterns and looming threats and stop them before they affect clients. YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, EUROPE BEST PRIVATE BANK, BIG DATA AND AI, EUROPE BNL-BNP PARIBAS PRIVATE BANKING BNL-BNP Paribas Private Banking has developed a new onboarding customer journey tool focused on attracting new clients. The Youmanist app offers prospects the opportunity to experience the private bank's services for a three-month trial period. Importantly, using a proprietary algorithm, powered by machine learning, the app allows the bank to profile and target prospects, enabling private bankers to identify the most suitable services for them and convert them into clients.</p><p>Through the app, prospects have access to premium content, covering financial and nonfinancial solutions, such as lifestyle and worklife balance. They also benefit from personalised advisory services and can gain access to peer-to-peer communities.</p><p>\"Youmanist has generated a very high number of leads, and it has created a 'surprise effect' in the Italian private banking market,\" claims Gianpietro Giuffrida, head of BNL-BNP Paribas Private Banking. \"It represents a new way of approaching clients, starting from the individual and their lifestyle, and aims at offering holistic wealth management services, beyond the relationship with the banker.\"</p><p>In December 2018, the Italian bank launched a new app specifically for private banking clients, which allows them to check their portfolio, and digitally sign investment proposals received from their bankers. It also enables them to trade on the bank's online trading platform, manage their daily banking activities and access Youmanist premium content. The bank, which relies on a specific division dedicated to the analysis of big data, collaborates with universities specialised in statistical analysis and algorithms. It also partners with start-ups and fintechs, as well as incubators.</p><p>\"When developing digital solutions, we take inspiration from tech leaders and the luxury industry, to improve user experience, for example,\" explains Mr Giuffrida. \"But we never forget to involve our clients in the development phase. Their comments and feedback have allowed us to create solutions that meet their needs.\" ET BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, CEE AKBANK PRIVATE BANKING Clients' expectations as well as behaviours are constantly changing due to advances in technology and the private banking and wealth management industries are not immune to these changes, says Alp Keler, executive vice-president at Akbank Private Banking.</p><p>Despite advances in technology, the core value proposition of the global wealth management industry is still embedded in the quality of the relationship management, he adds. Akbank's Next Generation Private Banking model, Akbank Private Banking and Wealth Management Services, is the cornerstone of the bank's aim to provide the best digital and seamless client journey in Turkey.</p><p>Understanding and meeting clients' needs are at the heart of the model, says the bank. In line with this philosophy of transparency and efficiency, the Turkish bank has launched a \"new and accessible\" branch environment. This has enabled staff to communicate more directly with clients and work with them. The new branch and service design is \"shaping the future of banking\", claims Mr Keler.</p><p>The challenge, he adds, has been in getting the best combination of human and technology skills. \"We believe human and digital capabilities combined can generate more value than either one alone. To get the balance right, you need to concentrate on understanding your clients in order to prioritise your development phases in your digital projects.\"</p><p>Akbank has integrated multi-channel digital technologies with in-person interactions to improve client experience. The key to developing the digital communication model at Akbank is to create a work environment that will appeal to Turkey's \"most innovative and visionary youth\", says Mr Keler. HM BESTPRIVATEBANK,DIGITAL CLIENTCOMMUNICATION,ASIA CREDIT SUISSE What becomes evident from regular discussion with Credit Suisse is that although the bank is technically relatively advanced compared to competitors, functioning as an early pioneer in outsourcing much back-office work to \"offshore locations\", the pace of digitalisation varies through the organisation. This is common in many firms this size, despite their claim to operate as \"one bank\". In Asia, Credit Suisse has made a concerted push in recent years to come close if not unseat the long-term undisputed wealth management leader UBS. And the tactics and tools which Credit Suisse has been using come largely, although not exclusively, from the ammunition locker labelled \"digital warfare\".</p><p>There is a strong belief within the bank, particularly in the top ranks of the Asian division, that technology will remain a key strategic long-term driver and enabler of sustainable business growth.</p><p>The overhaul of the private bank's technology system in the Apac region started in 2012. This included a new client reporting system, a data management platform, and upgrades of core-banking infrastructure, as well as automated trading and pre-and posttrade checks for compliance, suitability and regulatory rules.</p><p>The delivery model began to visually change with new apps in 2015, when regional competitors began to take notice, allowing clients round-the-clock access to accounts, market intelligence and trading tools. The purpose of this was not just to improve the so-called \"client experience\" but to automate extensively and free up relationship managers to deliver higher value, advice-led personal services.</p><p>Now the Asian innovation teams have started to collaborate much more closely with European colleagues, whose technological infrastructure was falling behind. Innovations from Apac are being increasingly rolled out in European markets, including the Digital Private Banking app, recently adapted for clients in the UK and Guernsey. \"As a firm, we are committed to interact across teams and exchange innovation ideas and we will continue to do so,\" says Christian Osvald, head of client channels for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse.</p><p>\"Our management team is fully supportive on tech-transformant topics, we have the right business and IT teams to execute it and due to many successes in recent years, we find the front office and clients overwhelmingly supportive of the changes,\" he says. Key recent Asian initiatives include: Credit Suisse Chat, enabling clients to engage with the bank through secure messages on Apple Business Chat; a partnership with fintech company Canopy Ltd, which provides automated account aggregation; and the RM Ecosystem platform to simplify and automate the workload of relationship managers.</p><p>This vital role for relationship managers is crucial in the bank's vision of a partnership between technology and human advice. \"We partner closely with our front office to train relationship managers on our new innovations,\" says Mr Osvald.</p><p>\"They are the first point of contact for the clients, so it is paramount that they understand the innovations we are launching.\" YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, NORTH AMERICA NORTHERN TRUST Northern Trust is a bank that has always prioritised communication. Recently this has taken on a more digital nature, but it remains a relationship-based bank, which prides itself in the high numbers of bankers it employs across US regions.</p><p>The work of these bankers is increasingly being augmented by use of digital channels. Under the stewardship of CEO Steven L. Fradkin, who maintains an office in Silicon Valley in addition to those in Chicago and New York, many ideas are also being sourced from other industrial spheres. He says that in recent years, digital engagement and decision-making have become \"essential\" to his client base.</p><p>The centre-point of the bank's digitalised advice service is the notion of goals-driven wealth management, now also being developed by many rival banks. At Northern Trust, the GDWM technology was initially developed for institutional clients and has been adapted for wealthy private clients. The next stage of the bank's strategy will involve deploying these services in new markets across Europe, where the traditionally US-centric wealth manager is now keen to put down markers.</p><p>\"Northern Trust aligns world-class expertise in managing and optimising wealth and innovative technology to deliver an industry leading goals driven wealth management experience,\" says Mr Fradkin. \"The power of our technology enables clients and advisers to explore different holistic scenarios in realtime, visualise trade-offs and use data to guide and empower thoughtful planning and decision making.\" YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITAL CLIENT COMMUNICATION, AFRICA INVESTEC Investec likes to talk about its \"high tech, high touch\" philosophy, giving clients a choice of logging into Investec Online, using the mobile app, calling the 24-hour client support centre or setting up a meeting with their private banker or investment manager.</p><p>The pattern being noticed by management is one of an increased use of digital channels for bread-and-butter business and calls to their banker for more complex, longer-term transactions, such as home loans.</p><p>Recent initiatives in the bank's South African home market include its Ahead of the Curve website, aimed at young professionals, featuring both financial and lifestyle content, curated with what Investec describes as an \"often quirky\" feel. Focus, a separate thought leadership content portal, features articles on the economy, investments and innovation.</p><p>The bank's attitude to digitalisation and innovation is one of staying in tune with its various client segments and tailoring different approaches appropriate to each one, while never expecting a human conversation to be replaced by a machine-led approach.</p><p>\"Through regular innovations and strong partnerships with the growing fintech ecosystem, we continue to enhance our digital capability, with a strong emphasis on security,\" says Lyndon Subroyen, global head of digital and technology at Investec.</p><p>\"We remain focused on creating value for our clients and helping them be more efficient and manage their wealth better.\" YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, REGTECH, GLOBAL PICTET WEALTH MANAGEMENT Embedding compliance and regulation into tools and processes has been a key focus of the digital transformation journey at Pictet Wealth Management, particularly in view of MiFID II regulation, which came into effect in the European Union at the beginning of 2018.</p><p>In early 2016, the bank started developing a technical platform in-house, meeting pressing regulatory deadlines by focusing on core, basic features, while leaving the \"nice to have\" ones for later.</p><p>\"We understood we needed to adopt a holistic view to balance regulation, efficiency and ease of use, and find the best possible combination for users,\" says Philippe Turrian, COO and head of marketing and client solutions at Pictet Wealth Management MiFID II, which puts strong emphasis on product suitability and appropriateness, has not affected the quality or speed of client service, claims Mr Turrian. \"We have succeeded in making sure that bankers can transact for clients as quickly as before and still comply with all the necessary regulatory checks.\" The platform was launched in Europe in 2018, with the roll out expected in other regions in 2019.</p><p>Pictet is now focused on the implementation of the Swiss Financial Services Act, which regulates the provision of financial services and offering of financial instruments, aligning Swiss laws with the corresponding European framework, in particularly MiFID II. Leveraging on its past experience in EU countries, the bank is set to deliver the solution well ahead of the deadline on January 1, 2020.</p><p>Regtech technology is an important differentiating factor in private banking. \"We strongly believe that banks that succeed in creating 'convenient compliance' tools will manage their costs more efficiently and serve their clients better at the same time,\" says Laurent Gaillard, chief risk officer at the bank.

External representatives were also engaged to ensure the agreed sales and suitability guidelines were in keeping with a good sales process and local regulations.</p><p>\"The initial challenge to overcome, as with any programme that is complex in nature, was to ensure that it was well-sponsored and the vision was understood,\" says Warren McRae, head of business delivery and control at the bank. \"It was vital that everyone understood the delivery approach to be agile building on core deliveries in successive phases.</p><p>Communication and engagement was a key part of the project, with senior stakeholders taking time to explain the vision and context for the project.\"</p><p>Under the programme, the bank has implemented a single platform (Avaloq) for profiling and running sales and suitability checks and a single risk engine (swissQuant) across the business. Automated document generation has also been rolled-out and CleverSoft, which supports retrieval of required document from Morningstar has been integrated.</p><p>Future plans include the extended use of the risk engine, automated investment proposal document generation and a forwardlooking stress testing tool.</p><p>The bank was also highly commended for its robo-advisory services in Europe.

Citi also works closely with academics and research students at the University of London's Imperial College, plus educational institutions in the US and Dubai.</p><p>\"What we have is a terrific opportunity to engage with bright minds, to challenge existing assumptions and collaborate with external partners,\" believes Mr Watson. \"We are trying to connect with a community of fintech hubs and immerse ourselves in innovation.\"</p><p>But he is also keen to convince any doubters that this is far from a marketing exercise. \"This is not designed for us simply to meet, greet and aspire, but to address pre-identified challenges we have and to make projects actionable from the get-go. There is a time and cost impact on both sides, with cashflow a particular challenge for the start-ups.\"</p><p>When addressing the conundrum of wrestling with ever-increasing amounts of data and realising its power, Mr Watson says it is vital not to purely look at clients individually, but to aggregate their buying and investing behaviours to determine overarching trends.</p><p>\"We are part of Citi's global network, so we want to make sure we get a global perspective.\" YB BEST PRIVATE BANK, DIGITALLY EMPOWERING RMs, EUROPE BPI PRIVATE Portugal's BPI is reshaping its business strategy, taking into account digital transformation in the two distinct areas of customer experience and business support.</p><p>The bank says that it faces the challenge not just of transforming its business model, but actually adapting digital tools to the needs and characteristics of each client.</p><p>\"We want to offer the best of both worlds,\" says Antonio Luna Vaz, CEO of private banking at BPI. \"This means a digital experience when the client looks for speed and convenience and a human experience when he needs advice for more complex products or has an issue or problem.\"</p><p>The bank hopes to combine this clientcentric approach with the operational side, adopting information systems that use new technologies and promote \"agile practices\". In practice, this means trying to boost the bottom line by shaving operational costs and creating efficiencies not just through building digital platforms, but also through the basics of reinforcing data storage and protection capabilities. The next logical step after this is to develop so-called 'big data' capacity through analysing and leveraging this data for the benefit of customers.</p><p>BPI has been examining the work of external fintechs in this sphere, plus comparing the experiences of banks with players in other industries, such as Uber and Amazon.</p><p>Currently, BPI is developing a new private banking app, augmented by regular information updates about financial markets, while recognising the role of the relationship man-ager in exchanging message with clients, facilitating document updates and authorisations. Now that BPI is part of Spanish bank Caixa, a technology leader, observers are asking how much of the innovations are being developed internally and how much influence there is from central office in Barcelona. While Caixa has a tradition of allowing its subsidiaries to develop independently, few would bet against the sharing of a technological expertise and mindset across the affiliates.

Bankers spend less time preparing for client meetings and seek relevant information, and can add more value to their clients.</p><p>Particularly appreciated by private bankers is the ability to gain access to a consolidate view of their clients' assets, while the dashboard provides an overall position of all clients in their portfolios. New functionalities recently added to the dashboard include morning briefings, relevant news and product recommendations. The tool is also proactively suggesting client meetings, based on upcoming product maturities or new assets in their accounts.</p><p>Private bankers currently access the platform though computers and TV screens from their offices, but will soon be able to access it on mobile and tablet devices. This year, it will also be made available to clients in the bank's three main markets, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Croatia, Bulgaria and Russia will follow in 2020.</p><p>In most CEE countries, private bankers are supported by a content management system, offering tailored education material to clients about financial and non-financial matters.</p><p>In Czech Republic and Slovakia, a webbased platform enables clients to build bespoke structured products when meeting their banker, by defining parameters such underlying stock, maturity, protection level or yield. \"Future banking roles will be more customer-facing and data-driven.

This has strengthened relationships with clients, who are able to see a holistic picture of their wealth and can experiment with projection tools and multiple 'what-if' scenarios to build their financial future.</p><p>The platform can now be launched directly from within the bank's Adviser Virtual Assistant app, which has been further enhanced since its launch in 2017. From their Android and iOS devices, advisers can access client information, update client profiles and tasks, and review and approve electronic Know Your Client documents.</p><p>Overall adoption of both apps has continued to grow across Canada and the US, also because of the strong emphasis placed on training and supporting advisers. In 2018, myGPS was optimised for iPad, driving double digit growth in the number of myGPS projections completed, year over year, while AVA is now used by 2,000 advisers across North America. \"We take pride in saying that AVA was 'built' by our advisers, who since inception have been actively and continually engaged to provide candid feedback that validates which enhancements will come next.\"</p><p>Investing in digitalisation has benefited the bank's revenues and profits, while has also helping attract new talent and assets, states Ms Weeks.</p><p>By leveraging data science and big data, the institution has also developed a more holistic view of clients with relationships across multiple businesses within the RBC group. \"A richer client profile allows for more elegant solutions, which in turn helps with better prospecting, enhanced client discovery process, and a faster KYC onboarding process,\" she adds.</p><p>An interesting evolving area in AI for private banking is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where large amounts of text can be analysed and summarised quickly and effectively. \"This is an important capability in our data and information saturated times, allowing our advisers to quickly identify what's important and what the next best action could or should be, so that they can act accordingly in the interest of their clients,\" explains Ms Weeks.

Similar solutions are also offered for single and multi-family offices and independent wealth managers, via the bank's External Asset Managers (EAM) business, which boasts around 300 partnerships.</p><p>So why are other banks so interested in what happens at this apparently old-school Swiss private bank?

It helps clients with portfolio construction, advises on investment strategies and takes care of administrative and regulatory burdens.</p><p>The plan is now to replace this platform, as part of a long-term strategy, with a more mobile-friendly, real-time portal.</p><p>Lombard Odier acknowledges that few banks today have the commercial power to create such technology systems from scratch, expecting more smaller banks to enter such technology partnership arrangements.</p><p>\"Private banks in Switzerland and Europe face challenging conditions, with pressure on margins and profits, as well as more complex regulatory burdens,\" says Arash Sorouchyari, head of technology platform strategy and design at Lombard Odier.</p><p>\"As a result, such banks are becoming more open to purchasing third-party infrastructure solutions, as they look to streamline their processes.\" YB BESTINITIATIVE,RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTTECH,EUROPE ING LUXEMBOURG PRIVATE BANKING As clients increasingly use smartphones for their business and daily life, the development of a mobile private banking application was a logical step in ING Luxembourg Private Banking's omnichannel strategy. The My ING Private Banking mobile application enables clients to view, from a single screen, their investment products, review and download details of their portfolios, and access the Market Watch newsletter.</p><p>\"With an international customer base and today's progress towards a digital world, being present on the mobile market is fundamental,\" says Sandrine De Vuyst, head of private banking and member of the executive committee, ING Luxembourg Private Banking.</p><p>The bank's aim is to offer services to clients \"any time and anywhere\". The emphasis is on convenience and 24/7 availability.</p><p>While the bank has made substantial investments in keeping up with technological developments, Ms De Vuyst says digital channels are not the sole ways by which the bank interacts with clients but are an integral part of the client experience.</p><p>\"Technology and personal contact are complementary, which is why we aim to associate the two. Clients using My Private Banking can not only contact their relationship manager live through the app, they can also call them or meet them face-to-face and still be sure to address an expert fully aware of their personal situation and needs.\" HM BESTINITIATIVE,RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTTECH,CEE YAPI KREDI PRIVATE BANKING Turkey's Yapi Kredi Private Banking has developed a customised customer relationship management (CRM) tool for private banking and wealth management clients. The project, dubbed DNA, enables users to manage their portfolios and individual customers effectively, providing them with automatically generated alerts and KPIs through customised content, simplified processes and one-click solutions under one menu.</p><p>The previous CRM took involved numerous manual workloads, such as making requests via emails, initiating and following-up new clients' onboarding processes and tracking wealth. \"With the DNA system, it has become easier for all parties to track all of their activities easily and systematically,\" says a spokesman.</p><p>The main challenges in customising the tool was the fragmented CRM infrastructure, which required six different sub-projects to be created within a limited timeline. There were overlapping analysis, development and control phases throughout the development lifecycle and some projects included the use of outsourced third parties.</p><p>The spokesman claims the involvement of staff from the beginning of the project resulted in positive feedback and early adoption by relationship managers. Training sessions were held in branches and enabled one-to-one interaction. \"Digitalisation of everyday business and one-click solutions for time-consuming tasks also received positive reactions, leading to better customer management. Customer visits and satisfaction scores increased accordingly.\" Future plans for DNA include further digitalisation of the workforce through the deployment of tablet devices. Some modifications of the DNA system is in progress in line with these efforts, including identifying potential private banking customers to relationship managers with a location-based service. HM BESTINITIATIVE,RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTTECH,ASIA STANDARD CHARTERED BANK Standard Chartered recently launched an FX derivatives platform as part of its digitalisation journey. The platform, FXDConnect, has been popular among sophisticated investors, especially next generation clients, looking to invest in an 'all-weather' asset class such as FX, who invest regularly on a rolling basis and expect the most competitive and transparent pricing.</p><p>\"We recognise that clients are increasingly sophisticated; they are looking for price transparency, speed and convenience,\" says Alex Welch, global head of wealth markets products sales at Standard Chartered Bank.</p><p>\"Our Connect platforms for equity derivatives, fixed income and FX derivations, offer clients the suite of digital solutions across asset classes. FXDConnect allows us to achieve the next level of scalability via best execution in our product offering,\" he adds.</p><p>Using an open architecture approach on a digital multi-dealer platform, the platform opens the full market liquidity to the bank's relationship managers across the whole range of the FX derivative product class. While ensuring scalability, this helps RMs always execute on the best price sourced from a pool of liquidity providers, which is in the best interest of their clients, claims Mr Welch.</p><p>Developing different platforms present different sets of challenges. For FXDConnect, the most crucial part is selecting the right mix of product partners and liquidity providers and aligning the objectives and requirements with those of the bank's internal risk and infrastructure teams to deliver the desired final product.</p><p>FXDConnect is currently servicing the bank's clients globally, via its key booking centres across Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai and London. While the platform is now accessible by RMs, the plan is to make it directly available to clients. ET BESTINITIATIVE,RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTTECH,NORTH AMERICA MORGAN STANLEY In creating its advisory platform WealthDesk, Morgan Stanley has integrated planning, advice and risk, providing financial advisers with a consolidated view of client relationships and portfolios on one dashboard. Launched in November 2018, the platform provides a holistic review of the needs and investment objectives of clients across the entirety of their financial lives.</p><p>Developed in-house, WealthDesk brings together more than 10 applications available to advisers, including Morgan Stanley's Goals Planning System and Portfolio Risk Platform. Cross-functional teams were created across the bank's adviser and client teams. Consolidated applications and data technology were set up to enable an integrated view and strong governance was established.</p><p>The four main areas of the platform are portfolio advice (including integrated goal planning, portfolio construction and implementation) portfolio risk (a full suite of risk analytics to analyse clients' portfolios and assess the potential impact of hypothetical portfolio changes before they are made), relationship fee implementation (tools to help advisers estab-lish a more consistent pricing strategy) and client playback (a consolidated summary for clients that streamlines communications and advice across the client relationship).</p><p>Advances in fintech have enabled Morgan Stanley to create whole, integrated platforms instead of individual account numbers and siloed data, says the bank. In addition, partnerships with vendors, such as BlackRock and LifeYield have enabled the bank to more deeply integrate features into the platform. HM BESTINITIATIVE,RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTTECH,LATIN AMERICA; BESTINITIATIVE,CLIENTFACINGTECH, LATINAMERICA SANTANDER PRIVATE BANKING A key achievement in the digitalisation journey of Santander Private Banking was the launch of a multi-device, multilingual, modular and integrated tool, called Spirit, which has been developed and implemented in several countries in Latin America.</p><p>The tool meets private bankers' need to hold more dynamic conversations with clients, supported by free-flowing information, allow-ing them to go deeper into areas clients wish to explore, explains James Dunne, global head of digital investing for wealth management and insurance at Santander Group. It also allows them to meet with clients at their workplace or at their home, as they can \"take the bank along\" with them, on their tablet.</p><p>\"Of all the available features, bankers are really enjoying the advisory capability within Spirit which leverages a proprietary algorithm,\" says Mr Dunne. This delivers personalised recommendations, specific to individual client needs. The ability to sign documents and execute proposals while with the clients is also highly appreciated.</p><p>Earlier this year Santander launched an e-banking solution (web and app), a platform where clients can check product performance, receive portfolio valuations, chat with their banker and receive market news and updates, freeing up bankers' time.</p><p>\"In matter of months, we've jumped forward from a traditional online relationship with our clients to a much richer engagement method.\"</p><p>In view of such digital initiatives, customer satisfaction has increased, driving growth in both client asset retention and new business.</p><p>Speed of delivery is one of the biggest challenges in driving forward the digitalisation process, believes Mr Dunne. When bankers need a technological solution that could help them improve their performance, they can be \"very demanding\" until that solution is in their hands. Security is also crucial when it comes to digital developments.</p><p>\"A priority for us in our decision making is to protect our client assets and their information,\" he says.</p><p>Santander Group is planning to invest more than (EURO)20bn ($22.5bn) in digital and technology over the next four years, aimed at improving and personalising customer experience to further increase loyalty. ET BESTINITIATIVE,CLIENTFACINGTECH,EUROPE KBC PRIVATE BANKING BELGIUM KBC Private Banking's digital business model focuses on an 'all in one' approach, whereby clients are provided with a single mobile app, KBC Mobile, for all of their payment, insurance, loan and investment needs. In addition, the bank recently launched a number of new features to include relevant, non-traditional banking services.</p><p>These services are supplied through thirdparty providers and are plugged into the KBC Mobile app. KBC focuses on services it believes will make life easier for its clients.</p><p>Regine Debeuckelaere, general manager at KBC Private Banking, says by using third parties the bank can offer clients a broad range of services through the single app. \"At the same time, these services allow private banks and clients to have more time available for the human touch,\" she says.</p><p>Among the most popular applications of KBC Mobile has been the recent addition of a facility that enables users to pay for parking in Q-Park car parks; the app uses number plate recognition and payment is made via KBC Mobile. Other apps include one for bike rental and another enabling public transport tickets to be purchased; all of the purchases are made via the KBC Mobile app.</p><p>The bank plans to continue investing in the all in one approach by extending third-party services. \"It was challenging to find large thirdparty providers and to develop a seamless service for KBC clients but we found a mutual benefit for all parties involved,\" says Debeuckelaere. HM BESTINITIATIVE,CLIENTFACINGTECH,CEE RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL In 2016, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen (FWR) Private Banking (a subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International) started a group-wide project to digitalise its private banking holistic advisory approach. The result is the Wealth Management Platform, which offers a single, digital solution.</p><p>The main challenge in developing the platform, says Markus Plank, head of international affluent and private banking division, RBI, was to incorporate the bank's existing three-tier advisory offer (discretionary portfolio management, model portfolios and non-advisory services). A cross-functional, international team defined the characteristics and requirements of the platform. The result, says Mr Plank, is a tailormade platform for private banking.</p><p>Clients are presented with a holistic picture of their investment portfolios along with the degree of deviation from the advice given by the bank, portfolio risk figures and calculated performance. In addition, the platform provides reporting capabilities. \"More interested customers can also deep dive into transactions and portfolios to scrutinise their impact,\" he says.</p><p>The bank plans to connect the platform to clients' mobile devices to deliver investment and portfolio information. \"By doing this, we will be able to combine traditional face-to-face financial advice with the digital solution, enabling customers to view their portfolios, investment proposals and transactions any time of the day.\"</p><p>The comparison of \"as-is\" with \"to be\" situations will also be visible as well as central market research materials and videos to support the investment proposals of the bank. \"We see this development as a crucial step to retain and attract the millennials, and also to create a more convenient service for our elderly customers,\" says Mr Plank. HM BESTDIGITALLEADER KELLI KEOUGH, GLOBAL HEAD OF DIGITAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, J.P. MORGAN WEALTH MANAGEMENT Kelli Keough, global head of digital wealth management at JP Morgan, widely seen as one of the bank's key transformers, has no plans to rest on her laurels.</p><p>\"We have established a good digital foundation for our clients in the US and around the world,\" says Ms Keough, known by those close to her for her \"steely determination\" and her abilities as an \"energetic digital leader\", keen to keep adapting her business lines to the fastpaced technological innovations reshaping wealth management markets. The constant change she is witnessing reminds her the digitalisation journey is far from over. \"We still have work to do,\" she adds.</p><p>JP Morgan's reputation in the private banking industry is one with two sides, well appreciated by Ms Keough. The bank is seen as a product-centric firm, where the latest investment strategies are ruthlessly pushed through an efficient distribution channel of advisers to meet targets. Yet the quality of staff in an organisation seen in the US as the \"university of finance\" is second to none. Many bank insiders and observers believe these factors can be turned more to the bank's advantage to deliver customer loyalty. The digital channel, according to Ms Keough's assessment, provides the opportunity for this change and client satisfaction surveys back her supposition.</p><p>\"Digital is our strongest lever for impacting client satisfaction,\" she believes, promising to enhance the user experience of all private banking clients, improving their loyalty and stickiness of assets. Friends of Ms Keough, credited as architect of You Invest, JP Morgan Chase's zerofee brokerage platform, say she feels a strong sense of loyalty not only to the organisations she serves, but to the millions of clients whose financial futures depend on the bank. She has described this bond and her privileged position as conferring on her an almost \"holy\" responsibility.</p><p>Ms Keough's quest to understanding clients' emotions about money and what stops them from taking the next steps in their banking relationship borrows heavily from behavioural science, combining psychology - in which she has a PhD - with data-driven processes to help personalise messages to individuals.</p><p>She also takes much inspiration from the deployment of AI and machine learning in quality control, marketing and vehicle testing within the automotive industry, plus the shift from physical to online sales in the retail sector.</p><p>Despite her focus on process, teamwork and collaboration, Ms Keough acknowledges what many firms fail to take onboard, that widescale digitalisation and innovation must be driven by top management, who set the \"North Star\" for the rest of the bank's employees.</p><p>\"We also have to have the fortitude to set the path for all of us to follow,\" she says. \"Transformation isn't easy, but we embrace the role digital can play in transformation and we carry its torch every day.\"</p><p>Ms Keough brings academic learning as well as business experience to the job. She studied at both Stanford in the US and the LSE in London and had a long stint at Charles Schwab before joining JP Morgan in 2015.</p><p>\"Kelli has deep experience about how to engage clients digitally, a skill honed at Charles Schwab, where she was the GM of Trading Services, a firm and a business line whose success has been tightly linked to perfecting client engagement,\" says Alois Pirker, research director at the Aite Group in Boston.</p><p>But she is not yet at the pinnacle of her career and still has ambitions to climb higher in the banking industry, according to others in the financial community. \"She has taken risks in her career to get to this role,\" suggests a consultant who has worked closely with her. \"No doubt she will take more as she surges further up the leadership ranks.\" YB Profiles written by Yuri Bender, Heather McKenzie and Elisa Trovato</p><p>The digitalisation process requires a change of old habits and that is, and has always been, a major

It will then extend to energy and telecommunications, meaning the law will stir competitive forces across some of the most important industries in the country.</p><p>The Treasury Laws Amendment (Consumer Data Right) Bill 2018, released for comment last week, is being closely scrutinised by banks, fintechs and law firms across the country.</p><p>There's good reason for that: the World Economic Forum recognised in its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/world-economic-forum-ai-creates-new-physics-for-finance-20180816-h14376\">comprehensive report on artificial intelligence in financial services</url> last week that regulations governing data portability will shape which companies are winners and losers in the new economy.</p><p>The release of the exposure draft wasn't the only action in the emerging data economy last week. The second meeting of the \"data standards body advisory committee\", which is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/open-banking-standards-to-be-agreed-in-coming-months-20180619-h11kk3\">advising the Data61 data standards body's chair Andrew Stevens</url>, took place.</p><p>Early indications suggest the group - which includes the big four banks and Macquarie, who are counterbalanced by representatives from a smaller bank, consumer groups and fintechs and regulator observers - is coming at the design of the open banking standards with customers front of mind.</p><p> Banks vs disruptors </p><p>Three working groups have been set up by the advisory committee: one on application programming interfaces (APIs), another on security, and a third to oversee the \"consumer experience\". All will be critical, but the vigorous debate and disagreement between the banks and potential disrupters is likely to come in the customer experience group.</p><p>One of the most contentious will be whether customers will be able to initiate a data share from inside a fintech's website or application, or whether they will have to enter the bank environment. The banks - unsurprisingly - are keen for the later, but any technology player would know that any interruption to a consumer on-boarding flow, materially impacts conversion rates.</p><p>This bill is also important because it will govern how global technology giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook play in banking, energy or telecommunications.</p><p>They may not end up manufacturing these products but as the dominant platforms they can disrupt by accessing the data needed to make recommendations to customers about particular providers.</p><p> Door open to big tech? </p><p>It appears the bill has left the door open to them without requiring much in return. The open banking review chairman Scott Farrell recommended a reciprocity principle, meaning a business wanting to access bank data should have to provide back information it holds about its own customers. But Ashurst partner Tim Brookes says \"one of the unexpected outcomes in the draft law is the watering down of the reciprocity regime\".</p><p>Submissions on the bill, due on September 7, may also focus on whether value-added data should be part of sharing regimes.</p><p>Farrell ruled this out in banking, saying banks should be able to use raw customer data to gain insights on and keep this as proprietary information.</p><p>Yet Brookes says the result of data analytics \"is expected to be contentious\" given the wording of the bill and this could be problematic, because \"giving competitors access to this information could have unintended chilling effects on the use of analytics by businesses\".</p><p>The clock is ticking on aggressive deadlines for open banking and decisions made over the next few months - relating to the law and the standards - will define the impact the data sharing laws will have for consumers, and on the broader economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029799738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2V-H5X1-JBJ7-N4TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><timeReceived>03:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Currently, they seem to be gnawing beyond their turf as they now carry out some typical banking operations such as payments, deposits and lending, among others.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More revealing is the unabashed gain of momentum by BigTech companies such as Amazon, eBay, Google, Uber, Apple and Samsung and others, that have stretched their offerings beyond the expected lanes of their businesses, to begin to carry out typical banking operations such as funds deposit, loans and payments, among other operations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With these uprising trends in the financial space, there remains a huge hanging question-will traditional banks keep up the pace, partner with these FinTech and BigTech companies, or faze out of the scene with little contributions to the banking/money space?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was the crux of the conversation that traversed among policy makers, financial experts; the NDIC and finance journalists at the seminar for finance correspondents, organised by the Corporation, last year.</p><p>Financial Stability Board defines FinTech as technology-enabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on the provision of financial services.</p><p>The last statement '\u2026associated material effect on the provision of financial services,' means that it has an impact on data privacy, consumer protection and the way FinTechs are supposed to respond to regulatory authorities such as the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), among others.</p><p>BigTech, on the other hand, are large globally active technology firms with a relative advantage in digital technology.</p><p>It is interesting that technological disruption is having all forms of impacts (both positive and negative) on the finance industry. Some stakeholders seem to believe that technological innovations will lead to new and better products and services for customers. However, payment services seem to be the most affected and disrupted by technology, followed by customer management and retail lending.</p><p>Banking is gradually and will be diametrically different as the years unfold, as FinTech and BigTech companies are increasingly stepping on banks' traditional territory.</p><p>According to the 22nd Geneva Report on World Economy, 'BigTech and FinTech are increasingly competing with banks, but in different ways. banks are likely to see FinTechs as technology partners and as competitors. BigTechs, on the other hand, are less likely to be seen as partners.</p><p>'Technological disruption challenges not only the business models of banks but also the existing models of regulation. Financial stability, competition and data protection remain the three over-arching goals of financial regulation. The challenges range from cloud computing and artificial intelligence, to activity-based regulations, takeover legislation and data ownership and privacy,' it said.</p><p>FinTechs', BigTechs' contributions to financial inclusion</p><p>Critical players in the finance sector describe this year as a defining one for the significant achievement of financial inclusion, especially among those in the rural areas. That is, by this year, 80 per cent of Nigerians should have unhindered access to financial services.</p><p>What is interesting is that FinTechs seems to be the greatest contributor and driving force for this target. Whether the target will be achieved remains a conjecture.</p><p>Although the NDIC's primary mandate lay in the effective supervision of insured banks, timely payment of insured deposits and the implementation of a robust and efficient failure resolution regime, the Corporation, alongside other regulators such as the CBN, SEC, NAICOM and others, is at the vanguard of championing the course for financial inclusion in the country.</p><p>In the financial inclusion strategy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2012, it was realised that only two per cent of adults had access to credit, while only 21.6 per cent and 24 per cent had access to payment services and savings accounts respectively.</p><p>However, two years ago, the CBN released an exposure draft of the Financial Inclusion Strategy Refresh. It was discovered from the report that one of the major reasons we failed as a country to meet the 2012 financial inclusion strategy was the lack of appropriately regulated level playing field for FinTechs.</p><p>This explicitly shows the critically important role FinTechs play to ensure holistic and exhaustive financial inclusion.</p><p>Mobile banking has become the most democratised form of banking operations in funds transfer and withdrawals, as more and more people find it most convenient to make and receive payments via their mobile phones and other related gizmos, instead of going through the arduous process of queuing endlessly in banks. FinTechs and BigTechs have made it easier to do this owing to their innovative digital platforms and services.</p><p>According to the Deputy Director, Research Department, NDIC, Dr. Kabir Katata, examples of FinTechs are credit cards, mobile payments, cloud computing and blockchain, and others. It is important to us because it helps the depositors and those who need to have access to financial services easier, faster and cheaper. That is why we are keen on enhancing financial inclusion.</p><p>'FinTech promises to help achieve the efforts by the CBN in terms of financial inclusion, supported by the NDIC and other agencies.'</p><p>He further added: 'It can also help Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs) get access to credit, enhance competition, as well as increase the resilience of the financial system if it is done right. If it is not done right, then we have a big problem'.</p><p>Challenges banks face from the entry of FinTechs, BigTechs</p><p>The threat to banks' extinction is not a recent phenomenon. However, with the flurry of disruptions in the banking space, experts are forced to ask: Is this the beginning of the end of the banking system, as new technologies seem to be changing the way individuals and businesses use financial services in general, particularly banking services?</p><p>In some cases, specific demographics, especially the millennial, are moving away from traditional depository institutions, into contemporary banking and FinTech platforms.</p><p>The Geneva report on World Economy noted: 'Two-thirds of millennial Americans moved $24 billion through the mobile P2P platform Venmo in the second quarter of last year.</p><p>'BigTech firms are challenging incumbent banks, but in a different manner than FinTechs. Big- Tech firms are gaining significant traction in the provision of financial services in some markets, particularly in China, and are becoming active in other regions, including Africa, India, Indonesia and Latin America.</p><p>'BigTech firms have large and developed customer networks established through, for example, e-commerce platforms or messaging services. Their collection of proprietary data and use of technology, increasingly including advanced practices such as AI and machine learning, allows these firms to gather significant information on their users to help tailor their offering to individual customers' preferences.</p><p>'BigTechs have the potential to become dominant through the advantages afforded by both of these features - their collection of valuable data and their large, established networks (BIS, 2019). While FinTech firms initially did not interact directly with consumers, Big Tech's aim is to enhance the interaction with the user or consumer.'</p><p>For example, Amazon lent $1bn to SME in 2017, while Art Financials of China had $5bn in outstanding loans at the end of 2017, primarily to SMEs. As at last year, Amazon had given out $5bn to SMEs; now they are battling court order to start accepting deposits.</p><p>Dr. Katata said: 'It is also important to understand that FinTech is broad. For instance, there are banks that exist only digitally, where you open an account and carry out transactions online; consumer protection is through e-mails; customer services through e-mails and phone calls, among others. FinTech has made this possible.</p><p>'We also have what amazon is doing. The fear of Amazon is the beginning of wisdom. They have put out a lot of book stores out of business; anywhere they touch, they disrupt, amass and move on.</p><p>'We have applications such as open banking where you can have different deposit rates. For a long time in most of the developed economies, you will see that FinTechs have access to customers' data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), so that you can have the rates and comparison sites. There is also cloud computing, artificial intelligence - where customers can chat and inquire about banking services, while the respondent on the other end is not human but artificial intelligence algorithm.</p><p>Godwin Emefiele</p><p>'Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of many transformative new technologies that will shake future financial services infrastructure and should be seen as part of the toolbox. The beauty of the DLT is in biometrics, which we already have in the Bank Verification Number (BVN).</p><p>'BigTech companies such as Amazon, Ali Baba and Uber also offer some financial services because they use their platforms to offer services. For example, riders use O-Pay, which collects BVN and also gives loans.</p><p>'However, we need to know the sponsors and promoters of O-Pay because they are encroaching'.</p><p>He further added: 'On cloud computing, if you want to set up a new bank, you don't need to set up a huge data centre or a huge IT department. All you need to do is go to Microsoft and other related companies and set up everything, then you are up and running.</p><p>'Although several banks are developing in-house financial technologies, however, we mostly import these technologies, which are offered by Google and others.</p><p>'The reason it seems as though the CBN and NDIC are slow in adopting or validating a FinTech is that when you develop something today, there is that small issue that it has to be tested and we need to know the company before they start to collect people's money or data. When operators say regulators are slow, perhaps, because there are processes involved.</p><p>'Another problem with the regulation of FinTech is that when you are trying to understand what they are doing, they don't want to explain to you; you cannot be licensed without being understood.'</p><p>New generation disruptors on the horizon</p><p>FinTechs are among the fastest-growing technology companies in the country. In 2019, FinTech firms raised over $120 million in funding. Already, some of these companies are top players in the world.</p><p>'According to a report by PwC in 2016, showing which part of the financial sector is likely to be most affected by FinTech over the next five years: It shows that consumer banking is first, followed by fund transfer and then investment banking and SME banking. Truly, their effects have been far-reaching.</p><p>'Money transfer and payments have been disrupted the most, even in Nigeria. In Nigeria, it is the payment that is most affected by the disruption in the banking space. The guideline and circulars released by the CBN have been very instrumental in guiding the space.</p><p>'According to PwC 2017 survey, what drives FinTech is their data analytics and Artificial Intelligence,' said Dr. Katata.</p><p>Among the top players in the FinTech space are Interswitch, Flutterwave, O-Pay, Paystack, Branch and TransferWise, among others.</p><p>There is the overarching concern for the security of funds as cyber hacking has become the order of the day, making banks and other financial institutions invest heavily in protecting their customers' funds and data against exposures to unethical hackers.</p><p>In 2016, cyber thieves looted over $100 million from Bangladesh's Central Bank. Sometimes we hear that Microsoft website has been hacked, Cisco is having issues, among other issues. Cyber risk always exists in as much as you are online. Banks suffer from operational risks and critical infrastructure.</p><p>There is, therefore, the need for financial institutions, their customers and everyone dealing and trading with FinTechs, BigTechs, to pay extra attention to how they use and give up their data, passwords etc., in the process of carrying out a transaction.

These are a few of the topics I'll be focused on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology and the revolution. Today, partnerships between chief information officers and other leaders are crucial in setting firmwide business strategies. As the gap between technology and the business shrinks, so does the distinction among front, middle and back office.</p><p>Oftentimes, what we're selling is the technology itself. Services like deposit-taking and payment processing are not new. We're selling customers a technologically advanced way to deliver that capability. This puts the CIO and technology teams at the center of banks' business in ways they weren't before. Gone are the days of hiring tech leaders simply for their ability to write code. Now they need to be able to identify and understand a business problem and apply technology to solve it.</p><p>Technology as a black box. Too many people in our industry apply magical thinking to technology. They expect amazing results if they just funnel enough money into it.</p><p>The notion that technology is separate from the business is destructive. Businesses don't bet on magic. We bet on technologists and capabilities that solve business problems, serve customers brilliantly and make it easier to get work done.</p><p>Big data. I vote we all stop using this term, which makes mysterious an idea that is conceptually simple, if difficult to execute. The basic idea is that banks need to manufacture, store and use data to better serve customers and grow the business. It's important that banks distinguish between uses of data that are interesting to consider and those that are actually impactful. The danger of an overly theoretical focus on data is that you produce a lot of work that falls into the first category and pay little attention to the second.</p><p>To cloud or not to cloud. Agility is the sun around which all planets revolve. Information technology organizations must eliminate barriers to scale and build virtual infrastructure that can adapt rapidly. We also must connect legacy systems in ways that provide the required elasticity for the tools and technologies we work with today: tablet and smartphone apps, social media analytics, location-based services, and an array of other post-PC tools and features. We must lay a foundation that allows brilliant and creative people to introduce innovative ideas and solutions.</p><p>Innovation in the service of simplicity. The world and the technology that runs it grow more complex every day. Our challenge is to deliver solutions that make the complex simple. Innovation is critically important, as long as we keep in mind that our goal is not to produce shiny new toys but to make people's lives easier. Information security is a great example. The innovations that help most combine security with simplicity, enabling customers and clients to manage their finances with confidence.</p><p>My mission at the World Economic Forum is to advance the conversation among industry and policy leaders about the impact these trends and issues will continue to have on our customers and clients, our businesses and the economies in which we operate-and how we can continue to work together to build a stronger and better global financial services industry in 2015.</p><p>Cathy Bessant is the global technology and operations executive at Bank of America.

The response has largely been a shrug of the shoulders, as if to say: \"Oh well, there's always collateral damage in a royal commission.\" The more persistent criticism has been that Hayne, despite his ferocious demeanour in the public hearings, blinked when it came to recommending the structural reforms required for lasting change.</p><p>Former ACCC chair Allan Fels is in the latter category of critics. In a biography ghostwritten by journalist Lucinda Schmidt, Fels says the royal commission left a \"plethora of unresolved problems and has relied too heavily on regulators and reform of bank culture to prevail\".</p><p>\"I believe there is a considerable risk of relapse in a few years The amounts of money involved are so great that the temptations for poor practices are enormous, and the best way of resolving the problem is with structural solutions and with measures that resolve remuneration conflicts.\" Fels harbours no doubts that a lot of time and effort is going into the transformation of bank culture. However, he's sceptical that about how long it will last.</p><p>For a start, significant recommendations from Hayne affect lower-level operatives, such as mortgage brokers and commission agents which might or might not come to fruition.</p><p>If they don't, Fels says, the output of the royal commission will have been \"modest\".</p><p>As for the issues it didn't canvass, the former competition tsar has a list, starting with the industry's remediation practices which have short-changed their customers, as well as the removal of conflicts between executive rewards and commission agents on the one hand, and consumers on the other.</p><p>Fels says that Hayne should have tackled the structural issue, where financial institutions offer products and services while at the same time providing supposedly impartial and independent advice on the best products and services in the market.</p><p>He acknowledges that most of the major banks are separating their advice businesses, but says these decisions can be reversed, as the break-up and reintegration of energy companies shows. The royal commission, he says, has been an important exercise in the history of banking.</p><p>However, it's likely to be overshadowed by two other developments - the growing scale of superannuation funds, which will soon be many times the size of banks. Will they acquire banks? Will they gradually establish their own banking businesses? Where will the banks be in 20 years?</p><p>The second development is the likely entry of the big tech platforms - Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple - into retail and, ultimately, into other forms of banking. \"The platforms may succeed in monopolising the organisation and distribution of loans to consumers and small business,\" Fels says.</p><p>\"They are helped by a factor that has not been present in other attempts to 'beat the banks': the availability of customer <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:data.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter\">data.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter</email>: @Gluyasr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-b80e1deecd1511e9b23175f625beedaf8e45b564732feeb3a1769f4a59621914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYH-J0V1-JD3N-52V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

Great to  be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, the look on your face.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lot to talk about this morning.  Yes, what a press conference  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was.  It was to be kind.  It was a meeting, it was a summit  that the United States didn't have to have and you essentially burnish the  reputation or at least image of a anti-American goon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think the Journal really hit it right in the Op-Ed this  morning, the Trump first doctrine and they say, \"The charitable explanation  for this kowtow to the Kremlin is that Mr. Trump can't get past the fury  that critics claims his election was tainted by Russian interference and so  he couldn't resist in front of the world going off on a ramble about  Hillary Clinton's e-mail and democratic servers.\"  It was -- it was  disappointing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was.  And it was -- and the criticism is not just coming from  the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it is some of the things that you would hear on other  networks are extreme and just off -- you know, off the chain.  However, you  do hear criticism from members of his own party.  Even the likes of Newt  Gingrich --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who is a great supporter of the president and he said that  President Trump must clarify statements in Helsinki on our intelligence  system and Putin.  It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and  must be corrected immediately.  Sadly, this is not something that will be  fixed in a tweet or a series of tweets.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I wonder if sanctions are coming next.  I -- and here's my  logic --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. it's a good point.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- the president is going to be called -- he has been called  weak because of this and I think he's going to feel a need to respond to  that accusation of being weak in front of Putin.  And the U.S. has imposed  sanctions on Russia in the past as a result of election meddling.</p><p>So I think we could see that coming down the road.  The president looks for  some way to respond to this charge of having been weak on a world stage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because I don't think there's any question that the Russians  tried to undermine the West, has been trying to undermine the West for  decades and meddled in our election.  We've got the report right here,  report on Russian active measures from the Intel Department, this is from  Devin Nunes and the Intel -- the Intel Committee rather which released in  March.</p><p>So there's no question about that but the president did not want to address  it in front of Vladimir Putin which is a head scratcher.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's -- as you point out, these are not partisan  findings, these are bipartisan findings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  And this has nothing to do with collusion.  This is not  about Donald Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is about the Russians undermining the U.S.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not about Donald Trump.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What's also head scratching is he had spent the previous days  sticking his finger in the eye of so many allies in Europe.  You know,  Theresa May in London and --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Angela Merkel with --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and Angela Merkel in Germany.  And, you know, how do you  turn from --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He said -- he said Germany is totally controlled by Russia.  He  said that during the --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  He also -- he also called our European allies foes and then  when asked if Russia was a foe, he said they're a competitor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Competitor.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's just --</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I think it's just going to be going forward with this is  do as our -- in our position in foreign policy around the globe too, is  just a question.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And another question, who quits in this administration, if  anybody, but who quits?  That's certainly being discussed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are questions that we could see resignations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  We'll see how long lasting this is.  It  was probably the low points of the presidency so far.  What's more  important obviously is the deals that he can do with Russia.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- well maybe not with Russia but what about -- what did  Kevin McCarthy tell you on Sunday Morning Futures which I know is on the  agenda for today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Brady the Head House Committee and Means --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh excuse me, Kevin Brady.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- said that they're working on 2.0 and he basically laid it  out for us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So as Kevin Brady, the Head of House, Ways and Means goes to  the Congress and the president and meet -- the president meets with  Congress today, we will get more information but we'd actually got it  because Kevin Brady told me on Sunday, so we'll have that for you.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining us, an exclusive interview with the CEO of  Microsoft, Satya Nadella is here.  Utah Congressman John Curtis is joining  us this morning, along with former Deputy Defensive Secretary under Bush  43, former Ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz is here.  Along with Fox  News Senior Strategic Analyst, Retired General Jack Keane.  Former Senior  Advisor to Clinton and Stagwell Group President, Managing Partner, Mark  Penn is here as well.  We got a jam-packed show and it is a big one, so do  stay with us.  </p><p>Let's kick it off right here with our top story and that is financials in  focus once again, Futures here in the U.S. pointing to a mixed opening this  morning but it will be much about the financials ahead of the Capitol Hill  testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell and Goldman Sachs  earning.  Jay Powell will meet with the Senate today, he will have his  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony today with the Senate and tomorrow with the  House.</p><p>Financials got a boost yesterday after Bank of America reported quarterly  numbers on the hills of strong earnings from J.P. Morgan Chase last week.   And as you see the markets were mixed at the close.</p><p>Joining us right now is Hilton Capital Management Chief Strategist, Bank  Analyst, Dick Bove.  Dick, good to see you.</p><p>DICK BOVE, BANK ANALYST CHIEF ANALYST, HILTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Thank  you Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nobody knows the banking sector better than you.  You've got  bank stocks underperforming recently, certainly the broader markets.   Although we had a pretty good run just the last couple of days.  What's  your take on the earnings story.</p><p>BOVE:  Well I think you swing between the yield curve and earnings.  In  other words, when people think about flattening or potential flattening of  the yield curve, they sell these stocks.  When they think about, you know,  earnings are actually pretty good coming in over the last few days they buy  these stocks.</p><p>So the question becomes what is the more compelling of the two when you  look longer range?  And I think if the economy does grow with the rate that  people are projecting, bank earnings will continue to go up and the stock  should be OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there a sense from your standpoint of better loan  growth, a better backdrop, what do you think are the headlines right now in  the financial services sector?</p><p>BOVE:  Well yes.  I think -- I think it's very clear that loan growth is  coming off the bottom.  In other words, it was doing really poorly at the  turn of the -- turn of the year.  And now it's starting to rise.  But it's  not uniform.</p><p>In other words, you're seeing an improvement in commercial industrial  loans, you're seeing a decrease in auto loans.  So if the bank is more  associated with lending to businesses, it's doing really well.  If it's  more associated with lending to the consumer, it's not doing as well.</p><p>BELL:  So what does that mean for the regional banks?  Because we haven't  really heard too much with PNC report on Friday was a pretty good result  but later this week we'll get more of the regional results.  Is this loan  growth going to transfer to them?</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  In other words, if you go a little bit downstream, a little  bit further than the big regionals, when you look at the midcap pangs,  they're actually hitting the ball out of the park.  I mean, they've got  loans of 12, 10 percent in loans whereas the big banks are struggling to  get loan growth at the two, three percent level.</p><p>So if you want to just move on a little bit from the big regionals and the  big universals, I think you'll find a lot of good stocks.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dick, we're 10 years into this economic cycle, it's the time  where you going to start wondering if there's excesses building somewhere,  where is the next bubble going to happen that could end this expansion?   Where do you see excesses if at all in the financial sector?</p><p>BOVE:  Well I think it's quite clear that it's commercial real estate.  I  think that commercial real estate is a bubble.  I think that you are going  to see loan losses coming up in that sector.  And if the economy would have  weaken meaningfully, you would see a lot of loan losses cramping up the  banks in that area.  So that's the --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And what banks are exposed to that?  You always have -- you  always have to wonder what banks are going to go down when the next asset - - exit boom ends.  Where is the concentration of a commercial real estate - -</p><p>BOVE:  Well, again, unfortunately to contradict what I just said to  Lindsey, the fact is that the biggest lenders in the commercial real estate  market tend to be the midcap banks, right?  So the net effect is, they're  doing extraordinarily well because that sector has done extraordinarily  well.  But if that sector pops, they're going to get hurt and no way -- no  way to avoid it.</p><p>BELL:  The quality of loans though has remained very strong, at least from  what we've heard from the big banks because there's this major concern that  consumers are taking on more debt.  But the quality hasn't really been  impacted yet.</p><p>BOVE:  The only place where the quality of lending has been impacted is in  the auto industry.  In the auto industry, we're seeing a lot of subprime  lending being done again and we're also seeing, you know, deals being made  with dealers of cars that are not very attractive for the banks.</p><p>But in general, loan quality is extraordinarily good, loan volume is  increasing, margin's stable.  So, you know, from an earnings standpoint,  you know, the banks are not -- are not in trouble at all.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And then we've got Jay Powell testifying today.  A lot of  people are going to be -- you know, are wondering if they're signaling four  interest rate increases this year or three interest rate increases this  year.</p><p>Does it matter that much to the banking sector if the Fed is doing three or  four?  And what are you looking for out of Powell?</p><p>BOVE:  Actually, I'm looking for the president to take control of the Fed,  all right?  In other words, you've got seven people on the board of  governors of the Fed in theory.  There's actually only three there, two of  the three were put there by the president.  Two more are now waiting for  the Senate to approve them to be put there.  And then there's two more  still that the -- that the president will put on the Fed board, so we'll  have six --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, I don't think anybody wants that, the Federal Reserve is  supposed to be independent.</p><p>BOVE:  I know.  But the -- it's going to happen.  In other words, there's  been a change in the head of the FSOAs, it doesn't matter what these are.   The head of the FOC is changed.  The head of the FDIC is changed, the head  of the NCOA is changed, the head of the OCC is changed --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure, sure.  Yes, all new regulatory hit.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  Every one of them have been changed.  And all these people  bank is that they're coming in as opposed to bureaucrats and laborers.  And  I think that I like the change.  But the fact of the matter is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  I think -- but well, it make sense because he's  rolling back regulations and this is a whole new agenda for these agencies</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  And these --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure.  I understand it has.  Let me ask you real  quick before you go, are the banks going to pay higher dividends do you  think this year as a result of a better banking?</p><p>BOVE:  They will.  But I think they're giving away too much capital.  I  think the biggest weakness in a bank balance sheet right now is that if you  look at the capital -- the common equity of J.P. Morgan, Bank of America,  Citi Group, it's all down year-over-year and these are capital intensive  businesses.</p><p>You can't give away your capital of you need your capital to grow your  business and that's what they're doing.  So from a longer term perspective,  I think they're making a big mistake here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And don't get -- and don't get sucked in if you're an individual  into those higher dividends which is the mistake that so many, just regular  Americans made during the financial crisis.  I'm not saying these banks are  going to go out of business but many -- my parents own these stocks because  they paid high dividends and then when the economy turns, look out below.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Back up the dividends --</p><p>BOVE:  Yes, you're right.  Last time around --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- first thing to do.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  Last time around it was really painful.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's not just -- it's not just cutting the dividend,  it's capital losses and in some instances, all year equity was wiped down  in these banks.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll leave it at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick, thank you so much.</p><p>BOVE:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights from you as always, we appreciate it.  Dick Bove  joining us there.  </p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Prime Day not quite ready for  Prime Time.  Amazon site suffers a big glitch yesterday.  Despite the  issues, the stock soars.  CEO Jeff Bezos makes history with his wealth.  </p><p>And then get ready for high heel crocs, the company classics getting an  upgrade and a high price tag along with it, back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Amazon's Prime Day stumbling out of the gate  yesterday with a major glitch.  Cheryl Casone with all the details, Cheryl  good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, good morning Maria.  Well,  yes, instead of scooping up bargains, the shoppers were met with this, a  sorry page that does show cute dogs.</p><p>About an hour into the event Amazon suffered an outage that frustrated a  lot of their customers.  Many took Twitter like this person saying, \"Dear  Amazon, are you all going to extend Prime Day?  Because I can't buy  anything other than a Frenchie, Yellow Lab, and other cute puppies and if I  bring another dog home, my fiance will murder me.\"  Well despite the  outage, Amazon say the first hour of Prime Day registered more sales than  in the first hour last year.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in modern history.   His net worth topped $150 billion.  He reached the milestone just as Prime  Day got underway.  Shares of Amazon have increased more than 55 percent  this year, which has added more than $50 billion to Bezos's net worth in  less than seven months.  Incredible.</p><p>All right.  Well, speaking of their competition, from Amazon over to Wal- Mart.  Wal-Mart's taking aim at Amazon by teaming up with Microsoft.  Wal- Mart has agreed to use Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence  technology to improve their e-commerce business overall.</p><p>Wal-Mart going to be doubling down on e-commerce to better compete  obviously with Amazon, it's the war of the retailers, right?  Here's a  preview of what Microsoft CEO said in his interview with you, Maria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADELLA:  Digital spend is just going to keep increasing.  And in the case  of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have  an amazing lead today when it comes to anything around offline commerce.   But they're increasing their momentum and online.  They're doing some very  innovative work on top of some of the tools and platforms we create and  that's why we create --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Well at the same time, Microsoft is working on a technology  that would eliminate cashiers and checkout lines from its stores.  Maria  has spoke about this, of course, in that exclusive interview.  That's  Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella.  We just played you a little bit of that.</p><p>You can hear that entire interview today, 8:20a.m. -- 8:00a.m. Eastern Time  right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Taking a look at shares of Microsoft,  they're lower in the premarket.  And shares of Wal-Mart, a little quiet  right now but they're down 11 percent for the year as soon that we talked  about offline commerce with Wal-Mart.</p><p>All right.  Meanwhile, let's talk a little more A.I., Microsoft's A.I.  technology also helping a famous brewery improve its beer.  Researchers at  Calsberg which is one of the largest brewers in the world are using A.I. to  make beer even better.  they're going to be deploying advance sensors and  analytics to help brewers predict flavors more quickly.  The researchers  are trying to build a catalogue of flavors that will let brewers try out  different combination and experiment a little bit more with their beer in a  shorter amount of time.  Of course, it's all about speeding up production  for Carlsberg.  </p><p>So you've got A.I. in beer, you've got Microsoft in Wal-Mart, you've got  the competition at Amazon in that Prime glitch.  What happening to  technology this morning Maria?  And that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a -- this is a new thing.  A.I. in beer production, OK.</p><p>CASONE:  A.I. in beer, yes.</p><p>BELL:  Technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've seen it all.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  I love what they're doing with Wal-Mart though because it's  really going to -- you know, it's really going to help Wal-Mart just be  more productive and hopefully really help.  Because, you know, they've got  the offline -- I love that he talked about the offline sales, Amazon  doesn't have that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You know, Satya Nadella yesterday told me that this  transformation to digital like what Wal-Mart needs in terms of  transitioning to digital is a $4.5 trillion opportunity for Microsoft --</p><p>CASONE:  Incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- obviously an enormous number.  But you could believe it  because there's so many companies that need to better transition to  digital.</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  It could finally be some competition for Amazon which is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  -- getting their hands in everything, from healthcare to you name  it.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.  Don't count -- don't count off your local Wal-Mart man.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CASONE:  It's going to tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  you know, I tried to buy light bulbs on Amazon yesterday -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I saw your tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for -- it took -- I still never bought them, it was five  hours.  And by the way Twitter, I don't need you to tell me to get my car  and drive to Wal-Mart.  I live in New York City, there's no Wal-Mart in New  York City.  And I don't have a car here, so stick that one where the sun  don't shine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God.  All right.  Great stuff.  Thank you Cheryl.  Coming  up, the national guard is helping to arrest more than 10,000 illegal  immigrants.  More on how the Trump Administration gets a grip on the  southern border coming up.</p><p>And then Bryce's big night, the Washington National's right fielder Bryce  Harper dazzles as he wins the homerun derby, the dramatic victory coming up  right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump declaring the historic meeting  with Russian President Vladimir Putin a success in an interview with Sean  Hannity on the FOX News Channel last night.  The president said Putin is  going to help the United States deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.   Here's what he told the president -- the president told Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, when you look at  Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons and  if we start doing something and working on other countries and he also said  he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with North  Korea, we have time, there's no rush.  You know, it's been going on for  many years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us now to talk more about that, House Foreign Affairs  Committee Member, Congressman John Curtis of Utah.  Congressman, good to  see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN CURTIS (R-UT), HOUSE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE MEMBER:  You  bet.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do relations go with Russia from here?  What do you think  Russia can offer the United States and what's your reaction to what took  place in the meeting?</p><p>CURTIS:  Yes.  You know, I think the most important thing is to remember  Russia is not our friend.  And Russia -- history has proven that unless  somebody stands up to Russia they just keep on going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And is -- are there any areas that you think Russia can  be helpful to the United States having said that?  He just talked to Sean  Hannity about North Korea, obviously Syria and Iran is a major issue.  Do  you see any opening for Russia to actually be helpful to the United States?   We know that he's not a friend.</p><p>CURTIS:  Yes.  Of course, there are areas.  But first of all they've got to  stop their bad behavior.  They're breaking international law, they're  intruding on borders, they're using cyber attacks, interfering with our  elections.  But it's hard to imagine a place where we get that they  actually help us until we're going to get pass these points where they're  trying to hurt us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well to that point Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell, what can  you do as an elected representative to prevent meddling?  What do you know  to prevent meddling in the midterm elections and in 2020?  What are we  doing as a nation to stop it?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well I think we're also frustrated that we're not doing enough.   First of all, we know that they're aggressive, that they'll look for any  opportunity and that they won't follow their word.  So I think all of us  need to be vigilant and find every aspect in every opportunity to prevent  this going forward.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman, how did the president do yesterday in Helsinki in  your assessment and what does he need to do next after this meeting?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well I think what's frustrating people is it was almost like he  was off brand, right?  His brand is being tough and even with our good  friends.  And when he's not tough with somebody that's perceived to be our  enemy I think that -- people find that frustrating.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And what does he need to do next after this frustrating  performance?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well I think people would like to see him do what he does so well  and that's to be tough, to get -- put United States first and look out for  our best interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any way to stop Russia from undermining the West?  We  know that this has been taking place for decades.  So is there any way to  stop it?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well first, we need to admit it and confront it and talk about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CURTIS:  And you know, I think that's here, again, part of the frustration  from yesterday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well did you -- how about in the -- I just want to raise the  issue that incredible interview that Chris Wallace did with Vladimir Putin.   Putin acknowledge -- he essentially said with the hacked e-mails for a --  from the -- from the Clinton Campaign and he said, \"Well\" --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was all true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was all true, which was just astonishing.  That I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That he admitted it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Everyone sitting at home I think they're mouths fell  open when he admitted it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he did.</p><p>BELL:  Exactly.</p><p>CURTIS:  Yes.  And, of course, we're not surprised, we know that, right?   And so it is good to hear from him but you also see that there is no  feeling at all that, \"Hey, we'll do this again.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think that the president was not tough enough in that  press conference because he feels that admitting that Russia is a bad actor  puts him in a corner because the left has positioned it that there was  collusion even though we haven't seen any evidence of it?</p><p>CURTIS:  You know, this is a president that never gets backed into a  corner, right?  I think here again that's part of who he is.  He -- and  he'll say what needs to be said no matter what.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CURTIS:  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears and ask you about China sir because the  U.S. filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization now against  China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Turkey.</p><p>The latest stage in tit-for-tat retaliations prompted by President Trump's  decision to pursue tariffs earlier this year sighting national security  interest in unfair trade practices.  Again, China, a bad actor in many  ways, stealing our intellectual property for decades, is there any way to  stop it?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well we have to stop it and -- but this is -- this is evidence  that nobody wins a trade war.  And I would advocate that we need to  recognize the imbalance, we need to recognize the manipulation of currency.   We need to recognize the overproduction, all of those things.  But there  are a lot of tools in the tool box that we need to be using that don't put  American businesses and American jobs at risk. </p><p>BELL:  Do you think that this gets to a point where -- of escalation where  Congress is going to actually have to act and put more binding language in  to policy about the president not putting tariffs into effect?  I mean, the  Senate passed a nonbinding bill just recently about that, what do you see  happening down the road?</p><p>CURTIS:  Well the Senate passed that 88-11 and that speaks loudly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CURTIS:  And the House is taking it up as well.  And I think you're seeing  the lawmakers feel like we do need a role in this and we want to be  involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the tax conversation?  The president is  going to be meeting with members of Congress today at 2:00 p.m. to talk  about Tax Reform 2.0, the president told me this was coming when I  interviewed him last month.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're doing a phase two, we'll be doing it probably in October,  maybe a little sooner than that and it will be more of a middle class, we  did a lot for the middle class but this will be even more aimed at the  middle class.  One of the things we're thinking about is bring in the 21  percent down to 20.  And then for the most part, the rest of it would go  right to the middle class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there was House Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Kevin Brady with me on Sunday who basically laid out what he sees Tax  Reform 2.0 looking like, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:   President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was about changing the economic  direction of the country for the better.  2.0 is about changing the culture  in Washington where we don't wait 30 years between fixing the tax cut.</p><p>We get better every year, we continue to lead the rest of the world here.   And so you're going to see I think permanence of the middle class cuts and  those business cuts will be the centerpiece of this and people I think  overlook the growth impact long-term.  That alone could help create a  million and a half new jobs in America, continue to raise paychecks  significantly in the long-term.  So that'll be the centrepiece of it.   We're working with the President on the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will be your priority in terms of tax plan 2.0,  Congressman?  </p><p>CURTIS:  Well, as Chairman Brady said, as chairman Brady said, the  permanency for individuals is just critical.  I think that's something all  of us want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Congressman John Curtis,  good to see you this morning.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>CURTIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, sir.  Coming up, Johnson &amp; Johnson earnings  expected in just a few moments.

We are  expecting the bank to announce the secession plan, as well, for CEO Lloyd  Blankfein with David Solomon, taking the helm, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July  17th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.

We're also expecting the bank to announce its secession plan for CEO Lloyd  Blankfein, the leadership shakeup, coming up.  We are obviously expecting  David Solomon who has -- they have already announced to take the helm  sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, is headed to Capitol Hill for the  next two days, the testimony coming amidst criticisms over trade policy and  its effect on the economy.  Powell will speak with the Senate today and  testify in front of the House, tomorrow.  </p><p>Futures currently look like this, this morning, take a look at markets,  down across the board.  Dow Industrials down about 20 points, S&amp;P 500 down  five points, and the NASDAQ given up 20 points as well.  Yesterday, the  major averages finished, mixed, but little changed with the Dow Industrials  picking up 45 points on the session at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are near the flat line, again, negative  tone here, FT 100 down 13 points, CAC Quarante down 20 points, and the DAX  Index in Germany, down 23.

Center field and Bryce Harper has thrown his bat  in the air and won the 2018 T-Mobile Home Run Derby.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of all the highlights, coming up this morning, right here.   And then, call the fashion police, hurry, we've got the internet's reaction  to high heeled Crocs, later this hour.  All those stories coming up, but  first, our top story this half an hour, the immigration debate takes center  stage, customs and border protection reporting that the National Guard's  deployment to the southwest border, accounting for more than 10,000 arrests  of illegal immigrants since mid-April.  </p><p>This comes as the House prepares to vote tomorrow on a resolution to  support ICE, Immigration Enforcement Agents.  Joining me right now is Fox  News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the push to deploy troops to the border was hit with a lot  of backlash at first.  But these numbers are revealing that there's a lot  of wrong-doing and is it working?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  It absolutely is.  I mean, the problem we have is, we got an  open border.  We don't have enough border agents to patrol that border.   And the President, rightfully so, with his advisors, had decided to build a  wall to compensate for that problem.  And in the absence of increasing that  wall, we have about six, 700 miles of it and some of that's not as good as  it should be.</p><p>And we need the equivalent of that to complete.  Moving the National Guard  down there, makes a lot of sense, they're not necessarily directly involved  in the apprehension, but they are involved in surveillance and with  helicopters, with other ISR platforms, intelligence surveillance platforms,  excuse me, and also providing backup to the border patrol and duties that  free them up so that they can do the apprehension.</p><p>So, I think it's a very good decision and an appropriate role also for our  National Guard guys.  I know they feel a sense of purpose in doing  something like this and it certainly is in their job profile to be able to  accomplish this mission.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And House GOP leaders are scrapping a vote on the Democratic  measure to abolish the Immigration Customs Enforcement Agency after the  bill's author said their colleagues would vote against it.  What began as a  Democratic campaign against the President's hard line immigration policy,  now looks like it could be dividing the party.  What's your take on this?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, some of it is just so factually wrong, I mean, ICE is not  involved at the border, the border patrol is.  ICE did not separate  children from their parents.  The border patrol folks did that because  that's their duty.  </p><p>ICE is involved in duties away from the border in apprehending illegal  immigrants who are in our country and gang members and also drug cartels,  and the duties that they perform, I think, are absolutely necessary in this  country if we're going to maintain a rule of law and help police these  neighborhoods that are sometimes swamped by gangs and druggies.  </p><p>So, yes, it makes no sense to me whatsoever.  And the fact that it's  dividing the party, I'm delighted to see that, not because I necessarily  want the Democratic Party divided or any party divided, but certainly, the  contrarian view that exists within that party makes sense.  That ICE is  providing a vital service and we certainly -- what are we going to replace  it with and why go through the change?  It makes no sense to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, but, you know, Kevin McCarthy and his colleagues  are basically calling the Dems out, now we know this was just about  politics.  He says let's bring it to the floor, let's vote on it.  And now,  you know, it's clear that it was all politics.</p><p>KEANE:  Well, certainly, yes.  That's -- it's a legislative body and the  way they express their views is, in a vote, and that's probably the right  thing to do.  The good thing is ICE is not going to go away.  They're going  to go out there and continue to provide a function in terms of protecting  the American people and that function is vital.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you about this.  This is an interesting story,  military spending is up but the defense workers are in short supply.  A new  story in the New York Times published, yesterday, that global defense  spending is set to hit the highest level since the end of the Cold War, yet  defense industries are struggling to actually fill the job openings, your  reaction?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, yes, there are challenges there.  One, in the numbers because  we have close to full employment in the country, and two, in terms of the  type of positions that we need.  There was a time when engineers and  scientists were drawn to the United States military and also to NASA  because we were at the cutting edge of technology.  </p><p>The reality is, a lot of youngsters in school today are drawn to the  software industry, to the telecom industry, because they believe that is  the cutting edge and certainly some of the compensation is likely  considerably larger than what you're going to find in NASA or working for  the Department of Defense.  But I also think it's more than a comp.  I  think they like the fact they're on -- they're on this cutting edge and  change is very dynamic.  It happens within two or three years at worst.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  And sometimes within six months to a year.  And that's pretty  exciting to work around all that.  But, in the defense department, we still  have the largest number of PAC mathematicians in the world.  And they're  there because of the sense of purpose and every single day, they feel good  about what they're doing.  Most of them are in the National Security  Agency.  </p><p>And they're helping to protect the American people.  And once somebody  signs up to do that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  I'll tell you what.  It has profound impact on your life.  It makes  you feel good about what you're doing.  Your family gets wrapped up in it  as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you before you go, General, about Russia,  after that press conference and the President's trip.  What does the  President need to do now in your view to stand firm and tough against  Russia, given it is a bad actor?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, the summit, we don't really know what happened  at the summit.  Although we've got some insights as a result of the two  interviews after the press conference, both of which were on Fox.  And that  gave us insight to be sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The press conference, I think, was an absolute distortion  because the President struck a consolatory almost appeasement tone of  Putin, which is in stuck contrast to his policies --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  which are largely of confrontation, and you know, the defense  build-up, deploying troops in Eastern Europe, strengthening NATO's budget,  attacking his stooge, Assad, twice, for the use of chemical weapons,  killing almost 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria when they led an attack  against U.S. led coalition forces and all the sanctions.  </p><p>So we've got a tough policy on Russia that is very different than Obama's  policy.  But yet, that was not the expression at that press conference.   And the President's got to correct the mistake about he made certainly with  not backing up his intelligence community which truly has the goods on  Putin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  And Putin has got to be strongly confronted on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a really important point, though, the actions and the  policies have been tougher than people expected and certainly just days  before meeting with Putin, he's over there questioning the gas deal with  Germany.  So there you go.  I mean, poking holes in that business.   General, good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, BlackRock betting on  Bitcoin, we've got the I&amp;J numbers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, beating expectations  with a profit of $2.07 a share on revenue of $20.8 billion.  BlackRock is  taking a closer look at blockchain and cryptocurrency.  Some are asking  what this endorsement means for upstarts like Bitcoin.  And then, Crocs,  growing up, the shoe known for its comfortable appeal, getting a high heel  and a high price tag, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A manhunt is under way in North Carolina this  morning after a sheriff's deputy is shot during a traffic stop.  Cheryl  Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, unidentified deputy is out of surgery after he was  wounded on Sunday night.  The sheriff's office says the suspect took off  from the scene after shooting the deputy just below his bulletproof vest.   Investigators are not releasing a motive for that shooting at this time.  </p><p>Meanwhile, some incredible video of a cop in Las Vegas, shooting through  his windshield during a chase with two homicide suspects.  This is Officer  William Umana, returning fire after the suspect shot at him 34 times.  Cops  eventually were able to surround the car after it stopped.  One of the  suspects was killed in the shootout.  The other, was arrested.  Wow! </p><p>All right.  Well, let's turn our attention now to Blackrock.  They are  dipping their toes into cryptocurrencies.  CEO Larry Fink says he's  assembled a working group to look at block chain technology and  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but, Fink says, there is no investor demand  at the moment and Blackrock is only studying it to see if cryptos can  actually become legitimate.  Unlike Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase,  Blackrock doesn't have the infrastructure to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.   Shares of Blackrock down about one percent for the year.  </p><p>And then, this is pretty interesting.  Crocs is stepping up with a new  sandal.  There were furry crocs, crocs with tube socks, now they come with  heels.  Crocs are popular because they're comfortable.  High heels may seem  to go against that.  But they claim that they have combined comfort and  style, and you'd have to pay for that comfort.  The new heel version sells  for a whopping, get this, $224 a pair.  Maybe the company is onto  something.  They're actually almost sold out, Maria, on Amazon.  Up to you  if you think you would like to sport a pair of those.  I'll send it back to  the panel for that one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I do love crocs but I don't know about the high heels.   Dagen, what do you think?  You have those high-heel pumps on from Crocs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you buy those, you should be forced to wear them with tube  socks.  That's how bad they are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's comfortable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what's really comfortable?  Tennis shoes, running  shoes, those are comfy cozy.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Some people are a little more comfortable in heels, at least  small heels, than flat shoes?  I'm out of my element here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Please.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's the great reveal, Jon.  No.  Women would much rather be - - I'm just kidding.  Why do we wear heels?  </p><p>BELL:  They're uncomfortable but they look really good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why do I wear heels?  Because I'm as small as Vladimir Putin.   That's why I wear high heels.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do not compare, Dagen.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Are you saying Vladimir Putin should be wearing heels?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's probably wearing lifts, I would guess.  He has a small  person complex, I think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Bryce's hot bat.  Washington Nationals' right  fielder, Bryce Harper, pulling off a dramatic home run derby win last  night.  Then, an NFL star from New Orleans becomes a real-life saint,  saving the life of a man in a parking garage.  Wait until you see this.   Sports, is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exciting finish last night at Major League Baseball's home run  derby.  Jared Max with all the details and the highlights, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   Our nation's capital is hosting the all-star game festivities.  Washington  Nationals all-star, Bryce Harper, last night in the finals against the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  And with Bryce Harper's father, Ron, pitching to  him.  Bryce hit nine home runs over 10 pitches.  He came back from lying  down against Schwarber, forced bonus time and would win it on the second  swing of the bonus round.  Final score: 19-18.  Bryce, the champ.  Mid- summer classic tonight, 8:00 Eastern Time on Fox.  Third year in a row  Chris Sayle, the American league starting pitcher, a second straight year  for the Nationals' Max Scherzer.  And no, the winner of this game is no  longer grants home field in the world series.  </p><p>Minnesota Twins pitcher, Fernando Rodney, has a new home.  He hadn't  entered any game before the sixths innings since 2005.  Sunday, though, his  manager got him in for a couple outs in the fifth inning so Rodney could  catch a flight to Miami for his immigration hearing Monday morning.   Fernando Rodney, welcome to the United States.  He wrote after 19 years in  his wonderful country: \"Today, I am blessed to say I'm an official U.S.  citizen.\"  Rodney wrote on Instagram today, I fly the American flag, but in  my heart, I always hold the Dominican flag.  </p><p>We never know an opportunity may strike to save somebody's life.  Mitchell  Loewen of the New Orleans Saints did not wait to be called, he stepped into  action when he what he said sounded like a bomb or an earthquake shattered  into his Sunday on a parking garage in downtown New Orleans.  Loewen, who  was with his wife and his young son, found a man trapped in his vehicle  after it crashed through the fourth floor of the parking garage.  He told  the New York Times Picayune, there were a bunch of people standing around  but no one was doing anything.  He says, \"I was like, let's help this guy.\"   The man's legs were pinned down by the car, stuck in the passenger seat.   He called a bunch of people to help.  Eventually they ripped one of the  doors off its hinges and helped save the man.  In the end, he said, I just  did what I had to do and wasn't thinking about anything else.  Big ups to  Mitchell Loewen of the Saints.  </p><p>BELL:  It's amazing on situations like that when there's a million people  around, and no one does anything.  </p><p>MAX:  Waiting for somebody else.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, everyone's waiting for the next person to do it.  And he  stepped up.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Hey, how about Bryce Harper, is going to get hurt now?  I  mean, it seems when these guys do the home run derby, they end up not doing  very well on the weeks or months after that.  </p><p>MAX:  They train to hit home runs for this.  And all those home run swings  that they take over the course of one night, is probably about three, four  weeks-worth of home run swings.  So, I know they always say, oh, the stats  don't add -- no, the stats actually show -- I'm a Yankees fan.  I saw what  it did to Aaron Judge last year (INAUDIBLE) the derby.  We've seen it with  others.  We'll see what happens in Bryce Harper's second half.  He's only  (INAUDIBLE) two-fourth --  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  He's not having a great year to begin with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In baseball, that's the physical exertion of about two minutes  of play on the gridiron in football.  So, let's cry crocodile tears for the  baseball players.  </p><p>MAX:  Dagen's hosting the all-star party tonight.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll still watch baseball, occasionally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You hate baseball.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just -- professional baseball.  I like little league.  I like  amateur, college, just not pro.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff, Jared.  Thank you.  Jared Max.

We're taking a look at the numbers and the growth story at  Netflix.</p><p>Rolls Royce meanwhile taking to the skies, the company unveiling its plans  for a flying taxi.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath, and CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be  here.</p><p>BELL:  I think earnings -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Donald Trump.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  What -- earnings and Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly right.</p><p>What's your take?  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I can't get over the disconnect between how he treated our  European allies on this trip last week and how he treated the Russians.   You know, it just has me wondering once again, where is this trade conflict  going?   And what are the Russians thinking?  What are the Europeans  thinking when they see him attacking Merkel and May and then going and kind  of soft pedaling on Vladimir Putin?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fair point, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you addressed this because we were talking about the \"Wall  Street Journal\" editorial on this at the top of the last hour.  You quoted  from it, \"The Trump first\" doctrine.  And the \"Journal\" suggests will  leaders of other countries decide that working with President Trump is more  dangerous than fighting him.  Again, when you see him potentially turn on  somebody like Prime Minister May.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is having a hard time separating what took place  with Russia undermining the west, which has been the case for a long time,  and these allegations of collusion.  And I think that because of that, he's  unable to admit that, of course, Russia has been undermining the west for  decades.  He needed to be firmer in this press conference, for sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we will talk about this in about a minute but the people on  the left who already hate the President have become completely unhinged and  we'll have some evidence of that.  But that's equally appalling, in my  mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  We'll get to it.  We've got a lot coming up this  morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, the CEO of Microsoft is here, Satya Nadella  addresses a number of issues including growth at Microsoft and also  immigration, privacy, and trade with China.  Former deputy defense  secretary Paul Wolfowitz is here as well along with former senior adviser  to the Clintons Stagwell Group president Mark Penn.  The Eurasia Group  president Ian Bremmer is with us, and of course, the host of \"VARNEY AND  COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a jam-packed two hours coming up</p><p>But first our top story this hour, social media taking the Hill today.   Executives from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will face members of the  House Judiciary Committee over their business practices including the  censorship of certain voices as well as political bias and the filtering  practices of these companies.</p><p>Here now is Liz Peek, a FoxNews.com columnist and a contributor for \"The  Hill\".  Liz -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FOXNEWS.COM:  Thank you.  Glad to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to hear from these companies today?  We know  that they're -- that Congress is looking at the way they possibly censor  conservative ideas.  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, I don't think we're going to hear anything particularly  definitive probably.  We have been through several stages of the Facebooks  and Googles affirming that they have a balance and so forth.  But every  time they do a sort of review of their followers and participants it  basically eliminates a lot of conservative voices.</p><p>So honestly, I don't -- I'm not sure they're going to come up with a plan  that really satisfies everyone's umbrage about this.</p><p>And by the way, it's well-placed.  I mean this is really not -- this is now  a utility in a sense in our country and I think it's time for these  companies to begin to act like they're serving the public good and not  special interest.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A couple weeks of ago you could have Googled GOP agenda and you  got back Nazism.</p><p>PEEK:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did that happen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had a conversation though with an executive, a private  conversation with an executive out in Silicon Valley about this very issue  and the individual dismissed it.</p><p>And it was -- it's the view from the Valley and the technology industry  that this is not active censorship.  It's just automated.  It's just the  way it is in terms of the Russia interference.  Maybe they were careless in  policing the activity on these -- in terms of ad placement, the content  that's being censored but it's all automated.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's done by algorithm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They said it's done by algorithm.</p><p>PEEK:  It may be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but that's the attitude -- </p><p>PEEK:  -- but someone's writing the algorithms, right.  Someone is putting  in those key words that trigger a response from the algorithm.  So there  are humans behind all of this.  There's no denying that.</p><p>Look, actually my issue with social media companies today is protecting  people.  I mean we're talking a lot about privacy.  But very rarely are we  really talking about the fact that people are being scammed on these  organizations daily.</p><p>Google has Web sites up that they feature that are fraudulent.  I mean that  seems to me a much bigger issue for Americans and for consumers than  whether my date of birth gets, you know, bandied about.  I don't care.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But from a libertarian perspective, even a conservative  perspective there, it used to be buyer beware.  It used to be personal  responsibility, that it's not up to the government and Big Brother down in  Washington to protect these individuals, that you have to have a better  sense about someone taking advantage of you.</p><p>And that seems to have fallen by the wayside a little bit with the way that  conservative thought has morphed in recent years.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How much of this imbalance is driven by audience?  So the  audience using social media and the Internet frankly is probably more  urban-oriented, kind of less rural, suburban-oriented which is the base for  conservatives and Republicans whereas the urban audience is kind of more  liberal and Democratic.  Is that what's kind of driving the way this -- </p><p>PEEK:  I don't know that that's true.  You don't know my Twitter followers.   They are definitely, you know, out there somewhere and I love them.  But  let's face it.</p><p>Who is the biggest Twitter user in the country?  President Trump -- right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Fair point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>PEEK:  So that's Twitter, mind you.  That's not Facebook.  I don't know  actually what he does on Facebook.  I don't follow that much.</p><p>But I'm not sure that that's accurate.  I think it's a pretty balanced  thing.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Ok.  Fair point.</p><p>PEEK:  And when they go awry, when Twitter or Facebook begins to do  something disadvantageous to conservative voices it lights up like a, you  know, Christmas tree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when I spoke with the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, I  asked him if he's expecting -- if he's expecting more regulation as a  result of all of this.  He also talked about the benefits of artificial  intelligence and facial recognition -- </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and potential bias.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADELLA:  One of the things that we recognize is with A.I. technology, with  all the benefits comes some unintended uses, like bias or facial  recognition.  And so therefore we're very clear that we will not  participate in any project that is going to be against, you know,  fundamental human rights.</p><p>And in this case what we're doing with ICE is to support them in the core  infrastructure around e-mail.  But we're not at all involved in any of the  facial recognition technology and their use cases.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where does this go -- Liz?  Do you think we are going to see a  bill come to the floor, discussion about potential new regulation  overseeing tech?  </p><p>PEEK:  Well, I think we're going to follow the E.U. probably.  They have  really sort of been the forward guard on trying to rein in these companies.   Of course they don't have a vested interest there.</p><p>They would love to see our tech companies come under a cloud and be kind of  reined in a little bit because they want to compete with our tech companies  and they really can't at this point.</p><p>I think we'll see some talk about regulation.  There will probably be  around the edges -- by the way, if Facebook continues to have eruptions of,  gee, we forgot to tell you we were doing this and, yes, we agree that we  had taken all that stuff down but we actually haven't, I think they are  going to get into, you know, more serious challenge from regulators.  At  this point, I don't think there's that much appetite for it, frankly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Microsoft, frankly all these new-fangled technology CEOs should  be calling the former guys even a Ballmer or a Gates because Microsoft was  sued, we should remember, 20 years ago this past May by the Justice  Department and state attorneys general over its operating system monopoly  and then them trying to get a monopoly in the Internet Explorer.  It seems  kind of funny now that that was an anti-trust suit.  But they fought that  battler here and abroad. BARTIROMO:  And many people will say the bigger you get the more of a  target you are for government which is why Google left behind Microsoft -- </p><p>PEEK:  Sure.  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- 20 years later.</p><p>Let's talk President Trump returning from Helsinki.  He returned to the  United States last night from Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir  Putin obviously the meeting there.  The President speaking with Fox News'  Sean Hannity, noting the progress made with his Russian counterpart on  conflicts around the world, notably Syria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, I think on Syria we're  getting very close.  I think it's becoming a humanitarian situation and a  lot of people are going to move back to Syria from Turkey and from Jordan  and from different places.  They're going to move back, less so from  Europe.  But they will be moving back from lots of different places.  So I  really think we're not very far apart on Syria.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think -- Liz?  Does the President need to work  with Russia to solve issues like this?  What did you think of the post- summit press conference that we've been talking about this morning?  </p><p>PEEK:  Ok.  So I think I'm the only person who didn't completely bash  President Trump for his performance in the press conference.  Let us agree  he did not do well.  He said some things he should not have said.</p><p>But I think one of the great failings was he did not explain why it was  that we have Syria in common, why it was it's important to meet with  Russia.  You know, we don't know what they talked about for two hours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>PEEK:  When he came out and made conciliatory -- and some people would say  obsequious -- gestures to President Trump -- I mean President Putin, we  don't know whether he was trying to protect some agreements that had been  made in that very long two-hour, one-on-one confab.</p><p>The point is there are issues that we have in common-- obviously Syria.   Trump wants to get out of Syria.  He needs to have Russia step in and make  Iran go home so they then with Israel can protect Israel's borders.</p><p>There's no surprise to me that Netanyahu talked to Trump the day before the  summit and visited with Putin three days before the summit.  There are lots  of things -- North Korea; we need to work with Russia on North Korea.</p><p>The point is, Trump never really -- he's not the most articulate man in the  world, heaven knows.  He did not really make the case why we need any kind  of partnership at all with Russia.  And I think that was a grave issue.</p><p>I personally do not think that you come to a summit with all the  arrangements, all that's at stake, walk out on a global stage and call the  other person a liar to his face.  I think that would have been a ridiculous  thing and I'm really -- I was shocked that everybody expected him to do  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And even though I agree that the President needed to be  firmer as we've discussed earlier in the show, you also have to consider  the actual policies coming out of the Trump administration.</p><p>PEEK:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you actually look at the policies against Russia-- troops,  you know, Syria, the attacks on Syria, poking Germany for its deal with  Russia -- so the policies are much different than what we saw on display  yesterday.  </p><p>PEEK:  That's exactly right.  He sent military grade weapons to Ukraine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PEEK:  He basically -- in calling out Angela Merkel and the Nord Stream  pipeline, he's totally right.  Obama was very reluctant to ramp up LNG  exports.  That was the single biggest geopolitical confrontation we could  have had with Russia.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we used to -- for eight years used to get upset, I did, when  President Obama would go overseas and in front of a foreign audience -- </p><p>PEEK:  True.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- would essentially apologize for American behavior and act like  we as a nation don't have moral superiority and we are the problem -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apology tour.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and that's what happened.  That's what happened in the last  week and that's why a lot of people are upset.  </p><p>PEEK:  And I think that's totally right.  He should have been supportive of  our intelligence agencies.  And we can all acknowledge Putin is a thug, ok.   But I think the reaction was over the top.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what the best thing he could do right now get that  deal -- </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for Europe.  Get that gas -- start selling gas and oil to  the Europeans.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Liz -- it's great to see you.</p><p>PEEK:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much -- Liz Peek.</p><p>Be sure to tune in for my full interview with Satya Nadella 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  We'll talk about Microsoft and privacy, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>MGM Resorts suing victims of last year's Las Vegas shooting.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with more -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.</p><p>MGM Resorts filed the lawsuit against more than a thousand victims of the  shooting.  MGM is arguing in the suit that it isn't liable for any injury  or death, saying the resort took all necessary precautions approved by the  Department of Homeland Security to protect against the attack.</p><p>Remember back in October, Stephen Paddock opened fire on a concert crowd  from the window of the 32nd floor Mandalay Bay suite.  And attorney who  represents some victims is accusing MGM of judge-shopping.  Quote, \"I've  never seen a more outrageous thing where they sue the victims in an effort  to find a judge they like.  It's really -- just really sad that they would  stoop to this level.\"</p><p>Fifty-eight people were killed in that shooting that left more than 850  people injured.  Shares of MGM, they're down about 7 percent so far this  year.</p><p>Well, a wildfire in the Yosemite National Park nearly doubling in size --  that fire, now spreading to nearly 9,300 acres leaving a blanket of smoke  hanging over much of Yosemite Park.  Just 2 percent of the fire has been  contained.  One official says it could become a major threat to Yosemite.   And investigation is under way after one firefighter has already died  battling that blaze.</p><p>Well, Adidas likes being green.  The company is expanding its use of  recycled plastics, promising to eliminate virgin plastic in its stores and  its clothing by 2024.  This will save an estimated 40 tons of plastic  annually, they say.  Adidas the latest global company to pledge to reduce  plastic use.  Starbucks plans to eliminate plastic straws from all of its  stores.  We should say that shares of Adidas up 10 percent for the year.</p><p>And then Apple rolling out 70 new emojis ahead of today's start of World  Emoji Day.  This is always my favorite day.  The new characters include  redheads, lobsters, and cup cakes.  There's even a new emoji for bald  people and of course people with gray hair should not be left out.</p><p>There's no word on just when the new batch of emojis is going to actually  be released but Apple says that they're going to be part of an update to  iOS 12 after it is released in the fall -- so sometime in the fall.  Shares  of Apple are actually lower in the premarket -- a little more than half a  percent.  I love emoji day.</p><p>Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy World Emoji Day.  I love it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  After that Putin-Trump press conference yesterday, I searched -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For an emoji? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for an hour for an emoji to perfectly capture how I felt.  So  I just said -- I expressed myself in no way, shape or form, other than re- tweeting a couple of things, I just said nothing.  There's no upside in me  saying anything. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No words.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will take a break.</p><p>Coming up, the search for answers -- house lawmakers are questioning Lisa  Page for a second day following testimony from FBI agent Peter Strzok.  How  did the testimony yesterday go?  Apparently there's big differences between  what Lisa Page said and what Peter Strzok said about the texts.</p><p>Then Netflix earnings disappointing investors but the streaming giant is  delighting \"Stranger Things\" fans with a new trailer.  We've got your  Season Three sneak peek, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now to a story we've been following closely, Peter Strzok and the FBI --  President Trump calling out Obama in an interview with Sean Hannity,  alleging possible involvement between his predecessor and the disgraced FBI  agent.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  You know, you have to find out who did Peter Strzok report to  because it was Comey and it was McCabe but it was also probably Obama.  If  you think that Obama didn't know what was going -- when you watch, and I  said it today with President Putin, when you watch Peter Strzok's  performance -- the lover of Lisa Page -- when you watch that performance,  the FBI -- I'll tell you I know so many people in the FBI, these are  incredible people, what they're going through watching this guy, a total  phony.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now with reaction former senior advisor to the  Clintons, president and managing partner of the Stagwell Group and author  of \"Microtrends Squared\" Mark Penn is with us.</p><p>Mark -- great to see you this morning, thanks so much for weighing in.  </p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So your thoughts on what has taken place in terms of Peter  Strzok; what he has to say about his texts and now Lisa Page behind closed  doors.  What we're learning is there are some nuances where Peter Strzok  was saying I didn't mean this to mean Trump, I meant this as America and  Lisa Page behind closed doors apparently I'm being told she said oh, no, we  meant Trump.</p><p>What's your take on what we've learned so far from these testimonies?  </p><p>PENN:  Well, I think we've seen a series of witnesses here who have said  some incredible things.  I think Peter Strzok said oh, that's out of  context, I didn't mean that, it was in essence puffery.  I mean that's  ludicrous.</p><p>What we've learned, I think from reports, is that Lisa Page said yes, of  course I meant that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PENN:  And of course, what you didn't get from Peter Strzok's testimony was  how if I exhibited this kind of bias, I used meticulous procedures to make  sure that I acted appropriately.  You didn't hear that at all.  What you  heard was basically balderdash.</p><p>And remember, we've got here a series of witnesses.  You've got the former  FBI director who says I didn't make the decision on Hillary until after the  interview, when we have his memo written and edited before.  We have the  CIA director who says I didn't give the dossier to Senator Reid when  Senator Reid clearly knows what's in the dossier after he visits or talks  to him.</p><p>You know, you have obvious things here that are just untruths and you  really wonder why there's no action on any of this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You really do.  I mean I spoke with John Ratcliffe, the  congressman who basically has been seeing all the confidential and  classified material.  And, you know, he noted significant differences in  the two testimonies.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R), TEXAS:  What I can tell you is that Congressman  Gowdy and I had two hours to question her on Friday.  I can tell you that  there are significant differences -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RATCLIFFE:  -- in her testimony from Agent Strzok as it relates to these  text messages, what she thought some of them meant.  And she gave us new  information that he either wouldn't or couldn't that confirms some of the  concerns that we have about these investigations and the people involved in  running them.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Mark, one of the texts from Peter Strzok was \"Obama wants to  know everything we're doing in terms of the Trump-Russia collusion  investigation.\"  Is that enough to suggest that Obama was basically calling  the shots here?  ?</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think to say Obama is calling the shots is an overstatement.   I think it's pretty clear that folks in the Obama administration knew about  this investigation and wanted to preserve it, push it along, took all these  steps, made this report, spread the information all over the place.  I mean  that was clearly their intent.  Whether Obama directed that, no one will  ever know unless there is, in fact, an Obama deposition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think is going to happen here?  Are we going  to see accountability?  </p><p>PENN:   You know, there supposedly is someone in Utah that the attorney  general has tasked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- Mr. Huber. </p><p>PENN:  We've heard neither hide nor hair about Mr. Huber's investigation,  whether or not any of these testimonies will be brought to bear.  I am  seriously doubting we'll see accountability; I think the question is, will  we get this over fast enough.</p><p>You can see how this is weighing on the presidency, how it's affecting our  foreign affairs.  This investigation is not doing the country any good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think it affected President Trump's performance at that  press conference yesterday with Putin?  </p><p>PENN:  Oh, I've seen the stress with President Clinton that these  investigations cause.  And I have no doubt that the stress of that affected  it, that the timing of these indictments carried then over to be a central  issue here.</p><p>Look, I think Trump should have, you know, held firm on the indictments but  nevertheless, our foreign policy shouldn't be made by prosecutors.</p><p>Remember, Chinese were indicted for similar offenses in terms of hacking.   No one hectors the Chinese premier.  And the Chinese spent millions of  dollars in the Clinton campaign in 1996.  No one hectors the Chinese  premier.  Foreign affairs trumps this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's pretty extraordinary that, I guess, even at this  point the people who created this narrative are winning, because it's  tripping up the President because this whole narrative about collusion  which we are still waiting on any evidence -- I mean, look, the special  counsel, there were some rumors this weekend that he wants to close things  up by the end of the summer.  Do you think that's real?  Do you believe  that?  </p><p>PENN:  I think there's not a lot here left to investigate.  It sounds like  they're looking over Roger Stone very thoroughly.  But I think now we might  actually see an end to it.  This stuff that was in the indictments should  have been in a report rather than in indictments.  I think he's pretty much  at the end.  There's nothing else much here I doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And all of these people who were indicted, they will  never see justice.  They're Russians.  And they're back in Russia and  they're not going to really see accountability at all.  And they have  nothing to do with Donald Trump.</p><p>PENN:  And these are PR indictments but my problem is when they weigh on  the presidency -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.  </p><p>PENN:  -- when they in fact carry out our foreign policy, if we want to try  to wean the Soviets off of the Syria-Iran relationship which really could  bring peace -- this stands in the way of it.</p><p>Trump didn't maneuver this appropriately.  He should have acted  differently.  Nevertheless, that it should be our foreign policy objective.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, the problem started  with the appointment of Jeff Sessions as the attorney general of the United  States who immediately recuses himself.  And then he turns around and fires  James Comey which then in turned trigger the special counsel.  So, some of  this was the President's own making, quite frankly.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And the special council is  having cover for all these guys answering real questions.  Because anytime  they say we know Devin Nunes and his -- and his colleagues want to know  what was the evidence you had that you launched an investigation into  Donald Trump?  Where is this evidence of collusion?  But every time you  bring that up, they say this is an active investigation.  We can't discuss  it.  So, the special -- the special council cover for all these guys not  answering how they came up with this narrative of collusion.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  So, Mark is it your view  that there was Russian interference but there wasn't collusion?  </p><p>PENN:  Well, I think there has been now evidence of Russian hacking but no  evidence of collusion.  So, that evidence hasn't been tested but its real  evidence.  </p><p>And I think the most interesting thing in the evidence was the e-mail that  said Donald Trump has a 25 percent chance of winning.  We should play up  this conflict between Sanders and Hillary, thereby showing that this was  just an effort to disrupt things in America, not really to tilt the  election one way or the other, that their idea was her maximum disruption  of America.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, what should the President be doing when there's  interference but not collusion, how should he be handling that situation?  </p><p>PENN:  He's got to -- he's got to have a calmer reaction, not let it get to  him.  He's got to do his business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PENN:  The economy is humming.  Let the legal team handle the  investigation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PENN:  He should do the job of President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you, sir.  Thank you.  </p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Penn.</p><p>Coming up, terrifying video shows the moment a lava bomb crashes through a  roof of a boat in Hawaii, injuring tourists, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, July 17th.  Your  top stories right now, 7:34 on the East Coast.  </p><p>Breaking news, Goldman Sachs earnings are out.  They just hit the tape,  beating earnings and revenue expectations.  The company reported earnings  right now of $5.98 a share on revenue of $9.4 billion.  That is both above  the revenue estimate and above the earnings estimate.  Goldman Sachs shares  are up a fraction right now.  </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson also beat earnings and revenue expectations earlier.   We're breaking down all the numbers on J&amp;J and Goldman, coming up.  </p><p>Plus, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell is headed to Capitol Hill today.   The testimony coming in the concerns over trade policy and its effect on  the economy.  Powell will testify in front of the senate today and the  House tomorrow.  </p><p>Futures this morning looking lower.  We are expecting a lower opening for  the broader averages, just a fractional move.  But the Dow Jones Industrial  average down about 14 points, the S&amp;P 500 down three and the NASDAQ is up  by 10.5.  </p><p>Yesterday, the major indices finished mixed but little changed.  The Dow  Jones Industrial average was up about 45 points at the close.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, markets near the flat line.  And they are decidedly  negative.  FT-100 down a fraction, the CAC Quarante down about 20 points, a  third of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany down 16.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performance there as well.  Japan was the best  performer, up one half of one percent.  </p><p>Horror in Hawaii.  A lava bomb crashes through the roof of a tour boat,  injuring dozens of people.  More on the dramatic footage coming up this  morning.  </p><p>And an alarming study says urgent care clinics are over-prescribing  antibiotics.  The concerning -- the concerning side effects later this  hour.  </p><p>Keeping your children safe, we will tell you about one school district in  America that's installing pepper stray -- pepper spray canisters.  The new  safety measures coming up.  </p><p>And then there's this, Netflix misses its subscriber growth forecast in the  second quarter.  The earnings last night underwhelmed and now the stock is  down 12-2/3 percent.  The company -- as the streaming company unveil its  new trailer for the next season of \"Stranger Things\".  Details on the  company's push for more original content.  Their paying billions for  original content.  We've got all the details later this hour.  </p><p>Well, forget Rolls.  We're looking at Rolls-Royce's new flying taxi.  Wait  until you see this.  This coming up this morning.  </p><p>But first our top story this half an hour.  Futures trading in a tight  range today ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's trip to  Capitol Hill.  And after earnings from Goldman Sachs and all the banks last  couple of days.  </p><p>Joining us now to break it all down is business developer and entrepreneur  Tom Maoli.  Tom, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TOM MAOLI, BUSINESS DEVELOPER AND ENTREPRENEUR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we're focused on the Jay Powell testimony before the senate  banking committee.  Are you looking at anything in particular to come out  of this hearing (INAUDIBLE) tomorrow?  </p><p>MAOLI:  You know, listen -- you know, listen, it's a new sheriff in town,  right?  I mean, he's got his own policies.  Clearly he's a Trump guy and  it's going to be interesting where he goes and how he signals the street.   I think that's going to be the key as to how the markets react.  It's all - - it's going to be all about his signal.  I mean, listen, the economy is  humming.  He's got to watch where he moves these interest rates.  He's got  to hedge inflation.  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon Hilsenrath, what would be the main focus of the testimony,  from your standpoint?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think we're going to a see testimony that's  pretty close to what his press conference was a couple weeks ago.  And he  was very upbeat about how the economy's doing.  I think he's going to be  upbeat again today.  You know, we've had really strong numbers.  It looks  like we've got growth in the second quarter of four to five percent which  is really off the charts.  So I think, you know, you get Powell up there  and he's saying we're going to stay the course, we're going to keep raising  interest rates and I don't think there's really anything to slow them down  at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just don't know if it's going to be three or four.  I've been  of the belief that it's going to be three total this year.  I think four is  overdoing it.  Frankly, because we're never going to get possibly Dagen a  four percent number on GDP for the second quarter.  But we are expecting  things to slow down.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The GDP now from the Atlanta Fed is running and they change it  based on every data point that comes out, but it's running at 4.5 percent  growth for the second quarter that was updated yesterday.  </p><p>But Jon, we also have the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet which  is also a head wind for the economy or is meant to cool or prevent an  economy from overheating.  So that's maybe the reason we would get three  instead of four.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I think, I mean, the balance sheet is another important  issue that could come up.  And where the Fed is going on that is that they  might do a little less on the balance sheet than they had been expecting  because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  $50 billion a month is what they wanted.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  For technical reasons, you know, they had thought they need to  get it down a couple of trillion dollars.  But they might not need to.   Because they've got the interest -- they need to get the balance sheet down  to control of interest rates but they've got the interest rate where they  want it from a technical point of view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, they might not be doing a lot on that front.  </p><p>MAOLI:  I think the trade wars are going to cool things off.  I think the  trade wars are obviously -- you know, the balance of trade, it's going to  take a while to get that to move where we have all that economic growth  back to the U.S.  I think you're right with three percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm glad you mentioned the trade.  Because I mentioned this  with Kevin Brady, The Chairman of The House Ways and Means Committee on  Sunday and he said yes, we will see these tariffs cut into economic growth.</p><p>MAOLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Later this year.  He says yes, this will show up later this  year.  </p><p>MAOLI:  I agree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President's going meet with congress today at 02:00 p.m. to  talk about his tax reform 2.0 initiative.  He's expecting that to be  enacted by October.  </p><p>On Sunday, I spoke with Kevin Brady who laid out the plan and how he sees  tax reform 2.0 playing out.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does the economy need even more stimulus?  Are you looking for  phase two?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that and  it will be more of a middle class.  We did a lot for the middle class.  But  this would be even more aimed at the middle class.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and then for the most  part the rest of it would go right to the middle class.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, are you considering that, bringing the corporate  rate from 21 percent to 20 percent?  </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS  COMMITTEE:  So, we're working with the President on a number of those  issues.  And we, I think the key point here is President Trump's tax cuts  and reforms was about changing the economic direction of the country for  the better.  2.0 is about changing the culture in Washington where we don't  wait 30 years between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we  continue to lead the rest of the world here.  </p><p>And so, you're going to see I think permanence of the middle tax cuts and  the small business cuts would be the center piece of this.  And people I  think overlook the growth impact long term.  That alone, could help create  a million and a half new jobs in America, continue to raise paychecks  significantly in the long term.  So, that will be the centerpiece of it.   We're working with the President on the rest of the elements of 2.0.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact, Tom, as an entrepreneur yourself?  Have you  seen a big impact from the tax (INAUDIBLE)?  </p><p>MAOLI:  Listen, there's a big impact.  It's clearly is consumers are --  have more money in their pockets full to spend.  The thing is that, these  don't hit day one.  They take time.  </p><p>You know, the trade tariffs take time.  The tax cuts take time.  There --  it has to roll into the economy.  I don't see five percent this year.  I  see three.  I think next year's a better robust year.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  So, the people you're talking  to, business investments, you know, there's a lot of talk out there that  some CEOs are really like putting off and postponing spending because of  the potential for tariffs and trade wars.  Are you seeing that with the  people you're speaking to?  </p><p>MAOLI:  Absolutely seeing it.  I'm an inquire businessman, an enquired  dealer, a real estate developer.  I'm seeing it.  I was out golfing last  week with one of the executives from one of the major car companies in  German manufacturer.  They're scared, they're concerned.  They're putting  off investments, they're not building plans.  They have to figure out where  they go and how these tariffs are going to affect the ultimate cost of the  consumers' product.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, this is an uncertainty that's hanging over not just the  European auto manufacturers who employ tens of thousands of people in the  United States, but also the American car companies.  General Motors, Ford,  are deeply concerned about a 20 percent import tariff on imports, auto  imports into this country.  And that's going to really stick it to dealers  just like you.  </p><p>MAOLI:  Absolutely.  Listen, you know, it's going -- it's going to affect - - like I said, it takes time to roll through the economy.  I think Maria's  right.  I think three percent.  I think five -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three times.  </p><p>MAOLI:  Yes, exactly.  I think five is just way out of the ballpark.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAOLI:  I don't think it happens.  I think it's going to take time for  these.  The tax cuts are going to be big, the corporate tax cuts are big.   History has said, when you make corporate tax cuts it rolls into the  economy.  It allows corporations to open up their checkbooks and spend.   But the question is, where do they spend with these tariffs?  That's what  we're trying to figure out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out though, this is something the Trump  administration could just ice right now.  They could come out and say, you  know what?  We're not going to do this auto import tariff.  If people are  concerned, if business owners and operators and consumers are legitimately  concerned about what this would do to the American economy, we're just  going to table it.  And that's not happening.  </p><p>MAOLI:  We'll do it.  We'd all do it.  I don't see him doing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We see a lot of behavior in anticipation of tariffs.  What's  happening in autos right now in anticipation of that 20 percent?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's business?  Real quick.</p><p>MAOLI:  Business is off the charts.  Consumers have money, they're  spending.  But it's the manufacturers that are scared.  They don't know  where to put their resources and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAOLI:  And should it be U.S., overseas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uncertainty is real.  </p><p>MAOLI:  Uncertainty is real.  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MAOLI:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Maoli there.  And just to be clear, 4.5 percent growth in  the second quarter makes three percent growth for the year more likely.   We'll take a break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, get this.  A lava bomb comes crashing down on a  tourist boat in Hawaii.  Cheryl Casone with the shocking video now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, yes, that's right.  The  entire thing caught on tape.  A volcanic explosion sent the large rock  flying into this boat and it terrified the people on-board.  </p><p>So the basketball size lava bomb punctured a hole in the roof of the boat,  injured 23 people.  Four had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  One  woman seriously injured.  She suffered a fractured femur.  </p><p>This happened nearby where the Kilauea volcano continues to spill lava into  the ocean which is creating a new lava island at this point in time.  </p><p>Well, a new study calling out urgent care centers as the biggest offender  when it comes to over-prescribing antibiotics.  Research (INAUDIBLE) that  nearly half of the patients with cold symptoms or flu leave with an  antibiotic.  The U.S. Center Disease Control and Prevention says the  problem is that antibiotics don't work and could even be harmful.  The CDC  says that over-prescribing antibiotics could create super bugs that can be  difficult to treat.  </p><p>Well, an Ohio school district has taken new safety measures to guard  against school shooters.  Columbiana Exempted Village School District is  installing a special device called a Threat Extinguisher.  These device are  like fire extinguishers that can shoot pepper spray up to 30 feet.  They  also are connected to a communication system that does alerts police and  staff.  </p><p>School officials says that they met with parents before they decided to go  at it and install these devices.  </p><p>And then there's this, Rolls-Royce says it's designed an engine system for  a flying taxi.  In the design, the EVTOL can carry four to five people,  travel 250 miles per hour.  It's got wings and allows us to take off and  land vertically.  It uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity.   Rolls-Royce doesn't think it's going to have a flying taxi anytime soon.   But we all hope, because wouldn't that be fun?  We'll likely going to have  to wait until the early to mid-2020s to be actually hailing one.  </p><p>Shares of Rolls-Royce are up 16 percent year-to-date.  Although, the driver  training for air taxis, that's going to be an interesting story I supposed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  Boy, well, that -- I can't believe that  story, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.</p><p>What about Netflix, the stock has taken a dive this morning, guys?  We've  got to talk about the offering at Netflix and what happened here.  The  streaming giant posted a massive miss on subscriber growth and the stock is  down 12.5 percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yikes.  </p><p>BELL:  It was worse last night.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Netflix is not an island that everybody needs to be on any  longer.  There's Hulu, DirecTV NOW, there's HBO Go and then, what Disney  will eventually unveil.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Their sales are forecasting problem and not a business  problem.  That happened before -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on that, back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big upset for Netflix last night, missing big on  subscriber growth in the second quarter earnings report, spooking  investors.  Sending the stocks plummeting.  The shares are down almost 13  percent right now in the premarket.  </p><p>Some positives out of the report though, a brand-new trailer for the third  season of \"Stranger Things\".  Gerri Willis has all the details here, Gerri.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We'll get to the fun stuff  last, Maria.  A big disappointment for Netflix investors, the company  missing its own forecast by more than a million subscribers for the second  quarter.  Shares sold off 15 percent in afterhours trading.  And as Maria  just said, still down 12.5 percent.  The video streaming site blaming its  miss on faulty internal forecasting, and not on recent price increases.  </p><p>It is not the first time the company has had guidance problems.  Netflix  has missed forecasts three times in the past 10 quarters.  Netflix's CEO  Reed Hastings blaming a, \"Lumpiness in the business which makes it hard to  read.  Fundamentals have never been stronger.\"  He said, \"Our viewing is  setting year over year records, we're feeling strong.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, subscriber growth broke down like this.  Estimates of  international subscriber growth off by 530,000 and strangely U.S.  subscriber growth estimates also off by 530,000.  The company has 130  million customers worldwide.  </p><p>On the bottom line, Netflix reported a profit of $384 million or $0.85  cents a share on revenue on $3.91 billion and that my friends is a 40  percent jump.  The company set to spend up to $8 billion on content this  year.  And $4 billion on shows.  </p><p>Be sure to watch \"Sacred Games\", that's my own personal thing there.  One  of those shows, \"Stranger Things\", the 1985 by serial season three teaser  out now.  It promotes, and you're seeing the video right here, an imaginary  mall.  Remember malls?  Called star court complete with retailers like  Radio Shack, WaldenBooks, Sam Goody, don't hear too much about those  anymore.  No word yet on when the new season begins.  But I'm going to be  watching for Millie Bobby Brown, what happens to her.  She's my favorite  character.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right though, it's becoming a crowded field, right?  The  streaming business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one of the things -- a couple things that Netflix does have  going for it.  It has unique original content and the app actually works in  terms of streaming.  I have all of them and I have used all of them.   DirecTV NOW, which is still incredibly expensive, you're supposed to have  live programming.  I tried to watch Hannity's interview with President  Trump, it simply does not work.  When other apps work, that direct T.V. app  does not.  HBO app terrific but doesn't have as much content.  Hulu, they  kind of hood wink you into paying a lot more for live programming which is  a little sleazy.  But then you've got whatever Disney does with the  acquisition.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, and that's why they're rolling out so much content right  now.  You know, they got a 112 Emmy nominations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, that's incredible.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And it's not -- it's not just domestic content.   There's a lot of international content that they're rolling out.  The  number that you just reported that really strikes me is 130 million.  That  is the population of Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And when you think about the rest of the world that's out  there, it seems like there is still plenty of room for these guys to grow,  if they can create -- keep creating international content.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, that was interesting about that point.  The story -- pardon  me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  In the Wall Street Journal this morning, quoting Hastings as  saying, \"There's plenty of room for all of us.\"  And I thought, really, is  that really true?  But maybe it is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they're just glad that this other services just keep  screwing up in terms of the consistency of the stream.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of room for screw-ups.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They did make $100 million in earnings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's not forget.  The company's doing well but a lot of  expectation when your stock is where it is.  </p><p>Gerri, thanks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, Microsoft now teams up with Wal-Mart to take on  Amazon.  I'll sit down exclusively with Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella,  next hour.  Right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.

And in the case of Wal-Mart is a  good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need  today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're  increasing the momentum online.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  straight ahead.  Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street.  Three Dow  components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell.   Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out.  Goldman  Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the  New York Times.  The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know  the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs.  Markets this  morning look like this, futures edging lower.  The Dow Industrials now at  the low of the morning here down about 30 points.  The S&amp;P 500 down three  and the NASDAQ down 3-/2.  This after the markets finished the day mixed  yesterday.  Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P  and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p>And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  The FT-100  down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent.   And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.  In Asia  overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan,  Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent.  Amazon prime day will under way  but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making  purchases yesterday.  The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales  day of the year.</p><p>And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a  last second win at his home stadium.  We have all the highlights.  All  those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global  economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.  Great show so far guys.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  And earnings  are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  90 percent of  companies beating the bottom line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just for the second quarter.  </p><p>BELL:  Nine percent revenue.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  The estimates are for  earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not second quarter.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BELL:  the numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think the earnings period gets even better for the  second quarter?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Could be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to keep watching that.  We want to look  at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week.  It  is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon.  The retail giant looking to  accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud  technology.  I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his  take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where  Microsoft can continue to grow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>NADELLA:  The core mission of our company really comes through in the  momentum we have.  If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission  as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve  more.  In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on  our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world.  That's what you  see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and  others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a  strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but  you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity.  This transformation to  digital. </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes, it's actually frustration.  If we think about it for all the  success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP,  the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent.  It  is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years.  But the real question is,  what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent  of the GDP.  How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some  sense digital companies in their own right.  Whether it's any retailer like  Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look  to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience  innovation or cost savings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles  with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space.   Tell me about I.T. budgets today.  Are you seeing that increase in  technology spending?  I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax  plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was  worries that things have slowed down.  Are you still seeing I.T. budgets  increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?  </p><p>NADELLA:  No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it,  tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because  everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's  a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is  increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world.  Every  experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability.  So that's  what's going to keep driving more tax spend.  It's going to essentially --  I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being  digitized.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you  think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to  anything around off-line commerce.  But they're increasing their momentum  online.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the priority for companies today whether big or small,  because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and  midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the  world.  But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it  cloud?  Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I would say the number one priority is around productivity and  digital transformation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money  back to the U.S.?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach.  First and  foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating  expenses right here in the United States.  And if you look at what we do,  we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85  percent of it is right here in the United States.  And so we continue to  bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that,  whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did  earlier with Minecraft.  We are looking for assets that can complement what  we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks.  So, we think having that  approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various  different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important.  But at  at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the  innovation and growth in this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here,  someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies  in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it.   You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time.  What can you tell  us about it?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have  been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do  their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense  adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there.  I think  intellectual property needs to be protected.  I think it's China's own  interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators  themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is  protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the  Chinese government.  And I think the voices coming out of Washington are  all good which is we want fair trade between countries.  I believe that the  next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to  be defined by how the United States and China not only create an  equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our  I.P.  So how do you change that behavior?  Is there any way to stop that?  </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, for example as  we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual  property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think  every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and  socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a  certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for  protecting things like intellectual property.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people understand the issues around China  because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel  tariffs are something different.  Are you expecting an impact as a result  of these tariffs?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook.   The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is  based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and  how well you add work.  And I'm hoping that we'll come back.  I think the  President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as  we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text  base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica  scandal over at Facebook.  A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as  it relates to technology.  Are you expecting a new round of rules or  regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and  that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services.  And  the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it  in our products.  That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in  terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even  think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation.  It requires an  ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy.  And I think that -- I  fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United  States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have  done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and  Customs enforcements.  Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the  separation of families.  I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy  mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents.  Is there a potential for  using the facial recognition as well?  </p><p>NADELLA:  We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I  wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I.  technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by  set of enduring principles.  Now, one of the things that we recognize is  with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses.   Like bias or facial recognition.  And so therefore, we are very clear that  we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you  know, fundamental human rights.  And in this case, what we are doing with  ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are  not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their  use cases.  But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single  company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of  rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours.  Instead of us  trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should  govern the companies and their technologies and the uses.  That's what the  blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome  any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates.   And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we  are in sort of an uncertain term -- time.  When you look at A.I. and  machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are  making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it  is in fact infringing on our privacy.  There is that balance that  Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely correct.  When it will comes to things like  security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases  two things need to happen.  One is  companies like us at Microsoft, we need  to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things  like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord.  I think cover  as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world.  As well as have  ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I.  But on  top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going  into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you  like to see?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two  amazingly unique things,  American, one is American technology that reached  me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American  immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and  live that dream.  So I'll always come from that personal experience to  advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the  best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our  economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more  competitive globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that  you have open?  Recently we learned that there are more job openings than  actually people to fill those jobs.  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster  and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and  better talent.  Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I  think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United  States as well as in the industry.  So I think that yes, immigration,  policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing  that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, final question here, Satya.  Obviously you're doing a  lot, right?  How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion  market value from Microsoft right now? </p><p>NADELLA:  For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which  is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are  relevant in helping our customers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, it's great to see you today.  Thanks so much.  And  congratulations to you.  </p><p>NADELLA:  Thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced  that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning  October 1.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details looking at the stock.  Nicole, good morning.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the  succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the  Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out.  And so now, he is going to  take the helm on October 1st.  He will be the third Goldman CEO since it  went public in 1999.  Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be  treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David  Soloman.  Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st.   Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying  story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York,  and Bahamas.  Let's take a look also at the numbers.  You can see that the  stock is down about a quarter of a percent.  They did beat on profit and  revenue.  Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make  it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp  price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that  was a winner.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong  dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues.  And last but not  least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside.  The premiums missed  and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast  and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the  stock.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth.  Thank  you, Nicole.  Coming up.  Amazon prime day starts with a glitch.  Problems  with the retail giant's Web site.  Shoppers searching for deals later this  hour.  Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback.  The highlights  from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trade tensions escalating in the United States.   Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the  European Union.  This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S.  through  the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs.  Joining  us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO  Media.  Ian, great to see you this morning.  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Hi, Maia.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What progress is being made on the trade front?  Where are you  in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on  aluminum and steel?  </p><p>BREMMER:  So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in  place with the World Trade Organization.  The the good news is that for  those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going  around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the  United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress.   And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a  consensus in moving towards.  They are using the WTO as the allies are, as  China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established  multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to  be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Ian, it's Dagen McDowell.   The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential  tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent,  maybe higher.  They're looking at it right now.  I believe there is a  hearing even later this week.  Do you think that just ultimately gets  tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto  imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems  ludicrous.  </p><p>BREMMER:  Yes.  But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and  aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it.  So, I mean, the  fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking  to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to  pursue.  Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the  U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're  worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade.  And they  certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with  these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to  American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going  to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to  ask you about that.  The President goes to Europe and he calls the European  allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible  interaction with Putin.  How do you think America's European allies are  looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're  going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President  is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump  referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a  foe, Russia is also a foe.  So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a  better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around  the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of  everyone else.  Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the  allies.  So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite  the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem.  On the other  side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better  relationship with Putin.  It's also very clear he's not going to get one.   There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and  not with his advisories.  It's not because he was worried that the advisers  were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish.  Those  advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo,  Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right?  The issue is they  don't agree with him.  They have a harder line policy on Russia as the  Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in  that room.  U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are  harder line than they were under Obama.  U.S. defense spending is up.   Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO  or U.S. military activities in the Baltics.  He certainly didn't say we're  going to take U.S. troops out of Syria.  So as embarrassing as yesterday  was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage  and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to  recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the  Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it  was today. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians?  We did it  earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our  elections came out.  Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to  the sanction list?  </p><p>BREMMER:  I think we do.  I think that Congress will continue to move in  that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians  engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and  cyberattacks around the midterm elections.  Certainly in terms of  cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single  piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly.  It's the  one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two  countries.  Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are  not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where  most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year.  I  think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the  Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's  what Trump wants or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier.  Yes.  That's  a really good point, Ian.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p>BREMMER:  My pleasure, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see.  Ian Bremmer there.  Coming up.  President Trump  headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0.  We'll head to Washington,  D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your  top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast.  Trade tensions taking a  backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today.  Futures are  indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages.  It's  going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard  from three Dow components this morning.  In Europe, this morning, markets  are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right  around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and  the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed  performances there as well.  The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei  Average up half a percent.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch.

But, first, President Trump is putting  another round of tax reforms on the fast track.  Kristina Partsinevelos is  in Washington this morning with all the details.  Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   That is Tax Reform 2.0.  That's what they're calling it.  You have some  Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon.   What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts  that happened about a year ago.  What am I talking about changes?  They  were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent.   We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p>And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets.  You have those that  made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped  from 25 percent to 22 percent.  However, if you're also, you know, making a  little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6  percent to 37 percent as well.  So, both sides of the income brackets --  for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts.  The problem is  these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.  President Trump  weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that.   And it will be more of a middleclass.  We did a lot for the middleclass but  this will be even more aimed at the middleclass.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the  most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these  individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings  account.  There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses  can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to  offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn  workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income.  I know, Maria, you spoke  on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating  committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to  future growth in the American economy.  Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was  about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is  about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years  between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead  the rest of the world here.  And so, you're going to see, I think,  permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the  centerpiece of this.  And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long  term.  That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in  America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term.  So,  that will be the centerpiece of it.  We're working with the President on  the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it  permanent.  That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a  lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of  these tax cuts.  So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even  Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit.  They want to  push this forward before midterms as well.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you pay for it?  The question keeps coming up.   Kristina, thank you.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina Partsinevelos.  Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear  ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President.   President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States  deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.  Here's what the President told  Sean Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90  percent of the nuclear weapons.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  -- doing something and working on other countries.  And he also  said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with  North Korea, we have time.  There's no rush.  You know, it's been going on  for many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under  George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz.   Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be  with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many  years.  I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do  it reasonably quickly.  I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this  strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will  continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do then at this point?  I mean,  it was pretty historic that they met.  We thought that we would see more  progress.  Are we seeing progress?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It seems to me we're not seeing progress.  If anything, things  seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying  when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their  meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine.   There's something wrong there.  You know, in his own book, President Trump  wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk  away, otherwise you start to seem desperate.  And I worry that we may be  starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting,  and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except  the press conference.  But the press conference by itself is very  important.  And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to  say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he  even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster,  stronger than your little scotch terrier.  That's the kind of man he is,  and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President  Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with  someone like that is to be nice to them.  They just interpret that as  weakness.  </p><p>We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true.  We could do with a  better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between  Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having  Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting  was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes  you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin  dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another?  It doesn't bode  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met  with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita  Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  In Vienna in 1962, I think.  It was interpreted as Kennedy  being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile  crisis.  You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what do you think about the policies?  When you look at the  policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether  it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having  the gas pipeline deal?  When you look at the policies versus the  appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't  they?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  They are somewhat different.  They're not as different as they  might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the  President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and  in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need  more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate.  But I  think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know  about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep.  And the  U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge  pressure on Putin.  We ought to think about doing something like that in my  opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  Let me -- let me move over to the border  crackdown.  The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up  immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000  illegal immigrants just since April.  This comes as House GOP leaders are  set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE  agencies.  What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE?  I  mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  I think you've just said it right there.  We have to have  immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement.  I think  sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of  that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether  they are or not.  And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in  this handling of the children that we separated from their parents.  I  think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the  heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between  the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border  enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say,  what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally agree with that.  Let me ask you, Secretary,  look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms  of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You know there's a big difference between the risks right now  and the risks further in the future.  Further -- and I'm going to go  further in the future first because I think that is where China is  potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly  on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode.  And that's the reason, by the  way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we  can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which  is where they are now.  But I think in terms of immediate risks, North  Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones.  And I don't think we're  making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we  should be able to do.  So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy  probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the tougher policy?  Like, what would be the most  important policy this President could adopt?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic  sanctions.  It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their  policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do  that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous.  And we  went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past,  but I think there's still a long way that we could be going.  So basically  shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people  who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, really good point.  Ambassador, it's great to see  you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.   Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive.   Richest man in the planet.  The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of  the founder of Amazon.  Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the  highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for  primetime.  Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on  that.  Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hello, Maria, good morning.   I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for  upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for  Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about  three hours, Maria.  If you were trying to buy something, you actually  couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can  happen to a retailer.  Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which  was #PrimeDayFail.  But I want to let you know that statistically, it was  still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still  spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on  Prime Day this time last year.  So, you may wonder or for our viewers who  may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it  for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.  </p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy  Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year.  They also want  you to buy groceries.  They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing.  So, if you  show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a  grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than  $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well.  All of  this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO,  Jeff Bezos.  He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern  U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth.  The stock is up 55 percent  this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.  </p><p>So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft.  Jeff  Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff  Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away,  all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place.   But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the  answer untold but that takes a lot of money.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of  Jeff Bezos.  Pretty incredible.  Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching  Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next.  Can you believe that, you  guys, $150 billion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it.  Once  again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and  you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I remember, a half century  ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you  could live on the interest from the interest from your capital.  I suspect  that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on  the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress.  Look, I think that big  tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on  scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue?   That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.  </p><p>If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company,  they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because  they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers.  So,  there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road  or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride?  Very interesting  question today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little.   When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for  error.</p><p>VARNEY:  I hate expectations.  You know what I feel about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Join Stuart  top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby.  More of the highlights  next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fireworks at the home run derby.  Hometown hero,  Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for  tonight's all-star game.  Connell McShane with the details from Nationals  Park.  Connell?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, there, good morning,  Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead  of politics for a change.  89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be  tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it  here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals  playing in this city.  But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with  the home run derby.  Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce  Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he  came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana.  But I  got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  </p><p>Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in  the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the  pace.  He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board.  So,  Harper knew he had to make a good run at it.  He got off to a slow start in  the final.  When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't  get the rhythm.  Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run  derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got  going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two  hands in the air.  The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.  </p><p>So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game.  We'll see how  things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium  for the derby last night.  We'll have plenty more throughout the day  (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars  there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise  guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great coverage, Connell, thanks.  We'll be tune in.   Have fun, Connell McShane.  Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight  at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox.  Coming up, we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift.  This is a buying  opportunity.  They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I  think they will bode guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Even the stock is where it is.  All right, Jon  Hilsenrath?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing  sector.  10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in  great shape.  Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening  on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on  GDP, you said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now.  But  the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for  corporations, they're permanent.  Regardless of what the President says or  does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0  and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away  from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit.  It's  nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Thanks, everybody.  Great show.  Right to  Varney we go.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart.  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Just a day before the gathering began,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7b9542ed-b868-4ee5-9006-f0c2b74a010a\">UBS</url>issued a profit warning after its predominantly rich clients pulled $13bn of assets from the bank. </p><p>Here was Switzerland\u2019s largest bank and one of the top global wealth managers sending a distress signal from its own doorstep. The world\u2019s wealthy had apparently turned bearish on the economy because of geopolitical tensions and sluggish growth. </p><p>It proved to be a sign of things to come. The outlook for global banks has since only deteriorated. In September, the European Central Bank cut rates further into negative territory, putting extra pressure on banks\u2019 profit margins. The Federal Reserve cut US rates three times in 2019, reversing almost all of the increases implemented in 2018. </p><p>Moody\u2019s, the rating agency, cited lower rates as one of the main factors behind its decision last month to change its outlook for global banks from stable to negative. Driving this are\u2009\u201crising global trade tensions [and] lower for longer or lowering interest rates, depending on the jurisdiction\u201d, says Laurie Mayers, associate managing director at Moody\u2019s. </p><p>Ms Mayers adds that banks are operating with \u201cvery high cost structures\u201d that they are \u201cstruggling to bring down\u201d. Improving cost efficiency is particularly tough when banks are having to invest billions of dollars in new digital platforms to compete with fintech start-ups. The spectre also looms of Big Tech companies like Amazon and Google pushing further into financial services.</p><p>Other observers are less bearish. Analysts at Morgan Stanley recently turned positive on the European banking sector, though not because they predict a glorious period ahead, but rather because the worst might be over. </p><p>Magdalena Stoklosa, Morgan Stanley head of European banks research, notes that interest rates, in Europe at least, have probably reached their nadir. Few expect Christine Lagarde, the new ECB president, to implement further cuts.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are going to stay in this lower for longer structural backdrop and of course [profit] margins are going to be challenged,\u201d Ms Stoklosa says. But she adds that, given the sense that rates may go no lower, \u201cthe confidence in earnings is much higher than it was a couple of months ago.\u201d </p><p>Ms Stoklosa adds that in the third quarter of 2019, 80 per cent of eurozone banks managed to beat earnings expectations, albeit after they were revised lower by analysts. \u201cAnalysts have spent the last six months relentlessly cutting our earnings expectations for the banks, particularly for 2020. And I think we\u2019re done, or we\u2019re broadly there.\u201d</p><p>Signs suggest that global regulators think that banks have enough capital, after a decade during which lenders were forced to build their buffers to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crash. The higher requirements have dragged on profitability, while crimping the amount of excess capital that banks can return to investors by way of dividends or buybacks. </p><p>The introduction of new global rules on capital \u2014 commonly known in the industry as Basel IV\u2014 had raised fears that the buffers would have to be built further when the standards are implemented from 2022. But Randy Quarles, the Fed governor in charge of financial regulation, last month told a congressional panel that overall capital levels at US banks did not need to rise. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the aggregate level of loss absorbency needs to be increased,\u201d he said. </p><p>The ECB is tweaking its rules to make it easier for banks to use debt rather than equity to meet the requirements, giving banks more leeway when deciding whether to return capital to shareholders. The Bank of England last month said it would consult on reforms that would \u201cleave overall loss-absorbing capacity in the banking system broadly unchanged\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIt looks like Basel IV will be the biggest non-event in the history of capital regulation,\u201d says John Cronin, a banks analyst at Goodbody. </p><p>Even if some risks for banks do start to recede, however, there are new threats on the horizon. They include a surge in loans to highly indebted companies that could quickly fall into difficulty in the event of a recession and struggle to make their repayments. </p><p>Last month, the Bank of England warned that the global stock of \u201cleveraged loans\u201d \u2014 which tend to be made to highly indebted companies, especially those owned by private equity \u2014 had reached more than $3tn, a 30 per cent increase since 2015.</p><p>The threats associated with leveraged loans have not escaped the attentions of the organisers of this year\u2019s gathering in Davos. They have scheduled a session entitled \u201cThe Rise and Risk of Zombie Firms\u201d. The programme asks: \u201cWith cheap money keeping fragile companies on life support, will a recession cause a reckoning in corporate debt?\u201d </p><p>If the answer turns out to be an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d, bankers can count on more downbeat Davos gatherings to come.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f3f32262151f11eab8690971bffac109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-GH61-JB77-K45W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

U.S. and U.K. consumers rank PayPal and Amazon nearly as highly as banks for trust with their money, according to a Bain survey of banking customers in 22 countries.</p><p>In countries where the bank branch experience is more cumbersome, such as India and Mexico, 91% and 81% of respondents, respectively, said they would prefer to run their finances through major tech firms, while in countries that took an early start in digital banking such as the Netherlands, banks have protected themselves against the threat of competition from technology firms.</p><p>\"There is a level of self-inflicted pain that the banks are causing\" themselves, Eduardo Roma, a Bain partner, said in an interview.</p><p>'Eliminate friction'</p><p>\"In an environment where the competition has expanded and includes big tech firms as well as established start-ups, that can be a real threat,\" he said, noting that 80% of banking transactions are ranked by customers as either bad or avoidable.</p><p>Banks \"really have an imperative to eliminate a lot of the friction that exists to make the experience right first time, now that the bar has been reset.\"</p><p>The banking sector is going through huge change with the evolution of online and mobile banking, and the growth of specialized fintech firms and the foray of tech giants into payment services; Apple Inc.'s Apple Pay, Google Inc.'s Google Pay and Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Payments are altering the way people bank with online payment applications and digital banking services.

But cellphone companies may soon be trying to offer financial services of their own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, the country's largest cellphone carriers have begun to experiment with new financing options for smartphones and other devices. And that could be just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some cellphone carriers have already expressed interest in the fintech charter being developed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to Mark Atherton, the group vice president for financial services at the software firm Oracle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The wireless carriers have a lending relationship now with tens of millions of U.S. consumers,\" Atherton said. \"Extending into other lines of banking could become interesting.\" For instance, he said, \"they may pull in some deposits and have a digital wallet.\"</p><p>While no plans have been announced, at least one small cellphone company has publicly supported the OCC's efforts. IDT Corp., a lesser-known telecom company that specializes in servicing cheap phone calls through broadband internet, praised the OCC's fintech charter in public comments last year.</p><p>James Raanan, the firm's general counsel, argued that the separation of bank and commerce was an impediment to the advancement of fintech. (IDT already owns a money transmitter subsidiary in the U.S. and a bank licensed in Gibraltar.)</p><p>\"Refining these rules \" could open up the possibility of the special purpose charter to fintech companies with larger businesses that have other assets that can be brought to bear, but are not necessarily dedicated to financial services,\" he wrote.</p><p>The evolution of payment plans for smartphones over the last few years suggests wide interest within that industry. Just a few years ago, customers who did not want to pay upfront for a phone would typically enter a contract with their carrier which would roll the the cost of the device into their monthly bill.</p><p>But firms have moved away from that model, embracing installment loans. In 2013, T-Mobile announced the end of those contract payment plans. \"Stop the bullshit,\" said John Legere, the company's outspoken CEO. \"Do you have any idea how much you're paying?\"</p><p>The company began offering a zero-percent installment plan (with down payment), in effect de-coupling payments for the cellphone and network. Competitors soon began to follow suit, dropping their subsidized contract plans in favor of installment loans. Even manufacturers followed the trend. In 2015, Apple beganpartneringwith Citizens Financial Group in Providence, R.I., to provide 24-month installment plans for its iPhones.</p><p>But cellphone carriers could soon begin to expand the range of their financial products beyond installment loans for cellphones.</p><p>\"In the United States, we've had some of the telcos moving in the direction of broadening their offerings,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, a fintech consultant. \"I do think that they'll make a step towards credit and payment.\"</p><p>Cellphone companies today have every incentive to branch out into new business lines. \"What used to be core to their businesses - the network - is actually not a great money generator right now,\" said Atherton. \"They've really been forced to look for new sources of revenue.\"</p><p>They have already begun packaging their loans into securities. In 2016, Verizon announceda public saleof $1.2 billion in equipment installment loan-backed bonds.</p><p>And in many respects, they may already have a leg up on banks and other traditional financial firms. For one, they have access to a mound of data on consumers - including information on users' social media habits, their location and payments they make through their cellphones. By coupling this data with their record of monthly bill payments, cellphone companies could develop innovative underwriting models.</p><p>\"The telecommunications companies are pretty sophisticated with data,\" said Atherton. \"If you've established a payment history with them against your mobile phone plan, you've established a credit score.\"</p><p>Cellphone companies are also operating at lower costs when it comes to financial services since they don't have to deal with brick-and-mortar branches. Nor do they, as of yet, have to deal with the heavy regulatory load assumed by banks.</p><p>\"Lending is much less regulated than banking,\" said Barefoot.</p><p>Another advantage cellphone companies have is immediate collateral over their customers: disconnecting their phone lines.</p><p>\"They're going to pay their phone bills before they pay their car payments,\" said Atherton.</p><p>And they already have access to consumers that banks have had a hard time reaching. In 2015, 69% of unbanked households had access to a mobile phone, and 42.9% to a smartphone, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey. \"They've got their relationships already,\" said Barefoot.</p><p>ut even as installment lenders, the companies do have to comply with certain federal and state laws.</p><p>\"If you make a loan to a consumer, you typically need to have state licenses,\" said Lawrence Kaplan, a bank lawyer of counsel at Paul Hastings. \"It is not unusual for some entities to control captive financing companies.\"</p><p>T-Mobile, Verizon and U.S. Cellular all own lending and retail installment sales arms licensed in various states, according to a database maintained by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. (All three companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to queries).</p><p>Still, the companies are not subject to the same type of oversight as traditional financial institutions.</p><p>\"If you're not a bank,\" said Barefoot, \"you aren't being examined for it on a regular schedule like banks have.\"</p><p>But it remains to be seen whether the mobile companies be able to gain the trust of federal banking regulators.</p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is already watching cellphone carriers closely, a sign that such firms are an emerging player in the lending market. In 2015, the agency sued Sprint and Verizon for a total $120 million in redress fees, alleging the companies had allowed scammers to charge customers' bills without their authorization.</p><p>The CFPB hopes to go further. In its rule banning mandatory arbitration clause earlier this month, it asserted that mobile carriers are under its jurisdiction because by processing third-party bills, they engage in a form of lending or servicing.</p><p>Consumer groups have also accused cellphone carriers of deceiving their customers through their new mobile financing programs. In December 2015, a group called Change to Win asked the CFPB to pursue T-Mobile over its equipment installment plan, accusing the company of deceptive advertising and abusive debt collection practices.</p><p>\"T-Mobile's \"~no contract' marketing is misleading because a customer's cancellation of his wireless service before two years makes the amount remaining on the installment plan immediately due,\" the group said, \"a fee that is often larger than the penalties associated with early termination of a traditional two-year service contract.\"</p><p>New York's attorney general, who had also fined T-Mobile over its third-party bill-cramming practice, began investigating the company's \"no contract\" claim that same month.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the market forces pushing cellphone companies towards fintech appear irresistible. Around the world, they are already emerging as industry leaders.</p><p>In Kenya, nearly half of the country's GDP is now processed through the payment app M-PESA, which was launched by the cellphone company Safaricom roughly 10 years ago.</p><p>Cellphone companies and financial services have merged in developed countries as well.

But cellphone companies may soon be trying to offer financial services of their own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, the country's largest cellphone carriers have begun to experiment with new financing options for smartphones and other devices. And that could be just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some cellphone carriers have already expressed interest in the fintech charter being developed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to Mark Atherton, the group vice president for financial services at the software firm Oracle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The wireless carriers have a lending relationship now with tens of millions of U.S. consumers,\" Atherton said. \"Extending into other lines of banking could become interesting.\" For instance, he said, \"they may pull in some deposits and have a digital wallet.\"</p><p>While no plans have been announced, at least one small cellphone company has publicly supported the OCC's efforts. IDT Corp., a lesser-known telecom company that specializes in servicing cheap phone calls through broadband internet, praised the OCC's fintech charter in public comments last year.</p><p>James Raanan, the firm's general counsel, argued that the separation of bank and commerce was an impediment to the advancement of fintech. (IDT already owns a money transmitter subsidiary in the U.S. and a bank licensed in Gibraltar.)</p><p>\"Refining these rules \" could open up the possibility of the special purpose charter to fintech companies with larger businesses that have other assets that can be brought to bear, but are not necessarily dedicated to financial services,\" he wrote.</p><p>The evolution of payment plans for smartphones over the last few years suggests wide interest within that industry. Just a few years ago, customers who did not want to pay upfront for a phone would typically enter a contract with their carrier which would roll the the cost of the device into their monthly bill.</p><p>But firms have moved away from that model, embracing installment loans. In 2013, T-Mobile announced the end of those contract payment plans. \"Stop the bullshit,\" said John Legere, the company's outspoken CEO. \"Do you have any idea how much you're paying?\"</p><p>The company began offering a zero-percent installment plan (with down payment), in effect de-coupling payments for the cellphone and network. Competitors soon began to follow suit, dropping their subsidized contract plans in favor of installment loans. Even manufacturers followed the trend. In 2015, Apple beganpartneringwith Citizens Financial Group in Providence, R.I., to provide 24-month installment plans for its iPhones.</p><p>But cellphone carriers could soon begin to expand the range of their financial products beyond installment loans for cellphones.</p><p>\"In the United States, we've had some of the telcos moving in the direction of broadening their offerings,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, a fintech consultant. \"I do think that they'll make a step towards credit and payment.\"</p><p>Cellphone companies today have every incentive to branch out into new business lines. \"What used to be core to their businesses - the network - is actually not a great money generator right now,\" said Atherton. \"They've really been forced to look for new sources of revenue.\"</p><p>They have already begun packaging their loans into securities. In 2016, Verizon announceda public saleof $1.2 billion in equipment installment loan-backed bonds.</p><p>And in many respects, they may already have a leg up on banks and other traditional financial firms. For one, they have access to a mound of data on consumers - including information on users' social media habits, their location and payments they make through their cellphones. By coupling this data with their record of monthly bill payments, cellphone companies could develop innovative underwriting models.</p><p>\"The telecommunications companies are pretty sophisticated with data,\" said Atherton. \"If you've established a payment history with them against your mobile phone plan, you've established a credit score.\"</p><p>Cellphone companies are also operating at lower costs when it comes to financial services since they don't have to deal with brick-and-mortar branches. Nor do they, as of yet, have to deal with the heavy regulatory load assumed by banks.</p><p>\"Lending is much less regulated than banking,\" said Barefoot.</p><p>Another advantage cellphone companies have is immediate collateral over their customers: disconnecting their phone lines.</p><p>\"They're going to pay their phone bills before they pay their car payments,\" said Atherton.</p><p>And they already have access to consumers that banks have had a hard time reaching. In 2015, 69% of unbanked households had access to a mobile phone, and 42.9% to a smartphone, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey. \"They've got their relationships already,\" said Barefoot.</p><p>ut even as installment lenders, the companies do have to comply with certain federal and state laws.</p><p>\"If you make a loan to a consumer, you typically need to have state licenses,\" said Lawrence Kaplan, a bank lawyer of counsel at Paul Hastings. \"It is not unusual for some entities to control captive financing companies.\"</p><p>T-Mobile, Verizon and U.S. Cellular all own lending and retail installment sales arms licensed in various states, according to a database maintained by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. (All three companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to queries).</p><p>Still, the companies are not subject to the same type of oversight as traditional financial institutions.</p><p>\"If you're not a bank,\" said Barefoot, \"you aren't being examined for it on a regular schedule like banks have.\"</p><p>But it remains to be seen whether the mobile companies be able to gain the trust of federal banking regulators.</p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is already watching cellphone carriers closely, a sign that such firms are an emerging player in the lending market. In 2015, the agency sued Sprint and Verizon for a total $120 million in redress fees, alleging the companies had allowed scammers to charge customers' bills without their authorization.</p><p>The CFPB hopes to go further. In its rule banning mandatory arbitration clause earlier this month, it asserted that mobile carriers are under its jurisdiction because by processing third-party bills, they engage in a form of lending or servicing.</p><p>Consumer groups have also accused cellphone carriers of deceiving their customers through their new mobile financing programs. In December 2015, a group called Change to Win asked the CFPB to pursue T-Mobile over its equipment installment plan, accusing the company of deceptive advertising and abusive debt collection practices.</p><p>\"T-Mobile's \"~no contract' marketing is misleading because a customer's cancellation of his wireless service before two years makes the amount remaining on the installment plan immediately due,\" the group said, \"a fee that is often larger than the penalties associated with early termination of a traditional two-year service contract.\"</p><p>New York's attorney general, who had also fined T-Mobile over its third-party bill-cramming practice, began investigating the company's \"no contract\" claim that same month.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the market forces pushing cellphone companies towards fintech appear irresistible. Around the world, they are already emerging as industry leaders.</p><p>In Kenya, nearly half of the country's GDP is now processed through the payment app M-PESA, which was launched by the cellphone company Safaricom roughly 10 years ago.</p><p>Cellphone companies and financial services have merged in developed countries as well. In 2008, Japan's largest bank partnered with one of the country's leading cellphone carrier to launch anonline-only bank.</p><p>\"Banks should expect a lot of competition from all five cellphone companies, from big tech companies, from startups, from cable companies,\" Barefoot said. They \"should put tremendous priority on their mobile strategy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000015d-66a8-d5f8-ad5d-e7ff11370000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3B-9JG1-JCRW-5419-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SourceMedia, Inc.

The future of banking will be so different that many banks won't survive unless they clear out most or all of their executive suite, says a new report from Forrester .   The most important factor in future banking success is not customer experience, branch strategy or cloud utilization \u2014 it is the bank\u2019s self awareness, the new report concludes.    \u201cThe biggest thing holding banks back plays out in their culture,\u201d said Alyson Clarke, principal analyst at Forrester.         \u201cThe problem with banks is they get in their own way because they want to be best at everything, they want to own everything. They have a reluctance to go to cloud, reluctance to partner and be part of a larger ecosystem, so they build all their own technology and the technology goes out of date.\u201d     Banks need to take a really hard look at their organization and see where they do well and where they do not and then invest, divest or partner with a fintech or even another banks. And they need to move fast.    \u201cIf you wait too long you will fail. \u201cSome firms and some individuals, get that it can be very hard to move these big ships, so they may need a sweep of the executive suite. I hear all the time\u2026how slow are these firms to change, cultures get in the way of decisions\u2026 \u201cI hear \u2018We are still making a lot of money, we\u2019re fine\u2019\u201d.    But she says the tipping point is happening now, and points to Google which recently announced partnerships with eight banks and credit unions: Citi, Stanford Federal Credit Union, BBVA, Bank Mobile, BMO Harris, Coastal Community Bank, First Independence Bank and SEFCU.     \u201cGoogle will build account opening like a mobile banking environment. As a customer I go in and pick the products, checking or savings, through an amplified Google Pay platform. On the back end, the bank is owning the product, moving money, but customer interaction is through the front end that Google is building. So whilst it looks like co-branding, will customers see the (bank) brand and care, or will they go to the marketplace and see who has the best interest rate and go with it?\u201d    That could leave the banks competing on price, which most companies want to avoid, except for challengers which have the latest, most comprehensive and least expensive technology. Clarke thinks customers will feel they are getting value from Google, in the form of financial management budgeting and rewards programs with incentives to use Google Pay. The Big Tech companies like Google are better than banks at collecting and analyzing data, she added.    \u201cWe know Amazon and Google are masters of this, their businesses are built on data.\u201d They also are playing a different game than the banks.    \u201cThe focus on data in banking is let\u2019s find out what we can about our customers and flog them another product. But banking is not like Amazon where you buy a product often. We buy financial products every three to five years. So when banks focus data energy on selling products, they are probably just annoying customers. They have have overestimated the importance of their bank\u2019s brand in the consumer\u2019s life.\u201d    The big tech companies aren\u2019t all the same, except perhaps in wanting to get into banking services without becoming a regulated bank. Clarke said she was an outlier in her evaluation of the Apple card, saying other analysts were looking at it wrong.    \u201cFor Apple, it\u2019s a long-term play. You can\u2019t measure success on the same field as a credit card. Apple doesn\u2019t need revenue in the same way; they need an attraction to the brand. They want people buying more devices using Apple Pay, and they can turn up the dial on incentives and rewards when they want to.\u201d    Apple doesn\u2019t collect any user data, that concern for user privacy is part of its brand. Google, however, lives for the data to make money on advertising. Google is in an ecosystem of banks and merchants whom it is trying to keep happy, She sees increasing usage of Google Pay which is behind some other digital payment platforms. Google has access to the data they can sell back to merchants and assist with merchant reward programs.    \u201cThese offerings are enablers to other things.\u201d    Their priorities are different from banks\u2019 because their business models are different. For a bank that does get it, she points to Goldman Sachs and Apple in particular, which she describes as a partnership and a collaboration.    \u201cNo bank will do this alone,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is really, really critical that banks start to think about the future and the way they do business is not just them alone. Their partners could be fintechs, other organizations, tech vendors, they could even be other banks. The point is that it can\u2019t be done alone, and that\u2019s a really interesting and tough shift for many banks. Banks talk about partnerships, but it really is just a vendor relationship.\u201d    This offers both challenges and opportunities for community banks.    \u201cSome will succeed by creating niches, and they may understand their communities better than anyone else. However, they may also see they are not the best at building out the product, but so many don\u2019t trust anyone to be a partner.\u201d    You can see why she thinks executive suites may need comprehensive change.    \u201cBanks have to be nimble and adaptive, or they will keep having the same problems. The loop between technology and humans makes it hard for firms to keep up. You have to invest ahead of the change. You can\u2019t wait for it and follow it in the market. Banks face massive challenges in infrastructure, resources, interactions and talent pools,\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42913298779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NS-7VW1-JCSC-J0K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Advertising &amp;

Today, Massachusetts residents simply expect the same convenience and accessibility managing their money as they do in any other aspect of their lives. We have seen the hospitality, entertainment and transportation sectors \u2014 among others \u2014 completely disrupted. Big-box retailers have been forced to adapt or go out of business.</p><p>What about banking? Banks can survive and even thrive in the digital transformation, but only if they make the right moves.</p><p>In Greater Boston, the development of Kendall Square and the Seaport District highlight the region\u2019s status as a unique incubator for talent, underscored by the prominence of so many world-class academic institutions.</p><p>As one of the leading banks in Boston, and with our own focus on driving innovation, we welcome opportunities to foster the right kind of partnerships and entrepreneurship that are distinguishing Greater Boston. This summer, the bank held the first-ever Citizens Challenge Hackathon, which brought together 60 developers to generate data-driven solutions to overcome banks\u2019 daily operational challenges. A $10,000 grand prize was awarded for best overall app, and additional prizes were awarded for best commercial app, and best consumer app. Citizens is also a founding partner with the nonprofit MassChallenge on a recently launched accelerator program for financial technology startups.</p><p>A growing number of financial technology companies, or fintechs, have recognized how digital technology and finance could work together to create products to address the evolving needs of customers. However, they lack scale and want no part of the regulation that governs more traditional financial institutions. Many banks have viewed fintechs as disruptors, but smart banks see the value their innovation can bring to customers and are moving decisively to integrate cutting-edge outside technology into their offerings.</p><p>Whether by partnering with fintechs or developing their own solutions, most banks are moving quickly to invest in digital capabilities that provide similar kinds of frictionless customer experiences that resonate with customers in an increasingly digital marketplace.</p><p>In the consumer banking space, there are several high-profile examples: Goldman Sachs\u2019 \u201cMarcus\u201d digitally</p><p>offers no-fee personal loans and high-yield savings accounts, and Bank of America\u2019s \u201cErica\u201d is an A.I.-powered virtual assistant that enables banking via voice command, text or through gestures. And in commercial banking, there are many new platforms for trading, cash-management and payments.</p><p>Citizens has made its own moves along these lines as well. We were the first large regional bank to offer a fully integrated digital banking and wealth advisory offering. We see this service, called SpeciFi, as a great platform that makes investing more accessible to a larger set of customers.</p><p>We also recently launched a digital small-business lending platform, in collaboration with Fundation, that enables small businesses to quickly and easily apply for loans and lines of credit online.</p><p>Fintech partnerships should be grounded on an appreciation of change, and how to facilitate the right developments. But it\u2019s crucial for business leaders to make sure a partnership is solving a problem for the customer and not just done for its own sake.</p><p>It is also important that these partnerships with fintechs are not simply marriages of convenience, but reflect a genuine cultural shift for banks. A comprehensive approach on innovation will not only create a fast, seamless digital experience for customers, but a more efficient and creative company culture.</p><p>We have found that keeping pace with technological change requires an \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d approach. Smart thinking and great technologies, whether from inside an organization or from a third-party, will always represent an opportunity for growth and delivering greater value to customers.</p><p>But even in our digital-first world, nothing replaces trust. And while the digital revolution in banking is under way, there are surely many major changes just on the horizon. By staying on top of the competition and constantly evaluating external solutions and opportunities, forward-looking banks can find the right model for modern consumers looking to manage their money better.</p><p>Moving forward, it\u2019s apparent that while technology has certainly changed, customer expectations of banking haven\u2019t.

Today, Massachusetts residents simply expect the same convenience and accessibility managing their money as they do in any other aspect of their lives. We have seen the hospitality, entertainment and transportation sectors \u2014 among others \u2014 completely disrupted. Big-box retailers have been forced to adapt or go out of business.</p><p>What about banking? Banks can survive and even thrive in the digital transformation, but only if they make the right moves.</p><p>In Greater Boston, the development of Kendall Square and the Seaport District highlight the region\u2019s status as a unique incubator for talent, underscored by the prominence of so many world-class academic institutions.</p><p>As one of the leading banks in Boston, and with our own focus on driving innovation, we welcome opportunities to foster the right kind of partnerships and entrepreneurship that are distinguishing Greater Boston. This summer, the bank held the first-ever Citizens Challenge Hackathon, which brought together 60 developers to generate data-driven solutions to overcome banks\u2019 daily operational challenges. A $10,000 grand prize was awarded for best overall app, and additional prizes were awarded for best commercial app, and best consumer app. Citizens is also a founding partner with the nonprofit MassChallenge on a recently launched accelerator program for financial technology startups.</p><p>A growing number of financial technology companies, or fintechs, have recognized how digital technology and finance could work together to create products to address the evolving needs of customers. However, they lack scale and want no part of the regulation that governs more traditional financial institutions. Many banks have viewed fintechs as disruptors, but smart banks see the value their innovation can bring to customers and are moving decisively to integrate cutting-edge outside technology into their offerings.</p><p>Whether by partnering with fintechs or developing their own solutions, most banks are moving quickly to invest in digital capabilities that provide similar kinds of frictionless customer experiences that resonate with customers in an increasingly digital marketplace.</p><p>In the consumer banking space, there are several high-profile examples: Goldman Sachs\u2019 \u201cMarcus\u201d digitally</p><p>offers no-fee personal loans and high-yield savings accounts, and Bank of America\u2019s \u201cErica\u201d is an A.I.-powered virtual assistant that enables banking via voice command, text or through gestures. And in commercial banking, there are many new platforms for trading, cash-management and payments.</p><p>Citizens has made its own moves along these lines as well. We were the first large regional bank to offer a fully integrated digital banking and wealth advisory offering. We see this service, called SpeciFi, as a great platform that makes investing more accessible to a larger set of customers.</p><p>We also recently launched a digital small-business lending platform, in collaboration with Fundation, that enables small businesses to quickly and easily apply for loans and lines of credit online.</p><p>Fintech partnerships should be grounded on an appreciation of change, and how to facilitate the right developments. But it\u2019s crucial for business leaders to make sure a partnership is solving a problem for the customer and not just done for its own sake.</p><p>It is also important that these partnerships with fintechs are not simply marriages of convenience, but reflect a genuine cultural shift for banks. A comprehensive approach on innovation will not only create a fast, seamless digital experience for customers, but a more efficient and creative company culture.</p><p>We have found that keeping pace with technological change requires an \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d approach. Smart thinking and great technologies, whether from inside an organization or from a third-party, will always represent an opportunity for growth and delivering greater value to customers.</p><p>But even in our digital-first world, nothing replaces trust. And while the digital revolution in banking is under way, there are surely many major changes just on the horizon. By staying on top of the competition and constantly evaluating external solutions and opportunities, forward-looking banks can find the right model for modern consumers looking to manage their money better.</p><p>Moving forward, it\u2019s apparent that while technology has certainly changed, customer expectations of banking haven\u2019t. Fundamentally, customers want a trusted partner. Smart banks have been able to retain what has been best about banking while offering the kind of digital experiences that big tech companies have been providing.</p><p>Today, these banks are adapting to the needs of customers in our digital-first economy by developing solutions that deliver a superb customer experience. The pace of technological change is accelerating, but as customers in the Commonwealth are using new channels to access their finances, smart banks are rising to the challenge and providing customers with the best tools to help them reach their potential.</p><p>Jerry Sargent is president of Citizens BankMassachusetts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPRREP-MERLIN_83711166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPRREP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V37-F8F1-JCTS-G070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Republican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)</publicationName><edition>ALL S EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 31, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For its billion or so iPhone users, this promises to be \u2014 as the company put it \u2014 a new kind of credit card, built on simplicity, transparency and privacy and designed to help customers lead a healthier financial life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike other cards, Apple Card is primarily a digital and mobile offering complemented by a sleekly designed titanium metal card. The card number is fully digital, stored securely within the phone. Payments can be carried out primarily using the Apple Pay contactless payment option, authorised using biometrics and a one-time security code that changes for each transaction.</p><p>The card can be signed up for in minutes, there are no fees whatsoever \u2014 a first for any credit card \u2014 and interest rates are planned to be among the lowest in the industry. Customers can view their spends grouped by categories for easy understanding and budgeting, supported by geo-spatial data on purchase locations, and receive moderate rewards paid out daily as cash in the wallet.</p><p>Cool? It most certainly is, as with all products from the company that wants to put a dent in the universe.</p><p>Revolutionary? The jury is divided.</p><p>While the new card promises a better user experience and enhanced security, the fundamental and decades-old proposition of a credit card remains unaltered. Interest rates can vary significantly, up to double, based on customer credit worthiness, and cash back amounts are lower than what is offered by some the leading brands in the US.</p><p>And there are some nagging questions as to whether the easier payment options and immediate rewards will encourage impulsive spending and pile up consumer debt over time.</p><p>The advent of big tech</p><p>What the launch also signified is the slow but steady march of big tech firms towards banking. Facebook took initial steps in 2015 with the launch of a payments feature for US customers that allowed peer-to-peer transfers with no fees, and is now trialling WhatsApp Pay in emerging markets like India. The e-commerce giant Amazon launched its first financial product about a decade back and now offers insurance, co-branded credit cards and small business loans.</p><p>Google is scaling up its Google Pay wallet across markets and recently obtained an e-money license in Europe. The Chinese giants like Alibaba and Tencent are already significant players in most areas of banking in the country, including payments, loans and wealth management and are seeking to expand globally.</p><p>Big tech work from a strong customer-centric ethos, have a high level of customer trust (maybe not so high for Facebook!) and of course access to state-of-the-art technology, all of which makes for a strong combination. Open banking regulations in markets like UK and Europe that enable customers to allow businesses other than banks to access their financial data is levelling the financial services playing field for bank and non-bank players.</p><p>However, concerns are emerging about how rapid disruption by big tech can foster unhealthy competition resulting in, over time, lowered credit and risk standards. Governance frameworks in most countries are still evolving and central banks currently oversee only banks and not all banking in their jurisdictions. Unsupervised access to financial and other data can be unhealthy to customers, markets and societies.</p><p>Finally, potential domination by a handful of large global corporations can crowd out healthy competition and be in contravention of antitrust laws that exist in many countries.</p><p>Banking 3.0</p><p>While fintechs brought in innovation and agility to disrupt specific banking services, their lack of scale and customer trust engendered collaboration more than competition with banks. Big techs bring in, apart from innovation, access to large loyal customer bases, big data and deep pockets that provide them with significant additional advantages.</p><p>So how are financial services incumbents responding? Most banks have been digitising their operations rapidly, carrying out transformation of their technology platforms and collaborating with fintech start-ups to enhance products, processes and services. Banks are also building strong design competencies and teams \u2014 in the last one year, Emirates NBD has hired as many as 16 design professionals with backgrounds that range from art and visual design to ethnography and information architecture.</p><p>Progressive banks are building data capabilities to enhance user journeys and provide personalised customer offerings. They are also putting in place open banking interfaces to integrate seamlessly with non-bank partners, and creating eco-systems of their own to provide customers with frictionless experiences.</p><p>Last but not least, banks, financial industry players and big techs are also looking to come together where needed \u2014 as the partnership between Apple, MasterCard and Goldman Sachs to launch the Apple Card demonstrates \u2014 to introduce enhanced banking solutions. The next generation of banking is coming and the winner \u2014 undoubtedly \u2014 will be the customer.</p><p>Suvo Sarkar is Senior Executive Vice-President and Group Head \u2014 Retail Banking &amp; Wealth Management at Emirates NBD.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/5/155584807786.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/5/155584807786.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-142879245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXY-9071-JDJN-64MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

The net interest margin for the first quarter this year also came to a record-low of 1.46 percent.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBank loans have expanded since March as companies sought to secure liquidity amid market uncertainties, but demand is expected to shrink in the second half, unless the economy has a dramatic rebound,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the report said citing the profitability challenges of banks.Also, noting the imminent market changes such as the kick-off of the MyData business, expansion of the open banking service, and the rise of big tech players, the think tank warned banks to exert all efforts for digital transformation.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMega-sized platform operators such as Naver and Kakao are progressing at a face speed in the financial market, on the back of their simplified payment and remittance systems,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it said.Big players on the moveMajor banking groups here have been launching special committees and rolling out detailed plans tied to their digitalization businesses in recent weeks. </p><p>Shinhan Financial Group said it has decided to officially pursue its digitalization project Digilog in line with the government\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDigital New Deal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and to become a leader in adopting digital finance among its peers. The group held a management meeting on Wednesday to review four key businesses for the digitalization project. It has also launched a Digilog Committee -- chaired by the group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Chairman Cho Yong-byoung and consisting of top executives of its seven subsidiaries -- to focus on its digital projects including its data and startup nurturing businesses. The committee plans to focus on materializing 35 specific plans under the project. To add momentum to its digitalization, four more subsidiaries were tasked with goals of coming up with new business models in different areas of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and health care. In March, the group ordered six of its subsidiaries -- including its flagship Shinhan Bank, Shinhan Card and its insurance units -- to map out new business models in technologies they were assigned. The four new subsidiaries that joined the task included Shinhan Capital and Jeju Bank. The group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds research and development center, Shinhan Digital Innovation Institute, will be expanded and a digital education system will be established to hire and foster workforce centered on digital transformation, it said. Shinhan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds rival Woori Financial Group -- which launched a new vision for digitalization earlier in the year \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddigital for better life\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and established a digital innovation committee in April -- has selected 15 tech startups for partnerships in technology and services, it said on June 2. Startups that provide online real estate data, wireless payment solutions and digital asset management platform were among those selected for the program dubbed Digital Innovation Lab.Woori Financial Group Chairman Sohn Tae-seung recently labeled the current timeframe as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe golden time for digital innovation as the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bduntact\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (non-face-to-face contact) trend has evolved into the new normal due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Hana Financial Group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds flagship banking unit has also partnered with 14 firms as part of its startup partnership and fostering program, established in 2015. While the startup program itself has existed for several years, this year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds selection process was centered on finding firms that could provide untact technology in its partnership. KB Kookmin has been expanding its digital finance services based on its partnership with Amazon Web Services -- Amazon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cloud computing subsidiary -- and received approval from the state-run Financial Security Institute regarding the safety of its services. The FSI is an independent agency tasked with bolstering information management and protection. MyData test pilotsKorea\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds financial groups are adding significant momentum to the growth of personal credit information management services here dubbed MyData, a new data-driven industry fostered by the government.MyData refers to a business model that offers integrated management of personal credit information such as banking transactions or credit card records and make personalized product recommendations to customers. JB Financial Group said Monday it has been selected to lead a consortium of financial companies to take part in the government\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds MyData project. It is a state-led pilot test of MyData services in various industry sectors, aimed to strengthen individuals\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd authority to control and handle their own information. In March, the Ministry of Science and ICT and related ministries began to recruit local companies hoping to participate in the pilot program. A total of 31 consortiums applied for the program and the ministry selected eight consortiums out of them, respectively specialized in six different fields - health care, finance, public transportation, welfare, small enterprises and traffic, officials said. A consortium led by JB Financial Group -- which consists of the group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds affiliates including Jeonbuk and Kwangju banks as well as JB Woori Capital alongside SK Group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds key affiliates including SK Telecom, SK Networks and SK Energy as well as Fintech, an online-based lending solutions provider -- was chosen as the MyData operator in the finance sector.Through the pilot project, JB Financial plans to develop personalized financial products and services by making use of vast amounts of mobility data of customers, including records of visits to gas stations, vehicle inspection or recent driving routes, the group said. Earlier, a consortium of NH NongHyup\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds key finance units and local data firm SNP Lab was selected to develop an open platform for personal asset management.Meanwhile, in 2018, responding to the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfourth industrial revolution\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd driven by digital technology, the Korean government had announced plans to foster the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds data industry by 2022 and the on-going MyData project was one of them. Taking effect in August, a revised credit information act that eases regulations on the use of personal information for businesses will provide a legal framework for the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds MyData services in Korea.

The net interest margin for the first quarter this year also came to a record-low of 1.46 percent.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBank loans have expanded since March as companies sought to secure liquidity amid market uncertainties, but demand is expected to shrink in the second half, unless the economy has a dramatic rebound,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the report said citing the profitability challenges of banks.Also, noting the imminent market changes such as the kick-off of the MyData business, expansion of the open banking service, and the rise of big tech players, the think tank warned banks to exert all efforts for digital transformation.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMega-sized platform operators such as Naver and Kakao are progressing at a face speed in the financial market, on the back of their simplified payment and remittance systems,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it said.Big players on the moveMajor banking groups here have been launching special committees and rolling out detailed plans tied to their digitalization businesses in recent weeks. </p><p>Shinhan Financial Group said it has decided to officially pursue its digitalization project Digilog in line with the government\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDigital New Deal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and to become a leader in adopting digital finance among its peers. The group held a management meeting on Wednesday to review four key businesses for the digitalization project. It has also launched a Digilog Committee -- chaired by the group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Chairman Cho Yong-byoung and consisting of top executives of its seven subsidiaries -- to focus on its digital projects including its data and startup nurturing businesses. The committee plans to focus on materializing 35 specific plans under the project. To add momentum to its digitalization, four more subsidiaries were tasked with goals of coming up with new business models in different areas of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and health care. In March, the group ordered six of its subsidiaries -- including its flagship Shinhan Bank, Shinhan Card and its insurance units -- to map out new business models in technologies they were assigned. The four new subsidiaries that joined the task included Shinhan Capital and Jeju Bank. The group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds research and development center, Shinhan Digital Innovation Institute, will be expanded and a digital education system will be established to hire and foster workforce centered on digital transformation, it said. Shinhan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds rival Woori Financial Group -- which launched a new vision for digitalization earlier in the year \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddigital for better life\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and established a digital innovation committee in April -- has selected 15 tech startups for partnerships in technology and services, it said on June 2. Startups that provide online real estate data, wireless payment solutions and digital asset management platform were among those selected for the program dubbed Digital Innovation Lab.Woori Financial Group Chairman Sohn Tae-seung recently labeled the current timeframe as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe golden time for digital innovation as the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bduntact\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (non-face-to-face contact) trend has evolved into the new normal due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Hana Financial Group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds flagship banking unit has also partnered with 14 firms as part of its startup partnership and fostering program, established in 2015. While the startup program itself has existed for several years, this year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds selection process was centered on finding firms that could provide untact technology in its partnership. KB Kookmin has been expanding its digital finance services based on its partnership with Amazon Web Services -- Amazon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cloud computing subsidiary -- and received approval from the state-run Financial Security Institute regarding the safety of its services. The FSI is an independent agency tasked with bolstering information management and protection. MyData test pilotsKorea\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds financial groups are adding significant momentum to the growth of personal credit information management services here dubbed MyData, a new data-driven industry fostered by the government.MyData refers to a business model that offers integrated management of personal credit information such as banking transactions or credit card records and make personalized product recommendations to customers. JB Financial Group said Monday it has been selected to lead a consortium of financial companies to take part in the government\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds MyData project. It is a state-led pilot test of MyData services in various industry sectors, aimed to strengthen individuals\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd authority to control and handle their own information. In March, the Ministry of Science and ICT and related ministries began to recruit local companies hoping to participate in the pilot program. A total of 31 consortiums applied for the program and the ministry selected eight consortiums out of them, respectively specialized in six different fields - health care, finance, public transportation, welfare, small enterprises and traffic, officials said. A consortium led by JB Financial Group -- which consists of the group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds affiliates including Jeonbuk and Kwangju banks as well as JB Woori Capital alongside SK Group\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds key affiliates including SK Telecom, SK Networks and SK Energy as well as Fintech, an online-based lending solutions provider -- was chosen as the MyData operator in the finance sector.Through the pilot project, JB Financial plans to develop personalized financial products and services by making use of vast amounts of mobility data of customers, including records of visits to gas stations, vehicle inspection or recent driving routes, the group said. Earlier, a consortium of NH NongHyup\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds key finance units and local data firm SNP Lab was selected to develop an open platform for personal asset management.Meanwhile, in 2018, responding to the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfourth industrial revolution\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd driven by digital technology, the Korean government had announced plans to foster the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds data industry by 2022 and the on-going MyData project was one of them. Taking effect in August, a revised credit information act that eases regulations on the use of personal information for businesses will provide a legal framework for the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds MyData services in Korea.

Now, banks face what one financial regulator calls the \"real game-changer\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jesper Berg, the head of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, says the next big threat for banks is the rapid spread of big tech into financial services. The competitive tool is personal data and the playing field is far from even, he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The banks are constrained in what they can do with data, even using data across business lines, not to mention sharing it,\" Berg said in Copenhagen.</p><p>The concern is that banks need to comply with strict regulatory requirements to protect client data. But their industry is being infiltrated by competitors that aren't necessarily subject to the same rules. Berg suggests that political intervention might be the solution, that is, if banks are to have a fighting chance.</p><p>\"The biggest issue that needs to be decided at a high level of politics is, do we somehow make rules in relation to sharing and use of data similar, or do we keep a difference?</p><p>\"We need to think about whether, and when, we set rules that are different for different types of companies, where the activity is basically the same,\" said Berg.</p><p>Berg oversees a financial industry that has dealt with negative interest rates longer than any other, after Denmark's central bank first went below zero in 2012. That's weakened the finance sector, potentially putting it on the back foot as it tries to strengthen its defences against new competitors. Lars Rohde, the governor of the Danish central bank, has warned that banks will need to rethink their entire business model to adapt to the new world.</p><p>Because of the vast pools of information they collect, tech giants like Google, Amazon and Alibaba already enjoy a competitive advantage over banks, Berg says.</p><p>According to a February report by the global Financial Stability Board, the proprietary consumer data that big tech extracts from social media, combined with the industry's access to cheap funding, mean it \"could achieve scale very quickly in financial services\".</p><p>Part of the ascent of tech companies within financial services has to do with PSD2, a European directive designed to open up the payments industry to competition. In practical terms, it means banks need to pass on their data for free to non-banks, provided customers agree.</p><p>\"You could say that we've gone to the extreme with PSD2,\" Berg said. \"Not only can banks not use the data fully internally, but they cannot sell it. They have to give it away.\"</p><p>The FSB's February report makes the point that reducing entry barriers for big tech might ultimately hurt competition in financial services.</p><p>As an example, the FSB highlights China, where just two big tech firms account for more than 90percent of the mobile payments market.</p><p>\"Big data lives off selling information about you and me, so that other companies can target us more specifically,\" Berg said.</p><p>\"The potential real game-changer is big data, depending on what they choose to do.\"</p><p>That's because \"they know more about us than anyone else\".</p><p>Tech companies that offer loans or take deposits will need to apply for licences and abide by the same rules as banks, Berg said.</p><p>However, the requirements are far murkier for those that decide to operate as a platform for other financial service providers, and that puts banks at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>\"The link to customers would essentially be with big tech,\" Berg said.</p><p>\"And everyone knows that whoever has the link to the customers\" ends up being able to \"cream the profit,\" he said. | Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRETOR-115395754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRETOR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPB-GWF1-F091-R139-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pretoria News (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 09, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The House commit...</p><p>A U.S. House committee this week began reviewing the idea of allowing the likes of Amazon or Facebook to receive charters to operate as banks \u2014 an idea that\u2019s already gotten plenty of pushback from traditional financial institutions (FIs).   The House committee held a hearing on the idea after Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks in July proposed a new special purpose national banking charter for payments companies.   Overseen by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the charter would allow firms like Facebook, Google or Amazon to bypass the process by which they need to collect money transmitter licenses state by state. It would instead offer payment companies a national servicing platform to replace the regime of state regulations such firms would be subject to under existing laws.   However, the banking industry doesn\u2019t like that one bit.   \u201cWe oppose the OCC\u2019s effort to grant commercial companies like Amazon or Facebook a national payments charter to access to the Federal Reserve payments system and safety net, [the] most critical part of our country\u2019s financial infrastructure \u2026 without protecting the financial system and consumers from the concomitant increase in systemic risk,\u201d industry leaders wrote in a recent letter to key lawmakers.   Co-signed by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and The Clearing House, the letter argues that banks and non-bank technology firms are both already embracing innovation in customer service offerings. The groups argue that such efforts are secured under the current regulatory regime, and that allowing innovation at the expense of the financial system\u2019s stability isn\u2019t beneficial.   \u201cCommercial companies accessing a payments charter would avoid oversight and regulations that protect the financial system and consumers,\u201d the bank industry leaders wrote.   This isn\u2019t the OCC\u2019s first attempt to create a special banking charter that would benefit tech firms. The agency first proposed a special banking charter for FinTechs in 2014 that would limit pushback  from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the states and the courts.   But last fall, a federal appeals court questioned the OCC\u2019s authority to issue such a charter. And as the banking industry\u2019s letter shows, FIs are still displeased with the idea as well.   Specific Concerns     Among the issues the industry has raised are concerns that special purpose payment banks won\u2019t be subject to the federal Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) and other relevant statutes.   The industry claims that means payments banks wouldn\u2019t be subject to the same capital liquidity requirements that regular banks are. Nor would they be required to develop plans for recovery or restitution of funds in the event of a catastrophic situation, FIs claim.   Moreover, the industry\u2019s letter to House members noted that there\u2019s no framework in place to make sure that these \u201cnarrowly chartered\u201d banks would be subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the Community Reinvestment Act. That last measure aims to ensure that banks lend money and provide banking services to underserved and minority consumers.   \u201cThe potential for asymmetries in regulation across companies with different banking charters could produce regulatory arbitrage and undermine safety and soundness and consumer protection,\u201d the bankers wrote. \u201cA lack of safety and soundness rules will expose the financial system to significant vulnerabilities.\u201d   The letter urges caution in putting these licenses out into the market, arguing in favor of a transparent process that brings various financial services stakeholders in. The industry also wants Congress to determine if a federal money transmitter license that would preempt today\u2019s patchwork of state licensing laws actually represents an improvement.   Some critics also argue that allowing Big Tech firms like Google or Facebook to access special service licenses and placing them under national charters would give the firms an easy out from state consumer protection laws. They argue that the OCC would oversee the new charter holders \u2014 but not as rigorously as state regulators would. Moreover, critics claim the new charters would erase the distinction between banking and commerce \u2014 a separation typically justified as minimizing risks to the banking system, preventing anti-competitive behavior and averting concentration of economic power.   Given the historically contentious nature of this proposal, we imagine the idea of special banking charters for payments companies will continue to face a bumpy ride. The banking industry insists it\u2019s not hostile in principle to opening up the playing field to FinTechs, and that traditional FIs are open to doing something new. But according to the industry\u2019s letter, bankers insist that something new also be something right for the system.   \u201cThe benefits of financial innovation are only realized when they are delivered responsibly, in a way that does right by customers,\u201d the bankers wrote. \u201cThis means getting regulation right is critical. We look forward to a continued discussion around these important issues and stand ready as policymakers look to help promote responsible innovation in banking.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS TV LIVE OCTOBER SERIES: B2B PAYMENTS 2021 \u2013 WHAT WILL YOU CHANGE?

The House commit...</p><p>A U.S. House committee this week began reviewing the idea of allowing the likes of Amazon or Facebook to receive charters to operate as banks \u2014 an idea that\u2019s already gotten plenty of pushback from traditional financial institutions (FIs).   The House committee held a hearing on the idea after Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks in July proposed a new special purpose national banking charter for payments companies.   Overseen by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the charter would allow firms like Facebook, Google or Amazon to bypass the process by which they need to collect money transmitter licenses state by state. It would instead offer payment companies a national servicing platform to replace the regime of state regulations such firms would be subject to under existing laws.   However, the banking industry doesn\u2019t like that one bit.   \u201cWe oppose the OCC\u2019s effort to grant commercial companies like Amazon or Facebook a national payments charter to access to the Federal Reserve payments system and safety net, [the] most critical part of our country\u2019s financial infrastructure \u2026 without protecting the financial system and consumers from the concomitant increase in systemic risk,\u201d industry leaders wrote in a recent letter to key lawmakers.   Co-signed by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and The Clearing House, the letter argues that banks and non-bank technology firms are both already embracing innovation in customer service offerings. The groups argue that such efforts are secured under the current regulatory regime, and that allowing innovation at the expense of the financial system\u2019s stability isn\u2019t beneficial.   \u201cCommercial companies accessing a payments charter would avoid oversight and regulations that protect the financial system and consumers,\u201d the bank industry leaders wrote.   This isn\u2019t the OCC\u2019s first attempt to create a special banking charter that would benefit tech firms. The agency first proposed a special banking charter for FinTechs in 2014 that would limit pushback  from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the states and the courts.   But last fall, a federal appeals court questioned the OCC\u2019s authority to issue such a charter. And as the banking industry\u2019s letter shows, FIs are still displeased with the idea as well.   Specific Concerns     Among the issues the industry has raised are concerns that special purpose payment banks won\u2019t be subject to the federal Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) and other relevant statutes.   The industry claims that means payments banks wouldn\u2019t be subject to the same capital liquidity requirements that regular banks are. Nor would they be required to develop plans for recovery or restitution of funds in the event of a catastrophic situation, FIs claim.   Moreover, the industry\u2019s letter to House members noted that there\u2019s no framework in place to make sure that these \u201cnarrowly chartered\u201d banks would be subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the Community Reinvestment Act. That last measure aims to ensure that banks lend money and provide banking services to underserved and minority consumers.   \u201cThe potential for asymmetries in regulation across companies with different banking charters could produce regulatory arbitrage and undermine safety and soundness and consumer protection,\u201d the bankers wrote. \u201cA lack of safety and soundness rules will expose the financial system to significant vulnerabilities.\u201d   The letter urges caution in putting these licenses out into the market, arguing in favor of a transparent process that brings various financial services stakeholders in. The industry also wants Congress to determine if a federal money transmitter license that would preempt today\u2019s patchwork of state licensing laws actually represents an improvement.   Some critics also argue that allowing Big Tech firms like Google or Facebook to access special service licenses and placing them under national charters would give the firms an easy out from state consumer protection laws. They argue that the OCC would oversee the new charter holders \u2014 but not as rigorously as state regulators would. Moreover, critics claim the new charters would erase the distinction between banking and commerce \u2014 a separation typically justified as minimizing risks to the banking system, preventing anti-competitive behavior and averting concentration of economic power.   Given the historically contentious nature of this proposal, we imagine the idea of special banking charters for payments companies will continue to face a bumpy ride. The banking industry insists it\u2019s not hostile in principle to opening up the playing field to FinTechs, and that traditional FIs are open to doing something new. But according to the industry\u2019s letter, bankers insist that something new also be something right for the system.   \u201cThe benefits of financial innovation are only realized when they are delivered responsibly, in a way that does right by customers,\u201d the bankers wrote. \u201cThis means getting regulation right is critical. We look forward to a continued discussion around these important issues and stand ready as policymakers look to help promote responsible innovation in banking.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS TV LIVE OCTOBER SERIES: B2B PAYMENTS 2021 \u2013 WHAT WILL YOU CHANGE?

The transaction was valued at $31.18 billion when it closed in 2019, making it the largest U.S. bank merger since 2004.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two of that deal's advisers   Vinnie Badinehal, managing director and head of the U.S. financial institutions group at RBC Capital Markets LLC, and Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP   spoke about the Truist MOE and other industry dynamics in a December 2019 interview for S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's \"The Big Deal\" podcast.</p><p>The advisers noted that the push for more scale has been a driver in U.S. bank M&amp;A, which is not going to change. The desire to get bigger is almost always a motivating factor for buyers to pursue targets, but the reasons that banks are looking to expand have changed.</p><p>Revenue drivers</p><p>Cohen said depositories are not just looking to take out cost when executing acquisitions. Banks are also looking for ways to boost revenue. \"Scale has moved out of the back office to the front office in terms of delivery in marketing of products and services,\" Cohen said.</p><p>Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLPSource: AP Photo Badinehal said banks are trying to serve customers more quickly, and improved technology is one way to do this. Adding greater technological capabilities is something deal advisers have cited as a reason behind many recent acquisitions.</p><p>\"As technology becomes more critical, scale has become even more important,\" Badinehal said.</p><p>Investing in technology was a rationale for the Truist deal, but to make a deal that large successful, the companies must have compatible boards, Cohen said.</p><p>\"It's not easy to find the match that those two institutions provided,\" he said.</p><p>However, not all banks need to find large merger partners or buyers. While the advisers believe that scale is important for banks, Cohen said a dramatic drop in the number of community banks would prove problematic for the local economies they serve. Those institutions not only lend to local businesses but also play an important role in community infrastructure.</p><p>\"Who serves on the city council, the local hospital board?\" Cohen said. \"Who helps raise the money for whatever is needed in the community?\"</p><p>Vinnie Badinehal, managingdirector and head of U.S. FIGwith RBC Capital Markets LLCSource: RBC Capital Markets The technology challenge</p><p>Cohen added that he hopes policymakers understand the importance of community banks and make efforts to preserve those institutions. He would also like to see regulators take a stance regarding technology companies moving into the financial services space.</p><p>He said the competition between technology companies and banks is healthy, but it is important that technology companies face the same regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>\"Competition should not be decided by laxity in regulation,\" he said.</p><p>Badinehal agreed, saying it could hurt the soundness of the financial system if technology companies do not face the same requirements as their more regulated peers. However, he added, innovation is a positive for the industry. He noted that banks investing in technology and the competition from financial technology companies have helped to improve the products and services banks provide to customers.</p><p>Still, lower valuations have created an obstacle to deal-making. Just about all industries have seen a sell-off stemming from fears of the economic backlash related to the new coronavirus. However, many bank stocks have been hit harder than the broader market.</p><p>Reduced purchasing power</p><p>Lower valuations can depress deal activity because buyers have weaker currency and sellers are less inclined to sell for reduced prices. The recent pricing environment can make MOEs more appealing because those deals come with low or no premiums.</p><p>But February saw just 10 bank M&amp;A deals announced, the lowest monthly total since August 2016. During the interview, Cohen said the early part of 2020 is pivotal for large deals because bigger transactions could slow as the U.S. presidential election nears.</p><p>On the episode, Badinehal and Cohen discussed: 4:05 The push for scale in bank deals7:14 Whether the industry will see another BB&amp;T/SunTrust-sized deal 9:28 The election and how it could impact bank M&amp;A 11:57 The depository merger-of-equal trend 13:40 The optimal size of public banks and the survive-ability of community banks 18:40 Big tech's impact on the banking landscape</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLXTR-57245161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLXTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDM-62G1-F19Y-C4VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Financial Extra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002Q6Y</classCode><className>SULLIVAN &amp;

Fintech-backed platforms have made waves as well, with the likes of Chime attracting 5 million users and a valuation of nearly $6 billion. Big tech has also entered the fray, with Apple marketing a credit card and Google announcing plans to unveil a checking account in 2020 through partnerships with Citigroup Inc. and Stanford FCU.</p><p>\"Street Talk\" is a podcast hosted by S&amp;P Global</p><p>Market Intelligence.</p><p>Listen on SoundCloud and iTunes.</p><p>David Sandler, co-head of investment banking and principal at Sandler O'Neill, spoke about the planned Google partnership at a Dec. 2 event hosted by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and questioned who actually owns the customer relationship if Google acquires the deposits and provides the technology to service them.</p><p>More recently, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Chairman, President and CEO William Demchak addressed the Google partnership at a Dec. 10 investor conference, noting that a bank makes a mistake the moment it puts its distribution strategy in the hands of someone else. \"You effectively sold yourself to the devil,\" Demchak said at the event.</p><p>Technology companies could continue to move into the banking business, which will likely further pressure net interest margins, Sandler said at the Dec. 2 event. He believes technology companies could very easily build products and services to acquire the customers without a balance sheet and then bid the loans and deposits out to banks that become more like hedge fund balance sheets.</p><p>\"When you look at the attack that's coming from a place that's exogenous, it's not so much new and improved technology, it's the financial model. It's a negative cost of capital that is balance sheet lite, can grow to the moon, and mistakes aren't penalized by two years in a regulatory jail,\" Sandler said in the episode. \"We've had a lot of Fed easing so far, and the high rates getting paid on BankRate right now are still quite high and haven't tracked fed funds reductions. That tells you how banks are competing for that marginal customer in a different way. And I think it's reflected in margin really.\"</p><p>Renee Brooks, COO at Columbia, S.C.-based South State Corp., which has worked to modernize its digital offerings in recent years, said at the Dec. 2 event that technology has changed the competitive landscape. She noted that years ago, when a CD customer came to a bank to withdraw funds, the institution had the opportunity to talk to them and convince them to stay. That is no longer the case with customers using digital channels, she said.</p><p>\"Today, you find you can get a higher interest rate from whoever, they move immediately,\" Brooks said in the episode. \"It's a very different dynamic.\"</p><p>Still, the executive said customers tend to change banks for better customer service, and her institution has updated its digital channels to meet customer needs. Those efforts have yielded positive results, with 10% of checking accounts now being opened through more cost-efficient digital channels. She further noted that digital channels are responsible for 80% of new checking accounts opened at the bank.</p><p>\"Without the channel, you could miss out,\" Brooks said. \"80% are brand-new customers coming to the bank. They wanted to open their account at 9 at night, and they couldn't find you online, then they're just going to go to the next bank.\"</p><p>Brooks and others at the Dec. 2 event said banks need to invest in technology for commercial customers as well. Steve Valadie, senior vice president of fintech strategy at First Horizon National Corp., said at the event that commercial customers not only expect effective technology but connectivity with their own software.</p><p>\"It's not a case of using your treasury management system to do some function and then their internal system to do some other function. They just want it to be seamless,\" Valadie said. A number of banks in sizable mergers, including First Horizon's planned merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corp., the tie-up of BB&amp;T/SunTrust and most recently, Independent Bank Group Inc./Texas Capital Bancshares Inc., have touted the importance of scale when announcing their transactions. Those institutions have noted that the larger size will allow for greater efficiencies and necessary investments in technology.</p><p>Sandler said those deals allow banks to cut significant costs and generate strong earnings accretion. There is less risk associated with the expected earnings growth from those deals, he said, than trying to drive results by rolling out new products, expanding into new markets or growing the balance sheet significantly, particularly at such a late stage in the credit cycle.</p><p>\"Those all have a return on investment that are not as well defined and as low risk,\" Sandler said. \"That is the most motivating transaction in financial services right now. Scale for cost savings.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLXTR-56081196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLXTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR7-0YD1-JDVW-N154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Financial Extra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009QZC</classCode><className>ALLY FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0001W44</classCode><className>CIT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC00035TS</classCode><className>STANFORD FEDERAL CREDIT UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001Y6R</classCode><className>PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Accenture analyzed more than 20,000 banking and payments institutions across seven markets to quantify the level of change and disruption in the global banking industry. The study found that the number of banking and payments institutions decreased by nearly 20 percent over a 12-year period \u2014 from 24,000 in 2005 to less than 19,300 in 2017. However, nearly one in six (17 percent) current institutions are what Accenture considers new entrants \u2014 i.e., companies entering the market after 2005. While few of these new players have raised alarm bells among traditional banks, the threat of reduced future revenue growth opportunities is real and growing.     Two new reports from Accenture quantify the level of disruption in the banking industry: \u201cBeyond North Star Gazing\u201d discusses how industry change is shaping the strategic priorities for banks, and \u201cStar Shifting: Rapid Evolution Required\u201d outlines what banks can do to take advantage of these changes to maintain customer relevance and ensure future revenue growth.    \u201cMost banks are struggling to find the right mix of investments in traditional and digital capabilities as they balance meeting the needs of digital customers with maintaining legacy systems that protect customer data,\u201d said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of its global Banking practice. </p><p>\u201cBanks can\u2019t simply digitally enable their business as usual and expect to be successful. So far, the conservative approach to digital investment has hindered banks\u2019 ability to build new sources of growth, which is crucial to escaping the tightening squeeze of competition from digital attackers and deteriorating returns.\u201d   Industry disruption Many incumbent banks continue to dismiss the threat of new entrants, claiming that (1) new entrants are not creating new innovations, but rather dressing up traditional banking products; (2) significant revenue is not moving to new entrants; and (3) new entrants are not generating profits. However, the reports analyzed where revenue is shifting to new entrants and identifies examples of true innovation happening around the world that can no longer be dismissed. Accenture predicts that the shift in revenue to new entrants will continue and will start to have a material impact on incumbent banks\u2019 profits.   U.S.: Nineteen percent of financial institutions in the U.S. are new entrants and have captured 3.5 percent of total banking and payments revenues. Over the past dozen years, the number of financial institutions in the U.S. has decreased by nearly one-quarter, largely due to the financial crisis and subsequent regulatory hurdles imposed to obtain a banking license. These factors have made the U.S. a difficult market for new entrants and a stable environment for incumbents. More than half of new current accounts opened in the U.S. have been captured by three large banks that are making material investments in digital, while regional banks focus on cost reduction and struggle to grow their balance sheets.    \u201cTen years after the financial crisis, the banking industry is experiencing a level of competitive intensity and disruption that\u2019s much greater than what\u2019s been seen before,\u201d said Julian Skan, a senior managing director at Accenture and global Banking lead, Accenture Strategy. \u201cWith challenger banks and platform players reducing traditional banks\u2019 competitiveness and the threat of a power shift looming, incumbent players can no longer rest on their laurels. Banks are mobilizing to take advantage of industry changes, leveraging digital technologies and ecosystem business models to cement their relevance with customers and regain revenue growth.\u201d   UK: With regulation increasing competition in the financial services industry and reducing the dominance of established banks, 63 percent of players in the UK are new entrants. This is eye-popping compared with other markets and the 17 percent global average. New entrants have captured 14 percent of total banking revenues, with the clear majority (12 percent) going to non-bank payments institutions. While they have only taken around 14 percent of revenues, the reports suggest that they are taking over one third of new revenue indicating a higher level of disruption in the future. The reports also suggest that incumbent banks will therefore likely start to see a significant impact on revenues as leading challenger banks are surpassing the 1 million customer threshold and 15 fintechs have been granted full banking licenses.   Canada: Investors have backed new entrants in Canada with the intention of disrupting the banking industry. While nearly half (47 percent) of banking and payments institutions are new entrants, they have captured less than 2 percent of total banking and payments revenue, making Canada one of the least disrupted major banking markets.   Europe: In Europe (including the UK), 20 percent of the banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7 percent of total banking revenue \u2014 and one-third (33 percent) of all new revenue since 2005.     \u201cAs the banking industry experiences radical change, driven by regulation, new entrants and demanding consumers, banks will need to reassess their assets, strengths and capabilities to determine if they are taking their business in the right direction,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThe future belongs to banks that can build new sources of growth, including finding opportunities beyond traditional financial services. They can\u2019t afford to blindly follow the path they originally set out at the beginning of their digital journey. However, as the report clearly shows, there is no single answer and each bank needs to truly understand the market it is operating in before charting a path forward\u201d     Methodology Using data from various sources, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and other local central banks, Accenture Research analyzed more than 20,000 institutions in the banking and payments market across seven markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States. Of the companies analyzed, 3,200 are considered \u201cnew players\u201d (having entered the market since 2005), which fall into three main categories: licensed banks; payments players (payment system providers, including e-money services, and payment system operators other than banks); and non-licensed players, including well-established \u201cfintech\u201d start-ups. Additional analysis of banking revenues was conducted for Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States, based on company data, where consistently available, and economic modeling.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN915299720181018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THG-M6F1-DXCW-D43F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1164\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 18, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The study found that the number of banking and payments institutions decreased by nearly 20 percent over a 12-year period - from 24,000 in 2005 to less than 19,300 in 2017. However, nearly one in six (17 percent) current institutions are what Accenture considers new entrants - i.e., companies entering the market after 2005. While few of these new players have raised alarm bells among traditional banks, the threat of reduced future revenue growth opportunities is real and growing.</p><p>Two new reports from Accenture quantify the level of disruption in the banking industry: \" <url normalizedValue=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fus-en%2Finsights%2Fbanking%2Fbusiness-models-beyond-north-star-gazing&amp;esheet=51884169&amp;newsitemid=20181017005055&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Beyond+North+Star+Gazing&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8dfb90d70eae3a3bfa9b0f57c3838881\">Beyond North Star Gazing</url> \" discusses how industry change is shaping the strategic priorities for banks, and \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fus-en%2Finsights%2Fbanking%2Frapid-evolution-required-growth-digital-acceleration&amp;esheet=51884169&amp;newsitemid=20181017005055&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Star+Shifting%3A+Rapid+Evolution+Required&amp;index=2&amp;md5=ff0ffc4657a64ecb74e63dc9ea49499a\">Star Shifting: Rapid Evolution Required</url> \" outlines what banks can do to take advantage of these changes to maintain customer relevance and ensure future revenue growth.</p><p>\"Most banks are struggling to find the right mix of investments in traditional and digital capabilities as they balance meeting the needs of digital customers with maintaining legacy systems that protect customer data,\" said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of its global Banking practice. \"Banks can't simply digitally enable their business as usual and expect to be successful. So far, the conservative approach to digital investment has hindered banks' ability to build new sources of growth, which is crucial to escaping the tightening squeeze of competition from digital attackers and deteriorating returns.\"</p><p>Industry disruption</p><p>Many incumbent banks continue to dismiss the threat of new entrants, claiming that (1) new entrants are not creating new innovations, but rather dressing up traditional banking products; (2) significant revenue is not moving to new entrants; and (3) new entrants are not generating profits. However, the reports analyzed where revenue is shifting to new entrants and identifies examples of true innovation happening around the world that can no longer be dismissed. Accenture predicts that the shift in revenue to new entrants will continue and will start to have a material impact on incumbent banks' profits.</p><p>U.S.: Nineteen percent of financial institutions in the U.S. are new entrants and have captured 3.5 percent of total banking and payments revenues. Over the past dozen years, the number of financial institutions in the U.S. has decreased by nearly one-quarter, largely due to the financial crisis and subsequent regulatory hurdles imposed to obtain a banking license. These factors have made the U.S. a difficult market for new entrants and a stable environment for incumbents. More than half of new current accounts opened in the U.S. have been captured by three large banks that are making material investments in digital, while regional banks focus on cost reduction and struggle to grow their balance sheets.</p><p>\"Ten years after the financial crisis, the banking industry is experiencing a level of competitive intensity and disruption that's much greater than what's been seen before,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fus-en%2Fcompany-julian-skan&amp;esheet=51884169&amp;newsitemid=20181017005055&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Julian+Skan&amp;index=3&amp;md5=010e6fdd7c57e42b4840386bfcd33930\">Julian Skan</url> , a senior managing director at Accenture and global Banking lead,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2FStrategy&amp;esheet=51884169&amp;newsitemid=20181017005055&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Accenture+Strategy&amp;index=4&amp;md5=63fa844aeae66ae618869a0e2284b6d3\">Accenture Strategy</url> . \"With challenger banks and platform players reducing traditional banks' competitiveness and the threat of a power shift looming, incumbent players can no longer rest on their laurels. Banks are mobilizing to take advantage of industry changes, leveraging digital technologies and ecosystem business models to cement their relevance with customers and regain revenue growth.\"</p><p>UK: With regulation increasing competition in the financial services industry and reducing the dominance of established banks, 63 percent of players in the UK are new entrants. This is eye-popping compared with other markets and the 17 percent global average. New entrants have captured 14 percent of total banking revenues, with the clear majority (12 percent) going to non-bank payments institutions. While they have only taken around 14 percent of revenues, the reports suggest that they are taking over one third of new revenue indicating a higher level of disruption in the future. The reports also suggest that incumbent banks will therefore likely start to see a significant impact on revenues as leading challenger banks are surpassing the 1 million customer threshold and 15 fintechs have been granted full banking licenses.</p><p>Canada: Investors have backed new entrants in Canada with the intention of disrupting the banking industry.

It's a matter of belief as to what is core,\" he told The Business Times.</p><p>The digital grab by fintechs has been particularly stark in China and India: China's unsecured consumer lending market has had digital players' share balloon from one per cent in 2013 to 25 per cent in 2016, while digital players involved in mutual fund sales snagged 12 per cent of the market within three years. In India, Paytm, an electronic payment and e-commerce company, now has 220 million users, up by ten times from 22 million in 2014.</p><p>\"Platform companies such as Alibaba, Amazon and Tencent are reshaping one industry after another, blurring sector boundaries as they seek to be all things to all people,\" the McKinsey report said.</p><p>As Chinese companies begin to step out of their domestic market, the current competition trends pose an existential question for banks. This is particularly as they remain threatened by high costs that weigh down their return on equity (ROE), nearly ten years after the financial crisis that led to banks having to hold a significant amount of capital as buffer against potential future shocks.</p><p>McKinsey further noted global banking numbers showing that the core businesses of financing and lending that pivot off the bank's balance sheet generated 53 per cent of industry revenues, but only 35 per cent of profits, with an ROE of 4.4 per cent.</p><p>The distribution business, on the other hand, produced the remaining 47 per cent of revenues but 65 per cent of profits, and more importantly, translated to an ROE of 20 per cent.</p><p>\"As platform companies extend their tentacles into banking, it is the rich returns of the distribution business they are targeting. And in many cases, they are better positioned for distribution than banks are.\"</p><p>For DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, it comes down to banks thinking like large technology firms, with DBS reporting late this year stronger returns from engaging digital customers.</p><p>\"You have a Hobson's choice. You have to deal with it,\" he told reporters in a media briefing in November on the bank's digital strategy. \"If I don't do anything, Big Tech will kill me anyway. This way, at least I have a shot at competing.\"</p><p>OCBC's chief executive Samuel Tsien said the bank is observing how the Chinese fintechs are rapidly taking over traditional incumbents, and very quickly moving beyond China, to be regional, and global.</p><p>\"South-east Asia is a fertile playing ground for them,\" he said in a speech at the Singapore Fintech Festival.</p><p>\"I see these Chinese tech giants as a positive force propelling us forward in the digital world. Observe and learn from them. Observe how when the Western countries were building applications with advanced technology, China was building platforms with advanced applications.\"</p><p>This comes as the Singapore regulators opened the way for banks here to put some money in certain digital consumer platforms.</p><p>In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore made it easier for banks to invest in digital platforms that match buyers and sellers, as well as those engaging in the online sale of consumer goods and services. Examples of such platforms include Carousell and Qoo10, with the investment in such related businesses capped at 10 per cent of the bank's capital funds.</p><p>McKinsey suggested that just as technology firms integrate their services into customers' needs, banks that have built digital skills and rapid reflexes could take the market, too.</p><p>\"Banks that successfully orchestrate a basic 'ecosystem' strategy, by building partnerships and monetising data, could raise their ROE to about 9 to 10 per cent. Banks that can go further and create their own platforms might capture a small share of some non-banking markets, which would elevate their ROE to about 14 per cent - far above the current industry average.\"</p><p>Banks here have made their moves. DBS launched an online marketplace for cars by working with sgCarMart and Carro - becoming in effect the largest direct seller-to-buyer car marketplace in Singapore.</p><p>OCBC also tied up with telco player StarHub to harness data insight. By using artificial intelligence and Internet of Things to analyse customers' demands, the aim is to \"seamlessly string life, work and play together\" alongside customers' banking needs, said Mr Tsien.</p><p>Analysts have pointed out that banks would have to make worthwhile investments on their digital infrastructure. DBS spends about S$1 billion annually on IT-related expenditure, of which S$400 million is spent on new IT initiatives supporting innovation and product rollout. It would also move more of its operations onto the cloud.</p><p>A UOB spokeswoman said that from 2014 to 2016, half of UOB's S$700 million IT budget was spent on new initiatives. Of these new initiatives, close to 60 per cent of the investments are in \"strategic projects\" focused mainly on mobile, payments, data and product-related technologies. The rest go to spending to meet regulation and security needs.</p><p>It has seen an increase in take-up of digital services. As at September 2017, 67 per cent of all transactions at UOB were through digital channels, up from 63 per cent in 2016.</p><p>Banks already see a pay-off from digital investments. OCBC put out numbers in September showing that digital consumer customers in 2016 held two times more products with the bank than non-digital clients. It was also two times more profitable to work with digital consumer customers in 2016 compared to 2012.</p><p>Likewise, DBS's digital customers offer twice as much income compared to customers who stick with brick-and-mortar banking. Digital customers make up nearly 40 per cent of all customers, and they in turn contribute 68 per cent of pre-allowance profit. To add, the ROE earned off digital customers from Singapore and Hong Kong stood at 27 per cent in the first half of 2017, compared to the ROE from non-digital customers of 19 per cent in that period.</p><p>As banks gear up for more competition ahead, what is shifting in their favour is regulatory posture. Mr Gupta noted that in the area of regulatory arbitrage, the pendulum is beginning to swing back to the banks' advantage. Chinese regulators have all started looking at new ways of putting regulations in place, he observed.</p><p>\"As these companies are trying to go outside of China, they are finding it not that easy, because there are more regulatory impediments in other markets and some cases, they are nationalist agendas. In India, they are very concerned about what sort of data will go to China,\" he added.</p><p>On that note, he is more optimistic than before about the bank cracking with a digital strategy the biggest market today: China. While he did not put out firm plans on how to tackle China, he told reporters that DBS's mobile-only strategy in Indonesia and India has given him ideas.</p><p>\"Our learnings from Indonesia and India suggest to me that notwithstanding what they have (in China), there is still opportunity for a bank to create niche positions, if we can think of the right segments to go for.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr Sengupta says banks might have to explore how they can go beyond traditional banking, one that plays to being a distributor of services, rather than just lending off their balance sheet while Mr Gupta (above) notes that in the area of regulatory arbitrage, the pendulum is beginning to swing back to the banks' advantage.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-183643</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R59-2SM1-DYX4-02GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 12, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000094</classCode><className>ANNUAL REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000718</classCode><className>FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SP3</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTIyNTc4QzVERTgwNDg1MkFERTdDREZFRDQ2QjkzNDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode><className>Funds Transfers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEFE</classCode><className>INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000570</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BILLING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

The reviews found examples of infrastructure that was, in industry parlance, at end-of-life or end-of-support, meaning less resilient, with a dated security model and no longer capable of supporting change.</p><p>Further, there were no plans in place to deal with the problem, and there was little evidence of issues having been escalated to senior executive and board levels.</p><p>That's worrying enough by itself. But, as Byres points out, open banking is also on its way, with the finance sector required to make data available to external parties, including customers and competitors, when the banks have difficulty accessing it themselves.</p><p>\"In reality, the complexity of systems and process environments and reliance on manual processes have made the mapping of data lineages, managing data quality and the aggregation of data difficult,\" the APRA chief said.</p><p>While larger banks were tackling the problem through the appointment of chief data officers and development of data management frameworks, a bank that was fit for the future would have built the necessary systems long ago and been using them to good effect.</p><p>As things currently stood, significant investment would be required to conform with the new open banking obligations.</p><p>Byres concludes that, to facilitate new technology, investment budgets need to be increased, not just reprioritised. They would also have to be maintained at a higher level to catch up on a growing backlog of investment priorities.</p><p>Word on the street Parties to the failed $16 billion-plus merger between Catholic Super Fund and Sydney rival Australian Catholic Superannuation Retirement Fund continue to keep a wary eye on each other.</p><p>The level of mutual trust, which was never high, pretty much evaporated when CSF proposed Danny Casey as an independent chairman in last year's merger discussions without revealing he was a CSF consultant.</p><p>Casey, recruited by George Pell in 2004 as the first layman to hold the position of business manager in the Archdiocese of Sydney, subsequently became CSF chairman last October.</p><p>Having previously worked at Lend Lease, Ernst &amp; Young and Middletons (now K&amp;L Gates), Casey was lured by Pell to the Vatican in 2014 to work on a transformation of the Holy See's finances.</p><p>Payment for the two-year term as leader of the project management office in Pell's Secretariat for the Economy was reportedly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15,000 ($22,000) a month.</p><p>According to the Irish Times, the secretariat authorised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90,000 of renovations to Casey's rented apartment.</p><p>Among his tasks as Pell's right-hand man was the transfer of APSA - the Vatican's financial powerhouse that oversees its properties and assets - into the secretariat. Not surprisingly, the initiative encountered fierce internal resistance, resulting in a ruling by Pope Francis that the secretariat would have a more limited, supervisory role in relation to APSA's main functions.</p><p>Casey said in 2016, after returning home, that one of the big challenges he faced in Rome was a culture where authority wasn't questioned.</p><p>Despite this, the reforms, which included a change in leadership at the Vatican bank, appointment of the first independent auditor-general and better budgeting and control of expenditure, were \"irreversible\", and there were no longer any \"pools of darkness\".</p><p>\"It doesn't mean there was skulduggery or financial malpractice, but in the absence of having some transparency of financial investments off the books how do you know?\" Casey said. \"The total amount off the books, when you take into account the entities, was about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 billion.\" Merger discussions between CSF and ACSRF lasted for the best part of 2017, as APRA intensified pressure on smaller funds to achieve scale. The financial services royal commission probed the transaction to highlight the impediments to successful deals.</p><p>In its submission after the hearings, ACSRF lashed out at CSF for its insistence on being the dominant merger partner, as well as proposing Casey as an independent chair of the enlarged entity but failing to disclose he had acted as a CSF consultant.</p><p>ACSRF said Casey could not have met CSF's own definition of independence.

With the new year just around the corner, it seems timely to indulge in this unintended optimism and ask what lies ahead for the banking industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A question mark hangs over the way in which business models in banking would shift to account for the ongoing digital disruption. McKinsey's 2017 banking report has dour predictions of return on equity (ROE) in the banking industry hitting 5.2 per cent by 2025, if banks sit on their hands.</p><p>Three paths</p><p>The consultancy pointed to three main paths ahead for banks to take. The first two are more traditional in nature: a bank can make more economical returns by scaling up; or it can become a specialist, focusing on fatter margins.</p><p>While straightforward in theory, the two models have their hurdles. The last financial crisis would give pause to banks that want to bulk up for strategic advantage. To be sure, much of the stress during the crisis came from heady trading of collateralised debt obligations built on subprime mortgages, and less from plain-vanilla lending.</p><p>But against the backdrop of \"too big to fail\" regulations, the sprawling ambitions of global domination have been scaled back as large financial institutions underwent massive spring cleaning, shedding assets and exiting markets.</p><p>The second option is the specialist track, but it doesn't come cheap. As McKinsey's Asia-Pacific banking practice leader Joydeep Sengupta put it, customers willing to pay a premium will also demand much better service. It's not enough to claim to be best of breed. Banks need to invest in people and systems to work in order to justify the premiums. This is an option for just a select few.</p><p>Which brings us to the third - and fresher - option: to have banks challenge platform companies in the distribution of services, which is particularly relevant for the consumer business. A platform business generally refers to one that sells products and services developed in-house or from other businesses, with such businesses typically earning a fee from the users, or the merchants. Top consumer tech companies, including Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, and Google, are examples of platform players.</p><p>Banks already distribute services for a fee, selling third-party products to private banking clients, or commercial banking services such as cash management. By McKinsey's calculations, the distribution business made up 47 per cent of global banking revenues and, even more impressive, 65 per cent of profits. The fee-generating business translated to an ROE of 20 per cent, compared to the ROE of 4.4 per cent from financing and lending activities.</p><p>But as banking services are increasingly being unbundled and products looking more commoditised, the question now is how banks can be better as distribution players by learning from platform firms.</p><p>With technology, barriers to entry are coming down - and banks must address pain points to offer differentiated service. Globally, Big Tech firms have paved the way by endearing themselves closely to consumers, becoming the preferred point of entry for customers to acquire various forms of services, including banking.</p><p>Banks can use cloud technology and application programming interfaces to plug into new distribution channels, selling credit cards to retail customers online, or renovation loans for first-time home owners who have bought a place through an online property search listing. The point is to be relevant.</p><p>Matchmaking service</p><p>The platform concept can also apply to commercial banking. HSBC has started a matchmaking service for Singapore businesses to interact with potential overseas partners who are also HSBC clients, solving a need to match businesses that are also kosher by the bank's compliance standards.</p><p>Banks have always had a rich repository of digital data which makes it worthwhile to be more targeted in their approach, as Big Tech firms do. Operating in stiff regulation environment possibly works in the industry's favour today, too. Banks have been regulated for years on data security that their de rigueur utility of customer data should make them less foolhardy and brash than Big Tech competitors, which are now increasingly under pressure to show more responsible use of their algorithms.</p><p>There are signs as well that regulators would level the playing field to allow banks to sell non-banking services that are complementary to banking. Regulators in Singapore have already provided some wiggle room. DBS has taken advantage of it to team up with sgCar-Mart this year to launch an online marketplace for cars.</p><p>Beyond banking</p><p>But there's an important caveat in this. Regulators would have to provide room for banks to expand beyond banking if this improves the health of the financial system.</p><p>Indeed, if technology lowers the cost of banking, customers and the economy can benefit. But one impact to watch is the extent at which the use of Big Data and the transformation of banks into platform companies would mean for financial inclusion. If technology employed by banks widens inequality and cause social instability, regulators are likely to be less accommodative in the years ahead.</p><p>Mondegreens - as when listeners misinterpreted the chorus of Chain of Fools from mishearing its lyrics - occur when auditory perception blurs, and the listeners' brains interpret the ambiguity using their own context. In the fight between Big Tech and banks, the odds can be similarly ambiguous.</p><p>But banks that have already done their soul-searching have a fighting chance in the murk. Take it from the Lady of Soul herself, who made clear her defiance. Sock it to me, dared she.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-185651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8P-KRR1-JCF2-809C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 28, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In addition to the ongoing travails in the United Kingdom and increasing margin pressure in the business bank, Chaney discussed a third issue that will resonate with leadership teams across the banking sector and much of corporate Australia: dealing with digital disruption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Overall, if I think about challenges for banks going forward, one of the largest ones is in regard to the digital space,\" Chaney said. \"The future is unknown, obviously, but it is clear there will be challenges to different parts of the banks' businesses and that is something you need to equip yourself for... the challenge for banks will be to ensure they achieve growth and an increase in shareholder value as they go forward in the face of disruptive competitors.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thorburn also addressed the importance of digital. NAB's new boss described it as \"a core part of our business\" because \"it is so crucial to customers' day-to-day experiences\". Other banks are thinking along similar lines.</p><p>In its submission to the Murray inquiry released on Friday, Westpac Banking Corp pointed to a fivefold increase in customers using its mobile channels in the past two years (59 million sessions in FY2011 up to 253 million in FY2013).</p><p>\"The introduction of increasingly sophisticated mobile devices has led to a trend of 'consumerisation' of financial services. Customers have become increasingly empowered, expecting their providers to match their preferences, rather than providers' own processes,\" Westpac said. Digital transactions boom</p><p>Commonwealth Bank of Australiaalso highlighted the growth of digital interactions in its submission to the financial system inquiry. CBA processed more than 400 million transactions via the internet in FY2013 with more than 60 per cent of NetBank logins via mobile devices.</p><p>Its new CommBank smartphone application launched in December last year has been downloaded by a million people and the bank said for 40 per cent of people using the app, it is the only way they interface with the bank online.</p><p>While advancement in digital technology provides the banks with opportunity, it also presents dangers. CBA chief executive Ian Narev told ASIC's annual forum dinner last month a recent trip to Palo Alto and Seattle visiting global technology companies revealed little clarity about the direction digital business was heading.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty, banks are forging ahead to improve their technological capabilities - partly as a defensive mechanism to protect retail banking market share from potential competition from the large technology companies.</p><p>The banks know these tech players boast large customer bases and can use big data to analyse transaction habits. They fear losing control of customer relationships, the beating heart of banking.</p><p>As an article in the Harvard Business Review observed last month: \"The risk for banks is that new competitors will consign them to a limited role as back-office utilities, while non-banks become the new face of their customers' financial lives.Commercial penetration needed</p><p>\"Banks cannot respond to these threats simply by being more digital, that is, closing down branches and rolling out better mobile and online banking services. If they want to defend their turf against the Googles and PayPals of the world, they themselves must move further ito the commercial lives of their customers. They must learn to play a greater role, not just at the moment of financial transactions, but before and afterwards as well.\"</p><p>A comprehensive research report released last week by JPMorgan banking analyst Scott Manning, in collaboration with Digital Finance Analytics' Martin North -Harnessing the digital revolution: Can technology bypass traditional barriers to entry? - said the sharemarket was not factoring in the risks posed by the disruptive force of technology to bank profitability and the corresponding threat of new technology entrants.</p><p>\"We would argue that banks are struggling to figure out how to use the rapidly changing technology and customer landscape to provide value to customers. While the previous statement sounds a bit fluffy, the following is not: bank stocks are valued as if their current returns will be retained and grow above inflation in perpetuity. We think the rapid shift in technology and customer preference brings that ito question.\"</p><p>The report classifies bank customers as \"natives\" (naturally digital), \"migrants\" (moving to digital) and \"Luddites\" (not interested in digital), and concludes that both natives and migrants \"have a strong affinity with technology players in a hypothetical digital banking context\". That is, they would be willing to bank with hypothetical PayPal, Apple, Google or Microsoft banks ahead of traditional major bank lenders. Furthermore, Luddites, who still rate major banks highly, are becoming a smaller proportion of customers over the coming decades.Physical presence may be outmoded</p><p>\"Technology companies may be able to use the power of their brand to potentially penetrate retail banking market share without needing to build a physical presence to engender trust,\" Manning says. \"Banks are at risk of being stuck in the past in using the branch network as a defence mechanism. So if new technology entrants can enter retail banking markets without incurring the cost of existing physical networks they may be in a good position to engage natives and quickly accumulate market share.\"</p><p>So, would the tech giants enter banking? The proposition is not far-fetched. Google has already taken an equity stake in the largest US peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club, and recently introduced a plastic debit card for its Google Wallet. Apple has more than 400 million active iTunes accounts linked to credit cards. These are a long way from being fully fledged banks, but their suite of financial products could expand in unknown directions over time.</p><p>The banks could respond in several ways to this. One strategy would be to extend an olive branch and try to convince the technology players to collaborate and become conduits for the distribution of bank products. This could work for the mutual benefit of both. But a more combative approach would be to seek to delay their arrival by ensuring regulatory barriers to entry are raised as high as possible.</p><p>Not surprisingly perhaps, CBA used its submission to Murray to call for technology companies to be regulated like banks. \"New technologies have allowed non-bank entities to provide bank-like and finance-related applications and services without necessarily being regulated the same way as traditional banks,\" CBA said. \"This lack of regulatory consistency increases the risk to customers and to the stability of the financial system.\"</p><p>It's an argument likely to be resisted by new tech players and also retailers who have also been moving in on the banks' turf. In Australia, a variety of retailers offer financial services - Coles, Woolworths, Myer and David Jones issue credit cards; Australia Post, Qantas, Vodafone and Caltex issue stored value cards; while Coles and Woolworths sell general insurance. Yet the retailer offering of financial services in Australia is limited compared with offshore.</p><p>In its submission to the financial system inquiry released on Friday, Coles - which, like the big tech players, gather vast amounts of data on a huge number of customers - warned David Murray not to subject retailers to prudential regulation. \"We hold some concerns that the regulatory framework may incrementally shift to an unintended point, where financially sound and otherwise well-regulated new entrants cannot compete in financial services in the future,\" Coles said. , pointing to the UK and Canada, where non-financial conglomerates have been allowed to conduct financial services without being subjected to capital adequacy standards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tech giants such as Google and Apple could use their strong brand recognition to rival banks.

He went on to talk about how they would beat all the e-commerce players in the marketplace game because he is ready and can afford a free marketplace. I think it was a very interesting and optimistic talk and if you have some spare time, it might be worth watching the full video here.</p><p>This is not about the bank CEO's comments but I observe the same level of confidence in his voice when I speak with some other bank executives. Despite the numerous global reports that banks are at the risk of losing up to 25% of their revenue to FinTech companies within the next few years and comments like Bill Gates' assertion 24 years ago that 'banking is necessary but banks are not,' I do not think Nigerian banks are losing much sleep over FinTechs. I also doubt if any bank has collapsed globally owing to the fact that FinTechs stole their market and I doubt that will be happening soon.</p><p>Don't get it twisted though.</p><p>Publicly, banks make it look like they are concerned about FinTech disruption and they should be, but behind closed doors, I do not think that their worry is much about the FinTech companies springing up in Nigeria.</p><p>If you notice from my earlier assertion that the GTBank boss made reference to two global tech companies (Apple Pay and Paypal that aren't even very active in the market yet) and not one Nigerian FinTech company. The reason for this is because the banks know that they have some strong inherent advantages that startups that are seeking to disrupt them will struggle to overturn. However, there are companies that have similar advantages and might pose a threat but they are not necessarily the FinTech startups. With my experience in the FinTech space in Nigeria so far, I know that as long as banks dominate on deposits, lending, payments and investing, they will be around for a while. The struggle for FinTechs remains the ability to achieve enough scale independently to the point of actually displacing the banks. But before we go too far, what are these inherent advantages that are making the banks overbearing?</p><p>Trust (Established Relationship)</p><p>Trust is a very valuable currency in the world today, more-so in the financial world. Even though a lot of customers think their banks are sloppy, they still trust that the banks will be around for a long time and they will have their money whenever they need it. This trust has been built over the years due to established customer relationships and the guarantee of the government through regulation (CBN, NDIC). This is the first subtle feature that takes time to build and very difficult to beat.</p><p>Scale</p><p>By the very nature of banking business, banks need to be big to be successful. They need to be able to pay for the right infrastructure, people, processes and systems that are required as a highly-regulated entity and more importantly, they need a balance sheet that is strong enough to withstand economic stress. The bigger the bank, the more the confidence as a result of the varied spread of assets and base of deposits and considering the fact that no matter the bank size, the same compliance and standards are required. The scale also enables the banks to offer a variety of products under the same umbrella thereby diversifying their revenue base and limiting their risk.</p><p>Regulation</p><p>The financial services space is a highly regulated industry. This is permissible because of how strategic the banking sector is to the economy. Banks understand and help craft regulation and employ hundreds of people to ensure they're complying with regulatory guidelines. While on the surface, this is supposed to be a disadvantage as it increases their cost structure, it puts existing banks at an almost untouchable level because it gives them all the advantages inherent in an oligopolistic market and makes it very difficult for real disruption to happen from outside.</p><p>Customer Base and Distribution</p><p>There are about 65 million active bank customers with about 108 million individual and corporate accounts in Nigeria spread across approximately 21 banks, that's an average of 3 million customers per bank (according to NIBSS as at end of March 2018). The numbers are not a lot if you consider Nigeria's estimated population but if you look at those actual numbers, they're not small. No pure FinTech company has a customer base close to that, in fact, no tech company in Nigeria with such customer base easily comes to mind. Customer acquisition is hard and expensive and this is something the banks have been able to find a way around over the years. What this means is that banks have ubiquitous distribution through branches and other channels and can distribute products to a wide spread of people, businesses and even government, access cheap deposit and build a large balance sheet.</p><p>Cash</p><p>Beyond scale and customer base, the banking industry is one of the most profitable industries in Nigeria. And Nigerian banks are some of the most profitable (in terms of profit margins) in the world. In 2017, Zenith Bank recorded a profit of N157 billion after tax, GTB was N170 billion, Access Bank did N80 billion, UBA was 78.6 billion. In the same 2017, The whole startup ecosystem in Nigeria was reported to have raised about $114.6 million which is less than the 2017 profit of any of this singular banks. Although this might not be a good comparison, the point here is peradventure the disruption battle becomes a cash battle between banks and tech startups (which usually becomes the case), Nigerian FinTech companies don't seem ready yet.</p><p>Data</p><p>I strongly believe Nigerian banks do not currently do enough with the enormous customer data at their disposal and I had written about it in a previous post. Data is another major goldmine that the banks are seating on and it portends a lot of opportunities for them when they decide to start paying attention to it. The thing about data is that it has to be large enough to make sense. Data also has a network effect, so even if a startup has all the cash in the world, they can't just easily go and buy the same data and building such a database takes time.</p><p>Domain Expertise</p><p>This is something that is unusually overlooked and underrated. The business of banking is not as simple as we make it look and just being able to write codes and speak some finance jargons doesn't mean you really understand how banking works and that you will kill all the banks. Banks have built decades of experience and have unique expertise in areas such as credit underwriting underpinned both by data and judgment, asset allocation, liquidity management, risk assessment and many other areas that most FinTech companies lack competency in. This experience will come to bear when push comes to shove and when it's time to build a sustainable and profitable financial services business.</p><p>I am sure any banker reading this by now will probably be feeling pompous and be like 'Abegi, wetin all these FinTechs dey do sef? They can't disrupt jack!' But wait, while I honestly believe these strong advantages means that banks aren't most likely to be killed by FinTechs, there are companies that are in a better position to take on the banks and have the potential to make the banks irrelevant much earlier than anyone can imagine because such companies also possess some of the key attributes that make the banks tick.</p><p>A New Type of Disruptor</p><p>There are two categories of companies that don't get enough attention and aren't the typical disruptors you think about when you're talking about banks being disrupted.</p><p>The first sets are the telcos. This is an obvious one that African banks are very wary of as we have seen the example with mobile money majorly popularised with the success and impact of M-Pesa in Kenya and other telco mobile money offerings in other African markets. If you consider the structure of telcos, they have the brand recognition, scale, the distribution, data, cash, and can also meet the regulatory requirements similar to such that is required of the banks. Perhaps their weak point is lack of expertise/knowledge in the financial services space but this is something they can catch up with within a short time.</p><p>The second category of companies is even a more likely and bigger threat than anticipated. The companies are the big international technology giants like Apple, Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, WeChat, and co. These companies do not only have the advantages that the banks have, they even have a stronger inherent advantage. Let's consider some of this advantages one by one.</p><p>Larger Customer Base, Scale and Distribution</p><p>The big tech companies arguably have the largest customer base of any business category in the world. I can't think of any other company that can boast of over 2 billion registered users globally apart from Facebook or any other company that has the penetration level of Google. Bringing it home, it can be estimated that Facebook has about 50 million active users in Nigeria across their different platforms. This number is more than the stipulated number of Unique BVNs linked to Bank Accounts of 45 million (BVN is Nigeria's Bank Verification Number). This is an unbeatable pool of customers to distribute products and services.</p><p>Network Effects</p><p>The network effect is a concept whereby a platform becomes more valuable for members as new customers join the platform. With this feature, it becomes pretty easy for these tech companies to not just grow really fast but to build another moat that even the banks cannot compete with.</p><p>A Large Cash Base</p><p>The tech companies don't just have the scale and network effects, they also have loads of cash to play and experiment with. Apple had a cash reserve of $285 billion as at December 2017, (that's more than half the GDP of Nigeria), Facebook has over $25 billion, Google has about $90 billion, similar amounts for Amazon, Microsoft and co. These companies are the only few companies globally that can outspend the banks if/when the race for offering financial services to customers becomes a battle of cash.</p><p>A Strong and Reliable Brand</p><p>In Nigeria today, one can argue that Facebook is more popular than a lot of the banking brand considering that there are people who know Facebook and Google even when they've never used the internet. The strong brand recognition that these companies have built means that they don't even have to do too much to get customers to trust them with their money.</p><p>Customer Experience DNA</p><p>The big tech giants are special when it comes to customer experience. They have been able to scale to an enormous size while maintaining a strong user experience focus that banks can't even come close to. Where the banks have had to make a trade-off between scale and user experience, the tech companies have been able to brilliantly operate at the intersection of both and a major reason this is possible is that they have been able to properly leverage data.</p><p>Data</p><p>Despite the recent privacy and data concerns and the increasing customer awareness to the enormous amount of data that the big tech companies have about everyone, it doesn't seem like so many people have a choice or are able to do much about it. While the banks have some insightful financial data about consumers, the data that the big tech giants have on customers makes the bank data look like child's play. Imagine how tailored and super relevant the financial products and services will be with the amount of data these companies already have.</p><p>While I think this is something every bank should really be thinking about, the consolation for Nigerian banks is that Nigeria is not that much of priority for a lot of the big tech companies because they are still very busy making giant strides across developed markets and disrupting other industries that their impact or threat on the financial services industry isn't so worrisome yet. But we cannot deny the fact that these companies are coming and have what it takes to make a significant dent on the financial services industry more than the FinTech companies, if and when they choose to participate.</p><p>I think there is a more proactive solution that happens at the intersection of banks and FinTechs.</p><p>While banks might be strong on their own, I believe they can be made significantly stronger and in a better position to maintain future relevance with the adoption and incorporation of new innovations that are being introduced by startups.</p><p>There is also a major weakness in the banks that FinTechs are well suited to tackle head-on.</p><p>The scale of banks means that they are generalists, so there's usually a trade-off. While scale reduces risk, it also means that the banks don't get to delight a specific set of customers. It is essentially because of this lack of focus and deficiencies in customer services that FinTech companies have come on board to focus on specific areas of financial services and try to create a better experience for the customers.</p><p>The biggest advantage for FinTechs is the ability to bring transparency, efficiency and better user experience to every area where the traditional banks have been offering below par services to customers. FinTechs are able to do this because of a focused approach that ensures products are well tailored to meet customer's specific needs, a low cost structure that makes it possible to offer more affordable rates, lack of legacy structures and over-regulation that enables them serve segments of the market ignored by the banks and a nimble disposition that provides the speed to move faster and incorporate the latest trends and innovation in product and service delivery.</p><p>While it remains a struggle for FinTechs to achieve scale independently, banks struggle to delight their customers and are at the threat of being made irrelevant by telcos and popular global tech companies.</p><p>My submission, therefore, is that it is really hard to disrupt banks. FinTechs are innovating the financial services space but aren't necessarily disrupting as much as we all like to think. The real disruption to banks in Africa and even globally is more likely to come from telcos and global tech giants than from typical pure FinTechs. I believe that the best bet for banks and FinTechs to stand a good chance of retaining relevance in the future is to work together. The FinTechs have one or two things to teach the banks about new customer expectations and digital transformation and the banks can help FinTech companies scale and build sustainable and viable businesses. A partnership offers the banks a potential path to new markets, new products and growth opportunities. This is not new because most of the 'successful FinTech startups' in Africa today have some form of strong bank affiliations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY24052018000510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDB-VYT1-JCH9-G1W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 24, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp; Commercial Accounts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzEwQUY2QkM5RDFFNDRGNDlBRURGRTgyMkZFRkE0Rjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBODUyMzhBNzc4NDZDNEE4RjRCRUQ2QzJDMDg2QjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Commercial Law (UCC)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI5QjdCNzBDNjY0NEY3QzlGRTNCQTMzQ0IwQ0MzRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzZFMDNGNTY2MjVBNDI2REE1QzY4QzBDNDVCMkZFRkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIzQzFDMzEwMEUxNEZGN0EyQUYwOUI2QTIwOEM2MjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DG3K</classCode><className>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001080</classCode><className>MARKET SHARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX238</classCode><className>LAGOS, NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Sim Tshabalala, chief executive of the Stand...</p><p>The South African financial services landscape is likely to become unrecognisable in the near future as many new banking entrants and fintech platforms challenge both existing business models and the status quo.   Sim Tshabalala, chief executive of the Standard Bank Group told a GIBS forum he anticipated dramatic changes in the ways banks operated and the products they offered to customers across their retail, commercial and investment platforms.   \u201cI cannot yet tell you what the bank of the future will look like in five to 10 years time,\u201d Tshabalala said.   Digitisation and the future of banking    Widespread digitisation across industries has meant consumer expectations of what banks deliver is largely determined by technology, Tshabalala explained.   Fintech platforms and new entrants to the payments space such as Facebook\u2019s Libra will have interesting consequences for the global and South African financial services industry.   \u201cThey are all our competitors now, not just the other banks. It is a brave new world we are entering.\u201d   While the competition for retail customers driven by new technology offerings has received much attention, it is in fact the revenues in the corporate and investment banking space, as well as insurance and asset management that are most under threat from fintechs and big techs, Tshabalala said.    \u201cI am terrified of big tech and fintechs in that space. As new entrants, they are disruptive and are creating new value propositions that are attractive to clients,\u201d he said.   However, while Tshabalala conceded these new forces will change the financial services industry, he argued that the incumbents have yet to respond fully, and that when they did, they would be very difficult to compete with.   \u201cI have confidence in the banks. They will be here in five to 10 years time. They will look different, but they will be in existence. It is the way that things are done that will change.\u201d   [embedded content]   Tshabalala said the winners in the new banking environment would be those banks that are able to respond appropriately to the new product offerings. Banks need to find ways to make sure that their customer experience, systems and products are as good as those provided by platforms, and at the same low price point.   \u201cNew entrants into the banking space will force greater competition, which is good for customers and good for society,\u201d he said.   Standard Bank\u2019s response to new technologies and entrants is to partner with fintechs and develop products that will enable them to remain relevant and competitive.   Tshabalala explained the bank is \u201cspending a lot of time and money to put ourselves in a position which will enable us to compete\u201d by entering into collaborations to develop cloud, block chain, robotics and AI capabilities.   While these shifts will have profound implications, Tshabalala said he doesn\u2019t believe banking jobs will be decimated, but that rather different jobs would emerge.   \u201cEntirely new job categories are being created all the time, and banking is fundamentally a human industry. We will still need people with empathy.\u201d   He added that there was an urgent need for a dialogue between government, business, labour and the universities to determine what skills the country and corporates need, as many skills such as IT were still being imported, rather than sourced from among local graduates.   \u201cWe are still importing so many skills, while Johannesburg and Cape Town are quickly becoming leading fintech hubs that are able to compete with the likes of London and Berlin.\u201d   Regulation obligation    There is not much to differentiate a platform and a bank at present, as both have large networks. However, banks are regulated in terms of liquidity and capital adequacy requirements, rules that do not currently apply to fintech and big tech as they don\u2019t have banking licences, Tshabalala explained.   \u201cFortunately, the approach of the South African Reserve Bank is to regulate on the basis of activity, so if you are a deposit taker, you are expected to have a banking licence, and if you enter the payment system, there are certain requirements that you are expected to meet. But, there are loopholes in South Africa and massive loopholes in Africa that can be exploited,\u201d he said.   [embedded content]   Furthermore, he warned \u201cmany of these entities introduce risks into the system which is disproportionate to the benefits that they bring. My argument is that if it behaves like a bank, it needs to be regulated like a bank.\u201d   Facebook\u2019s Libra payment system poses potential risks to the value chain, Tshabalala argued: \u201cMy earnest hope is that it gets regulated properly and appropriately as it is a formidable partnership.\u201d   African opportunities    Tshabalala described Standard Bank as \u201ca company with resilience\u201d that decided to focus on becoming a regional player after the 2008 financial crisis by disposing of interests outside of the African continent.   [embedded content]   With a presence in 20 countries on the continent, the bank\u2019s operations outside of South Africa now contribute a third of the company\u2019s revenue. \u201cOur competitors don\u2019t have our network on the ground, and it cannot be easily replicated,\u201d he added.   However, big tech and platform players are in South Africa, and \u201care thinking very carefully about what to do here and on the continent. South Africa is a great base off which to exploit the opportunities here and in Africa, and the opportunities are vast,\u201d he concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42603947379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C3-WT91-JCSC-J4XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>City Press - News24</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That kind of activity, particularly the manipulation of behaviour, is \"repugnant,\" he said.</p><p>McNamee pointed to Sri Lanka, which banned social media sites in the wake of a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks, as an example. That ban lasted nine days and was an attempt to stop people from spreading misinformation, confusion and inciting violence in the days after the attacks.</p><p>McNamee's proposal was just one of the ideas pitched at the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy held in Ottawa on Tuesday. The committee is part of a worldwide effort to bring massive companies like Google and Facebook to heel on such issues as privacy, hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>With Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's absence illustrated by an empty committee chair - a piece of Westminster theatre that also played out at the first meeting of the grand committee in the United Kingdom last fall - politicians considered the possibility of subjecting the social media magnate to personal liability for corporate decisions, a measure recommended by Research in Motion founder Jim Balsillie.</p><p>\"I guarantee you that sobers the mind and introduces a kind of prudence and conservatism into their behaviour,\" said Balsillie, who came to the hearing bearing an arsenal of ideas, including banning targeted advertising during the election campaign altogether.</p><p>\"During elections we have a lot of things you're not allowed to do for six or eight weeks. Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie.</p><p>The discussion about the ban comes on the heels of Google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Members of the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy listen as Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Chair Bob Zimmer, third from right, responds to a question during a news conference in Ottawa, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what Google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin McKay, Google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact that Canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. One of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as Google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. Angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like Ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers.</p><p>Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" said Erskine-Smith.</p><p>Backlash after Facebook agrees Nancy Pelosi video is fake but declines to delete it( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/backlash-after-facebook-agrees-pelosi-video-is-fake-but-declines-to-delete-it\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/backlash-after-facebook-agrees-pelosi-video-is-fake-but-declines-to-delete-it</url> )</p><p>A pregnant woman is murdered, her baby cut from her body.

The committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and Sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said Angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>.

That kind of activity, particularly the manipulation of behaviour, is \"repugnant,\" he said.</p><p>McNamee pointed to Sri Lanka, which banned social media sites in the wake of a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks, as an example. That ban lasted nine days and was an attempt to stop people from spreading misinformation, confusion and inciting violence in the days after the attacks.</p><p>McNamee's proposal was just one of the ideas pitched at the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy held in Ottawa on Tuesday. The committee is part of a worldwide effort to bring massive companies like Google and Facebook to heel on such issues as privacy, hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>With Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's absence illustrated by an empty committee chair - a piece of Westminster theatre that also played out at the first meeting of the grand committee in the United Kingdom last fall - politicians considered the possibility of subjecting the social media magnate to personal liability for corporate decisions, a measure recommended by Research in Motion founder Jim Balsillie.</p><p>\"I guarantee you that sobers the mind and introduces a kind of prudence and conservatism into their behaviour,\" said Balsillie, who came to the hearing bearing an arsenal of ideas, including banning targeted advertising during the election campaign altogether.</p><p>\"During elections we have a lot of things you're not allowed to do for six or eight weeks. Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie.</p><p>The discussion about the ban comes on the heels of Google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Members of the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy listen as Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Chair Bob Zimmer, third from right, responds to a question during a news conference in Ottawa, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what Google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin McKay, Google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact that Canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. One of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as Google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said New Democratic Party MP Charlie Angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. Angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like Ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers.</p><p>Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" said Erskine-Smith.</p><p>Backlash after Facebook agrees Nancy Pelosi video is fake but declines to delete it( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/backlash-after-facebook-agrees-pelosi-video-is-fake-but-declines-to-delete-it\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/backlash-after-facebook-agrees-pelosi-video-is-fake-but-declines-to-delete-it</url> )</p><p>A pregnant woman is murdered, her baby cut from her body. Her family blames a Facebook post( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/body-found-confirmed-to-be-missing-pregnant-chicago-woman\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/body-found-confirmed-to-be-missing-pregnant-chicago-woman</url> )</p><p>Committee blasts Zuckerberg, Sandberg for 'abhorrent' snub of Ottawa hearing( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/balsillie-decries-toxic-unchecked-technology-at-big-data-committee\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/balsillie-decries-toxic-unchecked-technology-at-big-data-committee</url> )</p><p>The privacy committee had argued for even more transparency around political advertising that would allow people to see how the targeting mechanisms work, and Erskine-Smith said that could be a good compromise for political ads.</p><p>Facebook's representative in Canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"The parliament of Canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"In many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British MP Ian Lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said Angus. The committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and Sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said Angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>.
