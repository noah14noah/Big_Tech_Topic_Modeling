The move came just a few days after privacy commissioners in Ottawa and British Columbia concluded a lengthy investigation into a Canadian company implicated in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.</p><p>The probe found that B.C.-based AggregateIQ had broken privacy laws in its handling of a massive trove of Facebook data that was used for political messaging purposes without proper consent, but that the regulators had no power to levy fines against the firm.</p><p>Rempel called the lack of fines a failure of government and said returning minister Navdeep Bains - whose Liberal government released a Digital Charter in the run-up to the federal election laying out a series of broad intentions such as \"A level playing field\" and \"Strong Enforcement and Real Accountability\" - has failed to enact meaningful regulation.</p><p>\"We're beyond that. I mean, you have to look at Google in the same way we'd look at a company like Monsanto or DuPont in terms of regulating their operations to make sure that the environment is safe while jobs are created. Just the context is different,\" Rempel said.</p><p>\"The AggregateIQ outcome is a perfect example of this failure. Because if the Digital Charter actually worked, or had any sort of teeth to it, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.\"</p><p>Postmedia made multiple interview requests to Bains'office in the wake of the AggregateIQ report, but the minister was not made available.</p><p>\"Our competitiveness depends on our ability to use digital innovation to harness the power of data, but not at the expense of Canadians'trust,\" spokeswoman Dani Keenan said in a statement sent on Bains' behalf. \"That's why, earlier this year, Minister Bains unveiled Canada's Digital Charter, which outlines 10 key principles for continued Canadian leadership in the digital and data driven economy.\"</p><p>Around the world, the gold-standard for data and privacy regulation has been GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the European regulatory behemoth that caused a lot of excitement in 2018. However, since coming into force the law has faced heavy criticism for being too cumbersome and difficult to enforce.</p><p>In the United States, much of the conversation has focused on antitrust, and the possibility of breaking up the biggest tech companies.</p><p>Rempel said she doesn't favour either of those approaches.</p><p>She wouldn't get into the specific policy proposals the Conservatives plan on putting forward, but she said that the minority Parliament gives a chance for opposition parties to drive the agenda. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Osprey Media Group Inc.

A chilling tale of how vulnerable we are to cyber threats. Today, technology is completely embedded in every aspect of our lives. Yet, the more apps and devices we use, the less we know about their workings. The biggest risk is ceding control of our lives to Big Tech - the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon. We are sifting through so many versions of truth about these platforms that it is hard to tell the real from the imagined.</p><p>We were not always disconnected from the technical innards of the machines we used. When I was learning to drive a car, my father first taught me the inner workings of the car. Now our environment friendly Tesla has much simpler mechanics, but a lot more software that is Greek to me. This is less a reflection of our inability to absorb all things technical, but more about the growing complexity of software. The extent of our technical prowess involves actions like accept, click, like, share and comment, some of which lands us in thick soup, like phishing incidents.</p><p>Today, cybercrime is real. In developing and developed countries, hackers have preyed on unsuspecting senior citizens to part with their money, OTP or passwords.Yet, it is not just the elderly who are victims of cybercrimes.</p><p>A recent report from a cyber security company reveals that criminals can sell our personal data amounting to our entire digital life for as little as $50. The only way individuals can deal with this organised crime is by increasing their security awareness. The US Congressional hearings with Big Tech leaders such as Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg, revealed the depth of ignorance among senators about technologies that have already matured.</p><p>Policy makers and legislators should first learn about technologies before they can start to effectively regulate it in a nuanced manner. Is there any wonder that the UAE has appointed a Minister for Artificial Intelligence? Some countries are training their entire population to gain a competitive edge. Finland has a nationwide programme to educate citizens on Artificial Intelligence through online courses designed for the non-IT populace. The Scandinavian government is preparing the country to compete with China and US for building practical applications of AI. These competencies will allow its citizens to also weigh in on AI policy making.</p><p>From prehistoric times, we have used our versatile abilities to survive and thrive through ecological disruptions. Paleoanthropologists believe that our forefathers survived where their distant cousins the Neanderthals did not, largely because the Homo Sapiens were generalist specialists, who could adapt to and specialise in living in extremely different habitats. Specialist species became extinct as their unique habitats were destroyed.</p><p>Fast forward to the 21st century; almost all professional fields require us to be specialists. Doctors even need to be super specialists to adapt to an ever changing medical landscape. While presenting my views at an event for doctors and surgeons, I wondered why an august gathering of medical specialists had so much interest in information technology. Evidently, they recognised the need to understand and adapt to a digital world.</p><p>The Renaissance Age was replete with successful polymaths who had expertise in wildly different fields such as art, science, literature, architecture and philosophy.</p><p>Not all of us have to emulate Leonardo Da Vinci, but we can certainly make an attempt to decipher the fundamentals of technologies such as Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Internet of Things that will shape our lives in more ways than we can imagine. Looking ahead, when drones would be flying over our heads delivering our online purchases, and our digital assistant would know exactly when to book our doctor's appointment, we should not lose our capacity to learn about what makes them tick.</p><p>Shalini Verma is the CEO of PIVOT Technologies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-135669379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7S-RH11-F11P-X1DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

A chilling tale of how vulnerable we are to cyber threats. Today, technology is completely embedded in every aspect of our lives. </p><p>Yet, the more apps and devices we use, the less we know about their workings. The biggest risk is ceding control of our lives to Big Tech - the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon. We are sifting through so many versions of truth about these platforms that it is hard to tell the real from the imagined. We were not always disconnected from the technical innards of the machines we used. When I was learning to drive a car, my father first taught me the inner workings of the car. Now our environment friendly Tesla has much simpler mechanics, but a lot more software that is Greek to me. This is less a reflection of our inability to absorb all things technical, but more about the growing complexity of software. The extent of our technical prowess involves actions like accept, click, like, share and comment, some of which lands us in thick soup, like phishing incidents. Today, cybercrime is real. In developing and developed countries, hackers have preyed on unsuspecting senior citizens to part with their money, OTP or passwords. Yet, it is not just the elderly who are victims of cybercrimes. A recent report from a cyber security company reveals that criminals can sell our personal data amounting to our entire digital life for as little as $50. The only way individuals can deal with this organised crime is by increasing their security awareness. The US Congressional hearings with Big Tech leaders such as Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg, revealed the depth of ignorance among senators about technologies that have already matured. Policy makers and legislators should first learn about technologies before they can start to effectively regulate it in a nuanced manner. Some countries are training their entire population to gain a competitive edge. Finland has a nationwide programme to educate citizens on Artificial Intelligence through online courses designed for the non-IT populace. The Scandinavian government is preparing the country to compete with China and US for building practical applications of AI. These competencies will allow its citizens to also weigh in on AI policy making. From prehistoric times, we have used our versatile abilities to survive and thrive through ecological disruptions. Paleoanthropologists believe that our forefathers survived where their distant cousins the Neanderthals did not, largely because the Homo Sapiens were generalist specialists, who could adapt to and specialise in living in extremely different habitats. Specialist species became extinct as their unique habitats were destroyed. Fast forward to the 21st century; almost all professional fields require us to be specialists. Doctors even need to be super specialists to adapt to an ever changing medical landscape. While presenting my views at an event for doctors and surgeons, I wondered why an august gathering of medical specialists had so much interest in information technology. Evidently, they recognised the need to understand and adapt to a digital world. The Renaissance Age was replete with successful polymaths who had expertise in wildly different fields such as art, science, literature, architecture and philosophy. Not all of us have to emulate Leonardo Da Vinci, but we can certainly make an attempt to decipher the fundamentals of technologies such as Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Internet of Things that will shape our lives in more ways than we can imagine. Looking ahead, when drones would be flying over our heads delivering our online purchases, and our digital assistant would know exactly when to book our doctor's appointment, we should not lose our capacity to learn about what makes them tick.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

British Gas was a first mover in this business, launching a separate unit in 2007 and acquiring companies with expertise in solar cells, smart meters and heat pumps. But most utilities have limited competitive advantage over traditional retailers and digital players in this area.

I will admit a soft spot for a good GIF based on the classic\u00a0Battlestar Galactica\u00a0catchphrase[3], 'All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.' </p><p>Seems appropriate given how the TV show was about a technology backlash that keeps happening over and over again. The Use of Technology Is Affecting Our Lives And so it is with concerns about the social consequences of media tech. The 17th-century French scholar Adrien Baillet\u00a0fretted[4]\u00a0that 'the multitude of books which grows every day in prodigious fashion' would destroy civilization, just like the 'fall of the Roman Empire.' The early days of radio spawned fears that the\u00a0'compelling excitement of the loudspeaker'[5]\u00a0would distract children from their homework. Unsurprisingly, all that enhanced power of access and collaboration has downsides. In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow\u00a0famously complained[6]\u00a0that television was a 'vast wasteland,' often little more than 'a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western bad men, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons.' (Of course to modern sensibilities, that all probably sounds pretty good. Especially a show called\u00a0Blood and Thunder). Just recently, I\u00a0wrote[7]\u00a0about spurious claims that\u00a0Halo 3\u00a0and\u00a0Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\u00a0explain why young men don't work more. Now, a decade after the iPhone made its debut, people are discovering that smartphones and apps aren't immune to the notion of trade-offs. Yes, the mobile technology revolution is a transformative event that gives billions of individuals easy access to humanity's stock of knowledge through a small pane of glass in their pockets. The data being generated will help fight crime, epidemics, and traffic. In developing nations, more mobile phones mean more connectedness and economic growth. Sounds pretty good. But, unsurprisingly, all that enhanced power of access and collaboration has downsides. After some former Facebook executives\u00a0expressed guilt[8]\u00a0for building a platform dependent on 'dopamine-driven feedback loops' and designed to foster dependence, the company acknowledged that some types of social media use could harm users' mental health. The Trade-off Game Activists\u00a0are now complaining[9]\u00a0that Apple doesn't do enough to give parents sufficient control over their children's iPhones. They want the company to take more seriously the potential mental-health impact of kids spending so much time on their devices. The end result of this upturn in concern will probably be more intuitive phone controls and better apps for parents. Or as a clickbait headline in a\u00a0viral\u00a0Atlantic\u00a0piece[10]\u00a0recently put it, 'Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?' The story presents some data suggesting that smartphones have made the cohort between 1995 and 2012 \u2014 iGen, as the author calls them \u2014 more psychologically 'vulnerable' and 'seriously unhappy.' But ultimately that headline conforms to Betteridge's law: 'Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.' iGen is not yet a generation destroyed. Yes, the data show teens today are more likely to say they feel lonely than in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced. But in so many other ways they seem healthier,\u00a0reporting[11]\u00a0lower rates of drug use, less violence, and safer sexual behavior. Millennials overall are also pretty\u00a0optimistic[12]\u00a0about the future. The government isn't going to ban smartphones for the under 18 crowd. The end result of this upturn in concern will probably be more intuitive phone controls and better apps for parents, as well as for those adults who have trouble staying off Twitter. And then we can return to wondering if AI-infused robots or AI-enhanced humans will\u00a0gobble up[13]\u00a0all of society's jobs and wealth. That is a best-case scenario. A less-welcome, though lower probability, outcome is if the burgeoning\u00a0anti-tech movement[14]\u00a0successfully weaponizes these mild health and safety concerns in its effort to dismantle or heavily regulate the mega-platforms and other large, successful tech firms, which suffered a PR annus horribilis in 2017. Big Tech's strong counterargument has until now been that they are providing customers with valued products. It's why Jeff Bezos is now a centibillionaire. But what if that product is widely thought to be bad for consumers? All that economic value suddenly looks a bit less valuable, and Big Tech just begins to resemble Big Tobacco.

A series of scandals revolving around how tech companies collect, store, and share data dominated news coverage for a number of weeks. But any hope these companies may have had that 2019 would be an easier ride was quickly dismissed with the recent announcement of a $57 million fine slapped upon Google by France's data protection authority, CNIL. </p><p>According to CNIL, Google was fined for \"lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ads personalization.\" This constitutes the first significant violation of Europe's recently implemented General Data Protection Regulation, a law meant to protect Internet users from having their data collected, shared or used without their explicit consent. Google didn't indicate if it would appeal the decision, but a spokesman did say that the company would alter its practices to comply with the GDPR. This is not Google's first slap down from the European authorities. Antitrust regulators fined the company $2.7 billion in 2017 and an additional $5 billion in 2018 for manipulating search algorithms to promote its own products and for pushing its software bundles on Android phone makers, respectively. Both of those decisions are being appealed. CNIL's fine of $57 million is comparatively a drop in the bucket for Google. Google makes well over $100 million per day, so it'll be just fine financially. But what this fine does demonstrate is that Europe's data protection law has teeth and its regulators are not afraid to stand up to tech giants who abuse their power. CNIL warned that the penalties will keep coming if Google doesn't change its ways. This fine has reignited debate surrounding the implementation of such a law in the United States. In a recent essay for Time magazine, Apple CEO Tim Cook called on Congress to pass federal privacy legislation that would ensure four key rights for users: the right to have the taking of personal data minimized, the right to know what data are being collected and why, the right to access and delete personal data, and the right to data security. These four items would be a great starting place for our representatives when crafting meaningful laws that protect American citizens from tech company overreach. Europe has offered a model for how to get these companies in line and the U.S. would be wise to follow suit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBLADE-24687519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBLADE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG3-MKM1-JC0X-F0RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280840</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Blade All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Toledo Blade (Ohio)</publicationName><edition>FINAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

None. As in not one.</p><p>The Internet has democratized creativity, but this group of Big Tech and Big Media companies and the lawyers and academics who love them is about as undemocratic a \"consensus\" as any artist could imagine.</p><p>Creators are the most affected by the \"Project's\" many proposed changes to copyright law. But creators were apparently not even considered as eligible to participate in discussions with these elites.</p><p>Any number of creators (including me) would have been glad to hash out ideas for reforms. Ideas we get from on-the-ground practical experience. Experience you won't find in the ivory towers of academia or corporate corner offices.</p><p>A Small Example</p><p>Let me give you one small example from the many proposals -- copyright registration and orphan works. Had they been included, photographers could have explained that they typically take hundreds of photographs in a single photo session. The registration recommendation in this report would require photographers to register each and every photograph with a government registry to protect against \"orphaning\"-- the use of a copy of their works by someone who can't seem to find them.</p><p>This registration idea has been around for quite a while. The pitch to artists is never from other artists -- it's usually pitched as a good thing because the Internet would unleash a torrent of untold riches if people could just find you. This must be someone's idea of a joke, because if the Internet has unleashed anything on artists, it is not a torrent of people trying to pay us. It's another kind of torrent--a Bit Torrent.</p><p>This registration issue is tricky -- they can't condition the right to copyright itself on registration because I'm told that would probably violate international law and land the U.S. in yet another arbitration (remember the Fairness in Music Licensing Act?). So a registration just allows your work to be exploited if the people who want to use the work can't find you -- even if they look really, really, really hard. That idea is something that any artist could have told the \"Principles\" elites was ... well, incorrect. Had we been asked.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to find musicians, songwriters and recording artists right now. The problem isn't that we can't be found. The problem is that only the honest people want to look for us.</p><p>The Market Already Has A Real Consensus</p><p>The market has already produced a solution to this. Artists who want to be found have registered with Getty Images, ASCAP, Flickr, BMI, SESAC, SoundExchange or Deviant Art and can continue to do so. Who benefits, then, from this registration requirement?</p><p>Big Tech. A Google lawyer told the Copyright Office that Google was interested in millions of orphans. In these recommendations, the person doing the looking has no incentive to actually find the artist because they benefit economically by failing to find artists.</p><p>Be Skeptically Bipartisan </p><p>Legislators would do well to be deeply skeptical of the \"Principles\", particularly when there is a superior bipartisan approach true to both conservative and liberal core principles.</p><p>Conservatives: There are very real unintended consequences in the \"Principles\", such as reversing the basic precept that if the government exists for anything it is to secure private property rights to the people. Instead, the proposed registry makes government the issuer of a kind of compulsory license.</p><p>Conservatives should also be troubled that these proposals implicitly would collectivize the rights of individual creators. Why stop with copyright? Why not collectivize privacy rights, too, if it benefits Big Data? When have conservatives ever supported such positions?</p><p>Liberals: These proposals are largely unfair to creators. They burden individual creators of modest means with new regulations and expenses while unburdening multinational corporations.</p><p>And guess who is going to pay for these registries? Individual creators who will be required to pay for something they don't want that ultimately hurts them? The already overburdened U.S. taxpayer? Or multinational corporations who are planning to profit from works that are available to exploit if they are not registered. When have liberals abandoned Main Street to protect multinational corporations?</p><p>Register Your Family Albums </p><p>Both conservatives and liberals should be frightened by the \"Principles'\" attempt to \"reformalize\" effective copyright protection by encouraging Goodlatte to take away \"rights and remedies\" for those who do not register their works. Especially those works that the report deems to have \"no commercial value\"--as decided by the elites rather than the market, apparently.</p><p>So if one of the \"users\" the principles seem to think they represent -- like me -- posts a photo of my children on my Facebook page but I don't register it, and somehow a company or individual then uses this picture commercially, or in some other vile manner, this report explicitly states that I would not have the same \"rights and remedies\" that I currently enjoy. In fact my reading of this report says I would have no remedies unless I were to win an argument that my family photos have commercial value -- full employment for lawyers.</p><p>So are we all gonna have to register our family photos with Big Brother in order to keep control of them?</p><p>DMCA Abuse </p><p>Finally, how anyone could have a serious conversation about copyright in the 21st century without addressing the utter abuse of Digital Millennial Copyright Act notice and take-downs to benefit Big Tech and pirates alike? The \"Project's\" failure to even raise this issue is breathtaking.</p><p>For the uninitiated this is a-Whack-a-Mole game of \"notice and shakedown\" that creators can never win. I personally have to issue hundreds of take down notices to infringing sites each day (or hire a service to do this for me). Most of these sites then claim to remove the infringing file, but often within hours the identical file re-appears on the same site.</p><p>Google's own Transparency Report shows Google receives 20,000,000 DMCA take-down notices a month for search alone! Artists simply cannot afford this huge drain on resources to participate in this game of \"catch me if you can.\"</p><p>Only those who live in an ivory tower could be oblivious to this fundamental disregard for property rights.</p><p>I truly believe that this result was never the Congress's intention. I'm sure Goodlatte respects artists as the creative drivers of copyright -- professionals and amateurs alike. Artists have commended him frequently for his support for creators.</p><p>The continuing theme of the \"Principles\" elites is to weaken the rights of artists -- artists who are not represented in the non-consensus consensus. And it's not like they don't know we are around.</p><p>I am confident that Goodlatte will include artists in future discussions in Congress. Not only do we create these works of copyright, but we can provide practical advice for implementing copyright reform on the ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, starting the discussion with an elite group masquerading as a \"consensus\" with selective proposals is a missed opportunity for ending the polarization.</p><p>David Lowery is singer songwriter for the bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven.

That is thanks to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an excellent, belated and sweeping reform. Its provisions, had they only been in force earlier, would have done much to hamper the crooks, snoopers and spivs who have rampaged through the internet's flimsy security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My inbox (and probably yours) gives evidence of the scope for improvement. Messages, panicky and plaintive, are flooding in from companies I have never heard of, begging to be allowed to continue sending emails that I never read.</p><p>That highlights one part of the problem: we have been wildly promiscuous with our personal data. We hand out our email addresses and mobile phone numbers far more readily than we would share our home addresses, though in the wrong hands these electronic co-ordinates can do us a lot more damage than the real-world ones.</p><p>If I have your home address, my options are limited. I can send you junk mail, look through your windows, and in extremis burgle your house.</p><p>In the electronic world, the costs and risks are much lower and the gain greater. Emails and text messages, unlike junk postal letters, cost almost nothing to send and can do real damage, with links and attachments containing malware.</p><p>Click in the wrong place and your computer is infected, meaning a malefactor can steal your money, abuse your privacy, or target your friends. Readers might wish to consider following my approach, of having one email address for sending and receiving messages that actually matter, and another, rather like a PO Box, that can be given out to all and sundry. Treat everything that comes into the public one with scepticism.</p><p>Under GDPR, storing personal data for no reason is illegal. But the swarm of emails highlights another kind of ignorance, among companies, not consumers. Many are unnecessary: the new rules certainly do not prohibit businesses from contacting previous or current customers. For most people sending out emails, the main thing is just to ensure that recipients can unsubscribe easily - for example by having a no-fuss link to click at the bottom of the message. Some of the emails asking for my consent are probably themselves illegal. Amusingly, a few are from law firms touting their expertise on GDPR.</p><p>Where the new rules really bite is on big companies that are careless or secretive. TalkTalk, for example, would have been in even more trouble about its data breach in 2015, which allowed criminals to scam its customers. True, its share price is now down by two thirds, and it paid a record \u00a3400,000 penalty. But under GDPR it could face a fine of up to 4 per cent of its turnover, or about \u00a370 million. The same fines apply to custodians of our data who fail to report breaches of their networks. They have to report them within 72 hours. We also gain an important right to ask companies for all the data they hold about us.</p><p>Prosecutions and court rulings will flesh out the details (lawyers are salivating) but already the GDPR framework is becoming a global standard. In effect, if you want to do business with anyone in the European Union, it applies to you. It makes America's state of cyberfeudalism, in which the rich and powerful call the shots over the digital serfs, look even more anachronistic. Wisely, Britain will stay in the GDPR framework after Brexit.</p><p>But protection of personal data is just part of a much wider set of difficulties. One is the arrogance and irresponsibility of big tech companies such as Facebook. Its naive vision of an interconnected world has unleashed the furies in places like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, where an unfounded allegation shared on social media can whip a mob into a lethal frenzy. Facebook's blithe disregard of the rules on political advertising has probably enabled Russians and others to manipulate elections here and in the US.</p><p>GDPR lays down some basic rules, but we need a much more sophisticated regulatory framework for big tech companies. I suggest strict rules governing advertising: we should be able to see who has paid for an ad and how it is targeted. We should also have easy ways of seeing if we are dealing with real people online, and clear signposts about the authenticity of websites.</p><p>An even bigger problem is deterring the conscious wrongdoers: criminals, hooligans and hostile states. One simple step would be to increase the banks' liability for cybercrime. The latest wave of scams targeting TSB customers works because that ill-run bank's computer systems are not working properly, because its systems do not spot suspicious transactions, and because other banks allow criminals with phoney IDs to open accounts to receive the loot. It also takes a scandalously long time for victims to reach the fraud department, by which time the money is gone. Better security would cost the banks money, but save customers much grief.</p><p>Jeremy Wright, QC, the attorneygeneral, highlighted the risks we face from hostile states in a speech this week, urging stricter application of international law to cyberspace. Yet oddly he found no time to mention the GDPR, which is the best example yet of how international co-operation can raise standards and bring big companies to heel. Perhaps the idea that the EU might do something right is too dangerous for a minister to endorse.</p><p>We need protection from the arrogance of firms like Facebook</p><p>Have one email for messages that matter and another for spam</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-137907136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD9-0TJ1-DY9P-N3T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000858K</classCode><className>DAY COS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS321211 HARDWOOD VENEER &amp;

That is thanks to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an excellent, belated and sweeping reform. Its provisions, had they only been in force earlier, would have done much to hamper the crooks, snoopers and spivs who have rampaged through the internet's flimsy security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My inbox (and probably yours) gives evidence of the scope for improvement. Messages, panicky and plaintive, are flooding in from companies I have never heard of, begging to be allowed to continue sending emails that I never read.</p><p>That highlights one part of the problem: we have been wildly promiscuous with our personal data. We hand out our email addresses and mobile phone numbers far more readily than we would share our home addresses, though in the wrong hands these electronic co-ordinates can do us a lot more damage than the real-world ones.</p><p>If I have your home address, my options are limited. I can send you junk mail, look through your windows, and in extremis burgle your house.</p><p>In the electronic world, the costs and risks are much lower and the gain greater. Emails and text messages, unlike junk postal letters, cost almost nothing to send and can do real damage, with links and attachments containing malware. Click in the wrong place and your computer is infected, meaning a malefactor can steal your money, abuse your privacy, or target your friends. Readers might wish to consider following my approach, of having one email address for sending and receiving messages that actually matter, and another, rather like a PO Box, that can be given out to all and sundry. Treat everything that comes into the public one with scepticism.</p><p>Under GDPR, storing personal data for no reason is illegal. But the swarm of emails highlights another kind of ignorance, among companies, not consumers. Many are unnecessary: the new rules certainly do not prohibit businesses from contacting previous or current customers. For most people sending out emails, the main thing is just to ensure that recipients can unsubscribe easily - for example by having a no-fuss link to click at the bottom of the message. Some of the emails asking for my consent are probably themselves illegal. Amusingly, a few are from law firms touting their expertise on GDPR.</p><p>Where the new rules really bite is on big companies that are careless or secretive. TalkTalk, for example, would have been in even more trouble about its data breach in 2015, which allowed criminals to scam its customers. True, its share price is now down by two thirds, and it paid a record \u00a3400,000 penalty. But under GDPR it could face a fine of up to 4 per cent of its turnover, or about \u00a370 million. The same fines apply to custodians of our data who fail to report breaches of their networks. They have to report them within 72 hours. We also gain an important right to ask companies for all the data they hold about us.</p><p>Prosecutions and court rulings will flesh out the details (lawyers are salivating) but already the GDPR framework is becoming a global standard. In effect, if you want to do business with anyone in the European Union, it applies to you. It makes America's state of cyberfeudalism, in which the rich and powerful call the shots over the digital serfs, look even more anachronistic. Wisely, Britain will stay in the GDPR framework after Brexit.</p><p>But protection of personal data is just part of a much wider set of difficulties. One is the arrogance and irresponsibility of big tech companies such as Facebook. Its naive vision of an interconnected world has unleashed the furies in places like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, where an unfounded allegation shared on social media can whip a mob into a lethal frenzy. Facebook's blithe disregard of the rules on political advertising has probably enabled Russians and others to manipulate elections here and in the US.</p><p>GDPR lays down some basic rules, but we need a much more sophisticated regulatory framework for big tech companies. I suggest strict rules governing advertising: we should be able to see who has paid for an ad and how it is targeted. We should also have easy ways of seeing if we are dealing with real people online, and clear signposts about the authenticity of websites.</p><p>An even bigger problem is deterring the conscious wrongdoers: criminals, hooligans and hostile states. One simple step would be to increase the banks' liability for cybercrime. The latest wave of scams targeting TSB customers works because that ill-run bank's computer systems are not working properly, because its systems do not spot suspicious transactions, and because other banks allow criminals with phoney IDs to open accounts to receive the loot. It also takes a scandalously long time for victims to reach the fraud department, by which time the money is gone. Better security would cost the banks money, but save customers much grief.</p><p>Jeremy Wright, QC, the attorneygeneral, highlighted the risks we face from hostile states in a speech this week, urging stricter application of international law to cyberspace. Yet oddly he found no time to mention the GDPR, which is the best example yet of how international co-operation can raise standards and bring big companies to heel. Perhaps the idea that the EU might do something right is too dangerous for a minister to endorse.</p><p>We need protection from the arrogance of firms like Facebook</p><p>Have one email for messages that matter and another for spam</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-137914640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD9-0TJ1-DY9P-N47X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000858K</classCode><className>DAY COS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS321211 HARDWOOD VENEER &amp;

That is thanks to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an excellent, belated and sweeping reform. Its provisions, had they only been in force earlier, would have done much to hamper the crooks, snoopers and spivs who have rampaged through the internet's flimsy security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My inbox (and probably yours) gives evidence of the scope for improvement. Messages, panicky and plaintive, are flooding in from companies I have never heard of, begging to be allowed to continue sending emails that I never read.</p><p>That highlights one part of the problem: we have been wildly promiscuous with our personal data. We hand out our email addresses and mobile phone numbers far more readily than we would share our home addresses, though in the wrong hands these electronic co-ordinates can do us a lot more damage than the real-world ones.</p><p>If I have your home address, my options are limited. I can send you junk mail, look through your windows, and in extremis burgle your house.</p><p>In the electronic world, the costs and risks are much lower and the gain greater. Emails and text messages, unlike junk postal letters, cost almost nothing to send and can do real damage, with links and attachments containing malware.</p><p>Click in the wrong place and your computer is infected, meaning a malefactor can steal your money, abuse your privacy, or target your friends. Readers might wish to consider following my approach, of having one email address for sending and receiving messages that actually matter, and another, rather like a PO Box, that can be given out to all and sundry. Treat everything that comes into the public one with scepticism.</p><p>Under GDPR, storing personal data for no reason is illegal. But the swarm of emails highlights another kind of ignorance, among companies, not consumers. Many are unnecessary: the new rules certainly do not prohibit businesses from contacting previous or current customers. For most people sending out emails, the main thing is just to ensure that recipients can unsubscribe easily - for example by having a no-fuss link to click at the bottom of the message. Some of the emails asking for my consent are probably themselves illegal. Amusingly, a few are from law firms touting their expertise on GDPR.</p><p>Where the new rules really bite is on big companies that are careless or secretive. TalkTalk, for example, would have been in even more trouble about its data breach in 2015, which allowed criminals to scam its customers. True, its share price is now down by two thirds, and it paid a record \u00a3400,000 penalty. But under GDPR it could face a fine of up to 4 per cent of its turnover, or about \u00a370 million. The same fines apply to custodians of our data who fail to report breaches of their networks. They have to report them within 72 hours. We also gain an important right to ask companies for all the data that they hold about us.</p><p>Prosecutions and court rulings will flesh out the details (lawyers are salivating) but already the GDPR framework is becoming a global standard. In effect, if you want to do business with anyone in the European Union, it applies to you. It makes America's state of cyberfeudalism, in which the rich and powerful call the shots over the digital serfs, look even more anachronistic. Wisely, Britain will stay in the GDPR framework after Brexit.</p><p>But protection of personal data is just part of a much wider set of difficulties. One is the arrogance and irresponsibility of big tech companies such as Facebook. Its naive vision of an interconnected world has unleashed the furies in places like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, where an unfounded allegation shared on social media can whip a mob into a lethal frenzy. Facebook's blithe disregard of the rules on political advertising has probably enabled Russians and others to manipulate elections here and in the US.</p><p>GDPR lays down some basic rules, but we need a much more sophisticated regulatory framework for big tech companies. I suggest strict rules governing advertising: we should be able to see who has paid for an ad and how it is targeted. We should also have easy ways of seeing if we are dealing with real people online, and clear signposts about the authenticity of websites.</p><p>An even bigger problem is deterring the conscious wrongdoers: criminals, hooligans and hostile states. One simple step would be to increase the banks' liability for cybercrime. The latest wave of scams targeting TSB customers works because that ill-run bank's computer systems are not working properly, because its systems do not spot suspicious transactions, and because other banks allow criminals with phoney IDs to open accounts to receive the loot. It also takes a scandalously long time for victims to reach the fraud department, by which time the money is gone. Better security would cost the banks money, but save customers much grief.</p><p>Jeremy Wright, QC, the attorneygeneral, highlighted the risks we face from hostile states in a speech this week, urging stricter application of international law to cyberspace. Yet oddly he found no time to mention the GDPR, which is the best example yet of how international co-operation can raise standards and bring big companies to heel. Perhaps the idea that the EU might do something right is too dangerous for a minister to endorse.</p><p>Have one email for messages that matter and another for spam</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-137916883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD9-0TJ1-DY9P-N3H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000858K</classCode><className>DAY COS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS321211 HARDWOOD VENEER &amp;

Ideally there would be no gap between these, but in practice it almost can't be helped.<br/>To take one dumb example, the embryonic audio social network Clubhouse posted its first set of community guidelines the other week. One of these rules says \"we prohibit the spread of or attempts to spread false information or news.\" In theory, this means that only the truth is allowed on Clubhouse. Not a bad policy, really, but when you're building a network that someday anyone will be able to use to essentially broadcast their phone calls, I imagine that Clubhouse will find it extremely hard to enforce. Of course people will lie on Clubhouse. They will lie all the time. The question is who will be punished for doing so.</p><p><br/>I thought about all this on Tuesday night after reading that Twitter had banned 7,000 accounts and put restrictions on 150,000 more related to the sprawling conspiracy theory slash alternate reality game slash religion QAnon. Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny had the scoop at NBC News:<br/>Twitter will stop recommending accounts and content related to QAnon, including material in email and follow recommendations, and it will take steps to limit circulation of content in features like trends and search. The action will affect about 150,000 accounts, said a spokesperson, who asked to remain unnamed because of concerns about the targeted harassment of social media employees.<br/>The sweeping enforcement action will ban QAnon-related terms from appearing in trending topics and the platform's search feature, ban known QAnon-related URLs and prohibit \"swarming\" of people who are baselessly targeted by coordinated harassment campaigns pushed by QAnon followers.<br/>The ban on \"swarming\" is particularly significant. Often conspiracy theorists will falsely declare various celebrities and politicians as being at the heart of some lunatic Satan-worshiping scheme, and their followers will descend on the timelines of the accused - and their friends and family - to wreak havoc.<br/>And yet, how will swarming be detected? Twitter updated its policy by tweeting it, which means the update itself was brief to the point of being opaque. You will be suspending if you are found to be \"coordinating abuse around individual victims.\" OK. But what if you're just one of thousands of accounts in the victim's mentions tweeting \"stop eating babies\"? I don't see anything in the policy about that - perhaps because, from an enforcement, perspective, it could be difficult to determine what makes abuse \"coordinated.\" As Evelyn Douek notes here, Twitter itself has not yet defined what it means by coordination.<br/>In any case, it seems that Twitter won't be the only network to take a harder stance against QAnon. Facebook plans to escalate its own enforcement against its adherents, Kate Conger reports at the New York Times. She also offers a good concise description of what QAnon is, for those still unaware:<br/>Facebook is preparing to take similar steps to limit the reach of QAnon content on its platform, said two Facebook employees with knowledge of the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The company has been coordinating with Twitter and other social media companies and plans to make and announcement next month, the employees said. Facebook declined to comment.<br/>The QAnon theories stem from an anonymous person or group of people who use the name \"Q\" and claim to have access to government secrets that reveal a plot against President Trump and his supporters. That supposedly classified information was initially posted on message boards before spreading to mainstream internet platforms and has led to significant online harassment as well as physical violence.<br/>All of this is welcome news, since QAnon conspiracists have increasingly been associated with real-world violence. (Pizzagate, a forerunner of QAnon, famously led to a gunman shooting up a pizza restaurant.)<br/>At the same time, QAnon is also a political movement. By some counts, there are a dozen Republicans now running for national office who profess allegiance to QAnon. Some are expected to win seats in Congress. And so will they be affected by the ban?<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"A Twitter spox tells me that 'currently candidates and elected officials will not be automatically included in many of these actions broadly,'\" CNN's Oliver Darcy reported. That suggests that some of these QAnon adherents who win Congressional seats could continue to use Twitter to promote the idea that there is a \"deep state\" devoted to child murder, potentially inciting their followers to violence. It's an admittedly difficult position for Twitter (or Facebook) to be in - the bar for de-platforming an elected official should be high. And yet it's hard to imagine that members of the QAnon caucus won't clear it.<br/>It's easy to announce some strict new policy against some violent group and get some praise. But we've seen enough of these adjustments recently - I'm thinking here of Facebook's Boogaloo ban - to know that the devil is very much in the details. I believe Twitter intends to eliminate as much QAnon content from the platform as it can. But I'm less sure, looking at its flimsy tweets on the subject, how it will.<br/>PushbackI.<br/>On Tuesday I wrote about the New York Times' Kevin Roose and his tweets about the most popular links on Facebook, which have aggravated company executives by painting what they say is a misleading picture of the News Feed. I got an unusually polarized response, and wanted to share it here. The pro-Roose side, which you can get a flavor of in the responses to CNN reporter Oliver Darcy's tweet about my story, is about what you would expect: Facebook bad, go Kevin.<br/>Meanwhile, people in Facebook's orbit criticized me for going too easy on Roose's tweets. The data he's using comes from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing the spread of stories on social networks. But what it measures is activity on Facebook publisher pages, not links shared throughout the ecosystem overall. And the people who interact heavily with Facebook publisher pages are not typical Facebook users - they're more partisan than average, and that distorts the picture painted in the lists, people told me. But because that picture fits reporters' general view of Facebook, which is that it is is a powerful engine for promoting the conservative movement and its leading figures, we've all accepted the idea that CrowdTangle data is a good gauge of what's popular on Facebook.<br/>I don't know. Open CrowdTangle. \"The easiest way to keep track of what's happening on social media,\" a banner blares. Log in, and a prominent tab called \"Leaderboard\" links you to a list of publishing categories that you can sort by interactions or views. There is not a disclaimer when you log in that says, \"just so you know, CrowdTangle data paints a misleading picture of what's really happening on Facebook.\" Instead it offers a bunch of data in attractive charts about content that very much appears to be popular. Hence the leaderboard!<br/>Anyway, if Facebook wants to do something about the way reporters like Roose represent data on a tool that Facebook itself owns, it seems to me that they could start with the tool rather than the tweets.<br/>II.<br/>Last month I wrote about how the independent developer Basecamp successfully bent Apple's App Store policies after complaining about the company's anticompetitive practices surrounding its own email app and certain revenue it hoped to extract from Basecamp's email app Hey. Now an antitrust hearing has been scheduled on Monday in the House of Representatives, where Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to testify and take questions on App Store competition.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Ahead of that, today Apple held a briefing to announce that it had commissioned a study of the commissions taken by various other e-commerce players. Economists at something called the Analysis Group were called in to look up the various cuts taken by Google, Airbnb, and other platforms, and they did, and on Wednesday they published a PDF. They were neither asked nor allowed to comment on the significance of the findings or the fairness of the App Store.<br/>Anyway, OneZero's Will Oremus had my thoughts exactly when he said: \"I wrote in depth about the antitrust case against Apple in February. The core argument was never that the 30% rate was out of line with the industry. It's that developers had no choice but to pay it, even while competing with Apple's own apps that do not.\"<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending up: Facebook is creating new teams at Facebook and Instagram to study racial bias in its products. The \"equity and inclusion team\" at Instagram will examine how Black and Hispanic users in the US are affected by the company's algorithms. (Deepa Seetharaman and Jeff Horwitz / The Wall Street Journal)<br/>Governing\u2b50 Slack filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, accusing the tech giant of using its market power to try to crush competition. Unlike the other big tech companies, Microsoft has escaped antitrust scrutiny so far. New York Times reporter Steve Lohr has the details of the complaint:<br/>Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. That bundling tactic, Slack contends, is part of a pattern of anticompetitive behavior by Microsoft.<br/>\"Slack threatens Microsoft's hold on business email, the cornerstone of Office, which means Slack threatens Microsoft's lock on enterprise software,\" Jonathan Prince, vice president of communications and policy at Slack, said in a statement.<br/>Republicans are calling on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify at the upcoming antitrust hearing alongside the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. In a letter to Democratic leadership, Jim Jordan, (R-OH), wrote: \"We believe there is bipartisan interest to hear from Twitter about its power in the marketplace, its role in moderating content on its platform, and the causes for its recent highly publicized security breaches.\" (Lauren Feiner / CNBC)<br/>Italy's antitrust authority raided the offices of Apple and Amazon after a local retailer complained they'd been banned from re-selling products on the online marketplace. The companies are suspected of unfairly curbing the sale of Apple's Beats products by anyone other than members of its official reseller program.

John Thune (R-S.D.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). The bill is an attempt to curb Section 230 protections for big tech companies. (Ashley Gold / Axios)<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bangladesh's regulator ordered telecom operators to stop providing free access to social media companies. Over the last 10 years, companies like Facebook and Twitter have struck partnerships, known as zero-rating deals, with telecom operators to make their services free to users to accelerate growth. (Manish Singh / TechCrunch)<br/>Ellen Pao, who briefly led Reddit and was the subject of a series of targeted harassment campaigns, has some suggestions for how Facebook can deal with hate on its platform. First up? Stop outsourcing content moderation and make moderators employees. (Julia Carrie Wong / The Guardian)<br/>The three brothers behind MeidasTouch - a media company turned super PAC - are successfully spinning up viral content for social networks by using Trump's own words against him. Recent videos targeting Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump have more than 14 million views combined on Twitter. (Gregory Krieg and Ryan Nobles / CNN)<br/>Inside China's global propaganda apparatus. The Chinese Communist Party uses both broadcast and social media to try and shape the narrative, including leveraging influencers with millions of followers to spread messages on social platforms. So far, it has been less effective than Russia. (Stanford Internet Observatory)<br/>Industry\u2b50 A group of US investors in ByteDance is considering buying control of TikTok as a way of dealing with a possible US ban of the app. Juro Osawa and Tom Dotan at The Information have the story:<br/>Under the idea being discussed, a group of existing ByteDance shareholders, possibly including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic, SoftBank and New Enterprise Associates, would collectively buy the majority stake, said people familiar with the idea. ByteDance may continue to own a minority stake, although probably without board representation. The investors' hope would be to take TikTok public at some point in the future so they could eventually sell their stake, the people said.<br/>Several issues remain unresolved, and it isn't clear if all investors are behind the idea or whether it is being driven by a handful of them. One question is whether the government would allow ByteDance to continue owning even a minority stake. Another is whether the investors would buy all of TikTok, just the U.S. operations, or the U.S. and India operations together. TikTok has already been banned in India, its biggest market by users, due to tensions between the Chinese and Indian governments.<br/>Snap had a strong second quarter despite the ongoing pandemic. The company's user base is up by 9 million people daily over last quarter, and its revenue is up 17 percent year over year, at $454 million. (Ashley Carman / The Verge)<br/>Snap launched an internal investigation into allegations of racism and sexism at the company. The move comes after former employees spoke out in June about a lack of diversity at the company, and what they called biased editorial practices.<br/>Facebook is adding an extra layer of security to Messenger. Now, the app can be locked on or shortly after closing, and require Face ID or Touch ID to open back up. (Jacob Kastrenakes / The Verge)<br/>\u00a0<br/>WhatsApp is piloting a project to offer credit, insurance and pension products to low-income people in India. The move is part of Facebook's push to get into the digital payments space in India. (Manish Singh / TechCrunch)<br/>Joe Rogan and Wall Street Journal writer Abigail Shrier equated being transgender to having anorexia, joining a cult, and \"demonic possession\" in a recent episode of Rogan's show uploaded to YouTube. Rogan is one of the most influential podcast hosts in the world, and his podcast was just acquired by Spotify. Does Spotify even have a policy team? Does it have community guidelines? Expect a lot more reporting like this in coming months. (Alex Paterson / Media Matters)<br/>Thorn, a nonprofit that builds tools to fight child sexual exploitation, launched a tool on to help small- and medium-size tech companies find, remove and report child sexual abuse material. The tool, called Safer, is designed for companies that don't have the resources to build their own systems. Every company that lets users upload media to its servers needs to employ tech like Thorn has built here. (Olivia Solon / NBC)<br/>Things to doStuff to occupy you online during the quarantine.<br/>Endlessly doomscroll. \"Doomscrolling\" refers to the behavior of helplessly thumbing through social media feeds for fear of missing some even more catastrophic news than the events you already know about. Ben Grosser's latest social media art project invites you to scroll through an infinite series of disturbing partial headlines: \"Outbreak Grows,\" \"Curve Rising Too Quickly,\" \"Experts Say Future Uncertain.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1248194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-0K31-JBYT-H0B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Reflecting local topography, there's Silicon Glen, Silicon Fen, Silicon Roundabout, Silicon Steppe and, most egregiously, Philicon Valley take a bow Philadelphia, among other wannabes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there's only one Silicon Valley. How to explain the sui generis success of this \"high-tech Galapagos?\" Margaret O'Mara's \"The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America\" sets out to crack the elusive code behind the code that has supplanted fruit as the valley's main export. The result is a fresh, provocative take that upends the self-serving mythologizing of the valley's own.</p><p>Conventional wisdom depicts the valley as a place apart, remote from and unbeholden to old power centers, the product of rugged individualism, its history a pageant of eureka moments in garages and dorm rooms. In this telling, government figures barely - as a scold or spoiler to be kept at bay - if at all.</p><p>A historian who worked in the Clinton administration before entering academia, O'Mara posits a counter-narrative in which the valley owes its origins - and survival during lean times - to defense contracts, and government emerges as \"perhaps its greatest . venture capitalist.\" Whirring away in the background like electrical current through computer circuitry: a nexus of money, power and influence between the valley and Washington that predates Al Gore's internet boosterism, Obama officials' coziness with big tech or Google's high-powered D.C. lobbying operation.</p><p>But O'Mara is hardly proposing the valley as a creature of big government-by-stealth or enlightened bureaucratic design. Rather, the workings of government there have often been indirect, sometimes inadvertent, she writes, as much rooted in omission as commission - dwelling in the negative space of inaction and permissive regulation besides \"largesse\" and purposeful programs. Either way, a constant has been intensive politicking by valley brass - for all their professed libertarianism or apolitical leanings, far from passive recipients of grace and favor. It's a frame that casts familiar figures in a new light. Storied venture capitalist John Doerr provided seed capital to Amazon, Google, Sun and Netscape but, an emissary to Washington's elite, arch coalition builder and lobbyist in chief for the industry, he was also a consummate \"policy entrepreneur,\" O'Mara points out.</p><p>\"The Code\" doesn't skimp on the milestones of valley lore - the \"traitorous eight\" splitting from Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor and modern-day Silicon Valley; or, \"the mother of all demos\" showcasing \"the mouse, interactive computing, hyperlinks, networked video and audio\" in 1968. But O'Mara spotlights the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">village</emphasis> of institutions, networks and ancillary services - corps of bankers, lawyers and marketers overlooked in many accounts of the valley's exceptionalism - behind the big moments.</p><p>She also supplements them with a concatenation of ostensibly small deeds, obscure statutes, legislative arcana and legal loopholes that proved deeply consequential.</p><p>Consider an alternative valley timeline beginning with the 1958 Small Business Investment Act: in its generous matching loans for startup investors a catalyst for the first wave of VC firms.</p><p>And in 1994, when merchants eyed the nascent web as a medium of commercial exchange but consumers balked at entrusting their credit card to websites, enter the government with a means of protecting this data that laid down the rudiments of secure online transactions and helped jump-start e-commerce - perhaps \"the greatest return on investment in Valley history.\"</p><p>Meantime, we're still living with the reverberations of fine print in the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Industry lobbying, and the efforts of civil liberties advocates, purged it of sanctions against online porn peddlers but not a clause absolving platforms of responsibility for content posted to their sites.</p><p>Overall, the Clinton administration ensured the infant web wasn't captured by big business, but also that it wasn't smothered by regulation.</p><p>Then there's the outsize impact - for better and worse - of California's proscription of non-compete job contracts, allowing workers to decamp with impunity to rival firms. This has fostered a certain industry-wide collegiality, not to mention a fluid job market. And it's led to referral-based recruitment that's proved expedient in tapping an industry-wide pool in which new hires are readily attuned to a prevailing culture and, interchangeable as widgets, quickly productive. But it's also contributed toward a hermetic culture - self-propagating, incestuous and insular - in which recruitment has too often been confined to \"charmed circles\" of white, maybe Asian men, O'Mara writes. The result: \"programmed in sharp gender and racial imbalances\" - the valley's historical blind spots, all the more glaring for their coexistence with its often otherwise progressive mores.</p><p>Such happenstances lack the sexiness of hackathons and product launches, but they've been formative in the valley's culture and products. And they're of more than academic interest as the pervasiveness of the valley's cultural currency and products makes its pathologies, besides its ingenuities, the concern of us all.</p><p>Ironically, at a time when this influence is maximally felt, the valley is on its way to physically obsoleting itself, O'Mara adds. The cloud liberates entrepreneurs from place, permitting them to rent computing power and tap remote teams rather than investing in pricey hardware and on-site teams. And how many scrappy founders can afford to bootstrap a company in today's valley? The obituaries are already being written. But the valley's been written off before.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>By Margaret O'Mara</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Penguin Press</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>512 pages;

The rules will for the first time require health providers to send medical information to third-party apps, like Apple\u2019s Health Records, after a patient has authorized the data exchange. The regulations, proposed this year by the Department of Health and Human Services, are intended to make it easier for people to see their medical records, manage their illnesses and understand their treatment choices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet groups including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">American Medical Association</url> and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</url> warned regulators in May that people who authorized consumer apps to retrieve their medical records could open themselves up to serious data abuses. Federal privacy protections, which limit how health providers and insurers may use and share medical records, no longer apply once patients transfer their data to consumer apps.</p><p>The American Medical Association, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">American Hospital Association</url> and other groups said they had recently met with health regulators to push for changes to the rules. Without federal restrictions in place, the groups argued, consumer apps would be free to share or sell sensitive details like a patient\u2019s prescription drug history. And some warned that the spread of such personal medical information could lead to higher insurance rates or job discrimination.</p><p>\u201cPatients simply may not realize that their genetic, reproductive health, substance abuse disorder, mental health information can be used in ways that could ultimately limit their access to health insurance, life insurance or even be disclosed to their employers,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Dr. Jesse M. Ehrenfeld</url>, an anesthesiologist who is the chair of the American Medical Association\u2019s board. \u201cPatient privacy can\u2019t be retrieved once it\u2019s lost.\u201d<br/></p><p>Enabling people to use third-party consumer apps to easily retrieve their medical data would be a milestone in patient rights.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Dr. Don Rucker</url>, the federal health department\u2019s national coordinator for health information technology, said that allowing people convenient access to their medical data would help them better manage their health, seek second opinions and understand medical costs. He said the idea was to treat medicine as a consumer service, so people can shop for doctors and insurers on their smartphones as easily as they pay bills, check bus schedules or buy plane tickets.</p><p>\u201cThis is major, major, major,\u201d he said. \u201cThe provision of health care will be brought into the app economy and, through that, to a much, much higher degree of patient control.\u201d</p><p>The new rules are emerging just as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Amazon</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Apple</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Google</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Microsoft</url> are racing to capitalize on health data and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">capture a bigger slice</url> of the health care market. Opening the floodgates on patient records now, Dr. Rucker said, could help tech giants and small app makers alike develop novel consumer health products.</p><p>The regulations are part of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">government effort to push health providers</url> to use and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">share electronic health records</url>. Regulators have long hoped that centralizing medical data online would let doctors get a fuller, more accurate picture of patient health and help people make more informed medical choices, with the promise of better health outcomes.</p><p>In reality, digital health records have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">been cumbersome for many physicians</url> to use and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">difficult</url> for many patients to retrieve.</p><p>Americans have had the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">right to obtain copies of their medical records since 2000</url> under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. But many health providers still send medical records by fax or require patients to pick up paper or DVD copies of their files.</p><p>The new regulations are intended to banish such bureaucratic hurdles.</p><p>Dr. Rucker said it was self-serving for physicians and hospitals, which may benefit financially from keeping patients and their data captive, to play up privacy concerns.</p><p>\u201cAll we\u2019re saying is that patients have a right to choose as opposed to the right being denied them by the forces of paternalism,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services proposed two new data-sharing rules this year to carry out provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act, a 2016 law designed to speed medical innovation.</p><p>Dr. Rucker\u2019s office <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">developed the one</url> that would allow patients to send their electronic medical information, including treatment pricing, directly to apps from their health providers. It will require vendors of electronic health records to adopt software known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s. Once the software is in place, Dr. Rucker said, patients will be able to use smartphone apps \u201cin an Uber-like fashion\u201d to get their medical data.</p><p>To foster such data-sharing, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">coalition of tech giants</url> \u2014 including Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 has committed to using       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">common standards</url> to categorize and format health information. Microsoft, for instance, has developed cloud services to help health providers, insurers and health record vendors make data available to patients.</p><p>\u201cWhat that lets an individual consumer do is to connect an app or service of their own choice into their health care records and pull down data about their historical lab tests, about their medical problems or condition, about medication prescription,\u201d said Josh Mandel, chief architect for Microsoft Healthcare.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">The other proposed rule</url>, developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would require Medicare and Medicaid plans, and plans participating in the federal health insurance marketplace, to adopt A.P.I.s so people could use third-party apps to get their insurance claims and benefit information. <br/></p><p>The regulations are expected to become final this year. Health providers and health record vendors will have two years to comply with the A.P.I. requirements. Electronic health record vendors that impede data-sharing \u2014 a practice called \u201cinformation blocking\u201d \u2014 could be fined up to $1 million per violation. Doctors accused of information blocking could be subject to federal investigation.</p><p>Brett Meeks, vice president of policy and legal for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Center for Medical Interoperability</url>, a nonprofit that works to advance data sharing among health care technologies, said it would be better for regulators to help foster a trustworthy data-sharing platform before requiring doctors to entrust patients\u2019 medical records to consumer tech platforms.</p><p>\u201cFacebook, Google and others are currently under scrutiny for being poor stewards of consumer data,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you carte blanche hand them your health data on top of it so they could do whatever they want with it?\u201d</p><p>Physicians\u2019 organizations and others said the rules failed to give people granular control over their data. They added that the regulations could require them to share patients\u2019 sensitive medical or financial information with apps and insurers against their better judgment.<br/></p><p>The current protocols for exchanging patients\u2019 data, for instance, would let people use consumer apps to get different types of information, like their prescription drug history. But it is an all-or-nothing choice. People who authorized an app to collect their medication lists would not be able to stop it from retrieving specific data \u2014 like the names of H.I.V. or cancer drugs \u2014 they might prefer to keep private.</p><p>Dr. Rucker said that current information-sharing standards could not accommodate granular data controls and that privacy concerns needed to be balanced against the benefits of improved patient access to their medical information.</p><p>In any case, he said, many people are comfortable liberally sharing personal health details \u2014 enabling, say, fitness apps to collect their heart rate data \u2014 that are not covered by federal protections. Patients, he said, have the right to make similar choices about which apps to entrust with their medical data.</p><p>\u201cA lot of this actually will be enforced by people picking apps they trust from brand names they trust in exactly the same way that people don\u2019t let their banking data and their financial data just go out randomly,\u201d he said.</p><p>Apple\u2019s Health Records app, for instance, lets people send a subset of their medical data directly to their iPhones from more than 300 health care centers. Apple said it did not have access to that information because it was encrypted and stored locally on people\u2019s personal devices.</p><p>But even proponents of the new regulations are calling for basic privacy and security rules for tech platforms that collect and use people\u2019s medical information.</p><p>\u201cThe moment our data goes into a consumer health tech solution, we have no rights,\u201d said<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HHS-ONC-2019-0002-1914\">Andrea Downing, a data rights advocate</url> for people with hereditary cancers. \u201cWithout meaningful protections or transparency on how data is shared, it could be used by a recruiter to deny us jobs,\u201d or by an insurer to deny coverage.</p><p>Natasha Singer covers privacy for The Times.

As the youngest candidate, he aims to kickstart a fresh, young era of politics. A central part of his campaign is reforming the Supreme Court to 15 justices, with five Democrats, five Republicans and five apolitical judges comprising the seats. One of the many Deomcratic candidates to support capitalism, Buttigieg's economic platform aims to reinforce strong relations with labor unions and separate money from politics. On immigration, he supports DACA and the rights of Dreamers, opposes Trump's harsh deportation policies and considers sending troops to the border a waste of time. As former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to Jan. 1, 2020, Buttigieg had a complex relationship with police and the black community in the city. After controversially firing South Bend's first black police chief and refusing to release the recorded phone calls at the center of the debacle, the incident has been used as a criticism of his campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supporter demographic: Buttigieg's primary support comes from white, college-educated men and women, typically middle-aged and older.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more information on Buttigieg's policies, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.peteforamerica.com/issues\">www.peteforamerica.com/issues</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sen.

Sanders has won the popular vote in the first three primary contests so far and has emerged nationally as the front-runner in the race, consistently ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. The key policies that Sanders is running on are Medicare-for-All, The Green New Deal and tuition-free public college. These policies have all had wide-spread support among democratic voters and slim majorities of voters overall.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Supporter demographic: Bernie has the most support, with The Economist citing him as being supported by 29% of the population. Demographic groups with the highest percentage of support for Bernie are voters under the age of 30, hispanic voters with and without a college education and voters who don't identify racially as white, black or hispanic.\u00a0</p><p>For more information on Sanders' policies, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.berniesanders.com/issues\">www.berniesanders.com/issues</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sen.

As the youngest candidate, he aims to kickstart a fresh, young era of politics. A central part of his campaign is reforming the Supreme Court to 15 justices, with five Democrats, five Republicans and five apolitical judges comprising the seats. One of the many Deomcratic candidates to support capitalism, Buttigieg's economic platform aims to reinforce strong relations with labor unions and separate money from politics. On immigration, he supports DACA and the rights of Dreamers, opposes Trump's harsh deportation policies and considers sending troops to the border a waste of time. As former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to Jan. 1, 2020, Buttigieg had a complex relationship with police and the black community in the city. After controversially firing South Bend's first black police chief and refusing to release the recorded phone calls at the center of the debacle, the incident has been used as a criticism of his campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supporter demographic: Buttigieg's primary support comes from white, college-educated men and women, typically middle-aged and older.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more information on Buttigieg's policies, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.peteforamerica.com/issues\">www.peteforamerica.com/issues</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sen.

Sanders has won the popular vote in the first three primary contests so far and has emerged nationally as the front-runner in the race, consistently ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. The key policies that Sanders is running on are Medicare-for-All, The Green New Deal and tuition-free public college. These policies have all had wide-spread support among democratic voters and slim majorities of voters overall.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Supporter demographic: Bernie has the most support, with The Economist citing him as being supported by 29% of the population.

If utility enforcers had done a better job of getting trains to run on time, fix water leaks and come down heavily on rigged standard tariff energy prices then Labour's public ownership plans might have attracted more opprobrium.</p><p>But one regulator which has figured out that consumer interest and national interest are one and the same, is the Competition and Markets Authority.</p><p>The CMA's holiday season intervention against Amazon's effort to gain a foothold in the UK's restaurant delivery market by making a \u00a3442m investment in Deliveroo is a significant moment.</p><p>It reinforces the CMA's robust approach to making sure that, when it comes to food, citizens have choice and the best prices.</p><p>Critically, the CMA is not prepared to give Silicon Valley giants the benefit of the doubt. It is terrific that Amazon, Google and Apple regard the UK as a great place to invest and create high-tech jobs. But Britain also needs to know they will be good corporate citizens.</p><p>The main complaint is that big-tech fails to pay its fair share of taxes on vast UK turnovers. Our biggest grocers have been outspoken critics of how those who undercut the High Street pay pitiful amounts of business rates because of operations run from out-of-town warehouses. There is a bigger threat. The digital giants - which were the biggest movers on the US markets last year, advancing 40pc with a combined valuation of $5 trillion - are natural monopolists which seek to wipe out competition. Amazon's impact on the book trade is well documented. And Facebook, with its 2.45bn users, should never have been permitted to dominate social media by owning both WhatsApp and Instagram, giving it a stranglehold on digital advertising.</p><p>WHEN it comes to food, the CMA demonstrated in April 2019, when it blocked the merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, how it values the consumer and supplier interest above all else.</p><p>There is no substitute for good, focused management. Tesco (Chinese Christmas cards notwithstanding) demonstrated that it is possible to give consumers a good deal and treat suppliers fairly.</p><p>The Co-op has made a comeback by focusing on community services and produce.</p><p>And Aldi and Lidl are gaining market share by offering value across a narrow range.</p><p>There is no reason why Sainsbury's - with its Argos subsidiary - and Asda - with Walmart-scale ownership - should not do well as standalones.</p><p>Britain is a digital leader when it comes to the algorithms and logistics powering food services Deliveroo and Just Eat. That is why Amazon wants backdoor control over Deliveroo, and Just Eat finds itself facing two competing \u00a34.9bn takeovers from Dutch rival <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Takeaway.com\">www.Takeaway.com</url> and South African-controlled Naspers.</p><p>This paper has favoured the Dutch offer for Just Eat partly because of the pledge to keep a London quotation. It would be far preferable were Just Eat the buyer, giving the UK the chance to build something global off its own bat.</p><p>Now that the CMA has intervened against Amazon, the competition regulator should also probe what a Just Eat takeover would mean for consumers, suppliers, UK technology and the public interest.</p><p>Deals involving food prices and services should never go through on the nod.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-156090129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVV-91V1-JCBW-N0D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

If utility enforcers had done a better job of getting trains to run on time, fix water leaks and come down heavily on rigged standard tariff energy prices then Labour's public ownership plans might have attracted more opprobrium.</p><p>But one regulator which has figured out that consumer interest and national interest are one and the same, is the Competition and Markets Authority.</p><p>The CMA's holiday season intervention against Amazon's effort to gain a foothold in the UK's restaurant delivery market by making a \u00a3442m investment in Deliveroo is a significant moment.</p><p>It reinforces the CMA's robust approach to making sure that, when it comes to food, citizens have choice and the best prices.</p><p>Critically, the CMA is not prepared to give Silicon Valley giants the benefit of the doubt. It is terrific that Amazon, Google and Apple regard the UK as a great place to invest and create high-tech jobs. But Britain also needs to know they will be good corporate citizens.</p><p>The main complaint is that big-tech fails to pay its fair share of taxes on vast UK turnovers. Our biggest grocers have been outspoken critics of how those who undercut the High Street pay pitiful amounts of business rates because of operations run from out-of-town warehouses. There is a bigger threat. The digital giants - which were the biggest movers on the US markets last year, advancing 40pc with a combined valuation of $5 trillion - are natural monopolists which seek to wipe out competition.</p><p>Amazon's impact on the book trade is well documented. And Facebook, with its 2.45bn users, should never have been permitted to dominate social media by owning both WhatsApp and Instagram, giving it a stranglehold on digital advertising.</p><p>When it comes to food, the CMA demonstrated in April 2019, when it blocked the merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, how it values the consumer and supplier interest above all else.</p><p>There is no substitute for good, focused management. Tesco (Chinese Christmas cards notwithstanding) demonstrated that it is possible to give consumers a good deal and treat suppliers fairly.</p><p>The Co-op has made a comeback by focusing on community services and produce. And Aldi and Lidl are gaining market share by offering value across a narrow range.</p><p>There is no reason why Sainsbury's - with its Argos subsidiary - and Asda - with Walmart-scale ownership - should not do well as standalones.</p><p>Britain is a digital leader when it comes to the algorithms and logistics powering food services Deliveroo and Just Eat. That is why Amazon wants backdoor control over Deliveroo, and Just Eat finds itself facing two competing \u00a34.9bn takeovers from Dutch rival Takeaway.com and South African-controlled Naspers.</p><p>This paper has favoured the Dutch offer for Just Eat partly because of the pledge to keep a London quotation. It would be far preferable were Just Eat the buyer, giving the UK the chance to build something global off its own bat.</p><p>Now that the CMA has intervened against Amazon, the competition regulator should also probe what a Just Eat takeover would mean for consumers, suppliers, UK technology and the public interest.</p><p>Deals involving food prices and services should never go through on the nod.</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVT-8MH1-DYTG-42HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Investors are waiting on any news out of the China trade talks.  The president will meet with China's top negotiator at the White House this afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are lower but just by a fraction.  Dow Industrials down four points, S&amp;P down 2-1/4, NASDAQ down 16.  This after the markets were a little changed yesterday as well.  The NASDAQ was the top performer.  It was up two-thirds of one percent, 46 points higher.  The Dow Industrials were up 39 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.  In Europe this morning, the major indices are mostly lower.  The FT-100 is down 38 points, half a percent.</p><p>The CAC Quarante in Paris is down 17.  The DAX is higher, although well off the highs of the morning.  We did have had weaker-than-expected factory orders data out, and the GDP forecast, for ItalyGermany this morning, were downgraded.  In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, as you can see there: Shanghai was the performer, China up almost one percent.  Startling new details this morning.  The Ethiopian Airlines crash; preliminary results of the investigation blamed Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.</p><p>Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO last night, 10 agents walked into his house and took him away in a car.  We've got full details this morning.  Now, the interrogation has moved to his wife.  They would not leave her alone last night; she could not go to the ladies' room alone.  She said she had to go to the bathroom, an agent left the door open, and waited right there while she was in the bathed.  She wanted to take a shower, a female agent stayed in the shower while she took a shower.</p><p>It's pretty extraordinary what's going on.  He is now back behind bars.  And, by the way, an update for you, prosecutors will not tell his lawyers why he was rearrested.  We don't know.  Google's voice assistant is getting some celebrity help.  Find out who's lending their voice.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman; and Republican Strategist Erin Elmore.  Good to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this Ghosn story is just incredible, in my view.  I don't know that it hampered any foreign investment into Japan, but you have to question the judicial system in Japan throwing somebody in jail without having his say or his chance, to explain himself.  Just to be clear, he says he's innocent and that this was a coup, as I've been reporting for a hundred days now, that the people at Nissan teamed up with the Ministers of Industry to take him down so that Renault would not acquire Nissan.  Pretty extraordinary stuff.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  This is the fourth time he's been re-arrested since December, which is very unusual in the Japanese legal system, which also has a 99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, this is all about squeezing Carlos Ghosn so much, so he admits to crimes that he did not do.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, they'll get to make their case but obviously, the Japanese executives did not want this European control of the business.  And you know, we'll see what their case is when they lay it out, but this kind of over the top series of actions, 10 agents, to capture Carlos Ghosn, as if he's some sort of -- you know -- crime -- chieftain, who's going to be fighting with them and they need 10 guys to restrain him.  The bathroom sequence with his wife, you mentioned, it just -- it's a series of things that make you wonder: what is the point here other than to intimidate as opposed to search for justice?  Well, eventually, we'll get to hear his side of the story, he was going to give his side to you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he was.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He wanted to then later have a larger press conference.  This seems to have disrupted that and we've learned with the Japanese legal system, they may be able to keep him in jail quite a while now without being able to talk further to his attorneys -- very different from United States.  I think we're all eager to finally hear his unfiltered account of events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, and just to be clear, I did speak with Carlos Ghosn last week.  And he says that this was a coup, his number two was afraid that he was going to get fired because the company was simply not doing well.  And they had missed expectations, and revenue declines for four straight quarters, and he was getting ready to announce some consolidation.  He said, he was not going to announce an out-and-out merger with Renault, but he was certainly going to make some big changes, and they didn't like that.</p><p>And so, they lured him to Japan, and they he arrested him with the help of the minister of industry in Japan.  I'm hearing now that there is a back-and-forth between prime minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  The prime minister's office did not want him rearrested.  They thought -- he thought that this would be a stain on Japan, but the prosecutor went ahead and did it.  10 agents showing up last night, like I said, right before we were about to do an interview, which leads me to question whether or not her phone is tapped as well.</p><p>We know that he has a government phone, the lawyer gave him the phone to use, while he was in this apartment in Tokyo.  But you know, I had been communicating with her, and her phone must be tapped. So, they showed up right before the interview to shut him down.  They don't want him giving a press conference either; he said he wanted a press conference on April 11th.  They don't want the news out; they don't want to hear his plea for innocence.  So, there you go you go.</p><p>We'll follow that.  Meanwhile, there is trouble for Tesla this morning.  The stock is sliding nearly 10 percent, following weak deliver numbers.  This is coming ahead of Elon Musk's SEC battle.  He's headed to the SEC in court with him today.  The stock is down 10 percent, as you can see.  Kristina Partsinevelos is outside the court house.  She's in downtown New York City.  And Kristina, are you expecting to see Elon Musk today?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  No, it seems like the rumor is that he probably won't show up, but you never know in these types of situations.  The SEC. the Security Exchange Commission will be debating here behind me against Elon Musk.  They're going to be squaring off at 2:00 p.m. time.  They're going to be giving their oral arguments which have already been received by the judge.  And what are they debating?  They are debating whether Elon Musk is in contempt for a tweet, that he sent out on February 19.</p><p>This tweet reads: \"Tesla made zero cars in 2011, but we'll make around 500,000 in 2019.\"  This tweet was later updated.  However, the SEC arguing that Musk infringed on his settlement with the SEC for a previous tweet in August where misled investors that he was going to take the company private.  What we know from that settlement is that he had to pay $20 million; Tesla had to pays $20 million.  He had to step down as chairman for three years, and he had to get his tweets preapproved.  And that's the major debate today.</p><p>Musk, though, his legal team, are saying in his defense, two reasons.  First, one, that his tweet on February 19th was a not material.  All of that information about production rate was already in the earnings report, was already discussed on conference call.  The second point is that all of this infringed on Elon Musk's freedom of speech.  This is going to be debated, Maria, today at 2:00 p.m.  The judge is -- according to legal experts we spoke to, not likely to come to a decision today, but could side with SEC, could side with Elon Musk, or scrap out the settlement altogether and start back at zero.  So, we'll find out around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  All right, Kristina, we'll be watching you all day today, ahead of that.  Kristina Partsinevelos in New York.  Meanwhile, we're going to turn to U.S.-China trade.  President Trump just tweeted moments ago he says this: \"Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the economy is looking very strong, and China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely.  There is little or no inflation and USA optimism is very high.\"  President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House.</p><p>The president is likely to announce as summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later today, according to the Wall Street Journal.  We are expecting that to be either later April or early May.  Joining me right now is the Author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang.  And Gordon, it's always a pleasure to see you.  First, let's talk about the trade deal, what are you expecting in terms of the main tenants of any deal?  Do you think we'll get to a deal between the U.S. and China?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR:  Well, everyone says there will be a deal that they've settled 90 percent of the points.  I'm not so sure that we're going to hear a deal announced in next day or so, you know, but next couple of months.  The question, though, is you know we've had a decades of failed trade agreements with China.  The question is do you remedy that with another deal?  So, we'll see how this goes, but, clearly, you know, this is heading in that direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks like the Chinese are willing to open up its markets, they're opening up the markets to financial services companies in the U.S. among other industries, and they're willing to buy more commodities.  What about the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, that's the real (INAUDIBLE) of the problem.  You know, people say: well, look, we're close to a deal, but they have not yet decided on the enforcement mechanisms that can get China to agree to.  And so, that is really going to be the critical thing.  And if President Trump doesn't agree to tough enforcement mechanisms, then clearly, this is not going to be a good deal for us.  But if there are tough enforcement mechanisms, Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler has a lot of incentive to say \"no,\" because they're building up this narrative of national humiliation in China.  And whenever they start talking about that, that's not a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Huawei.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, announcing it is ending collaborations with, and ZTE over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions.  MIT also said it's reviewing the school's collaborations with China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.  This is really getting dicey around Huawei.  I've spoken with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this.  He's trying to tell the Europeans: Look, you know, if you're going to use Huawei telecom, we're going to not share as much information with you.  This is high stakes on Huawei.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, it certainly is.  You know, and one of the arguments that the United States has been making is that, that the 2017 national intelligence law in China requires Chinese parties to spy on others if China demands it.  And certainly, you know, we've seen Huawei spy on the African Union, they did that for 12 -- for five years.  And so, clearly, there's a strong case there, but, you know, Huawei is really supported by the Chinese Diplomatic Corps.  Beijing has gotten behind this company, and that really should tell us a lot because this is a geopolitical issue for China, not just an economic one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you do think that the president will be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism?  Should the Chinese not keep up their promises, not to steal from United States if there is more stealing of I.P., they snap back more tariffs, or what?  What is the enforcement mechanism to get Beijing to keep the promises?</p><p>CHANG:  They're going to keep some tariffs on, and President Trump has been very clear about that for last month.  So, that looks like going it's to be the case.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.</p><p>CHANG:  And the Chinese have been saying: look, that's unacceptable to them.  Now, I don't know where the middle ground here is -- you know, but clearly, this is where we either have a trade deal or we don't have one.  And I sort of think that, you know, it's up to the president to just sort of increase the tariffs until the Chinese stop stealing our I.P.  Because, really, you know, we've had agreements with China and very detailed agreements with China, and they have just dishonored all them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, like the time they said they were going to buy all those beefs, and then they never bought the beef.  I got to get your take on swine flu outbreak in China.  China is not talking about this at all.  But I was talking to an American businessman last night and he was telling me that China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  And right now, 20 percent of the pigs are diseased with swine flu.  So, they are dying -- 20 percent of the pigs in China means that is a 100 million dead pigs.  What are they going to do with a 100 million dead pigs?  How do you dispose of 100 million dead pigs?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, in previous instances like this, they just dump them in the river.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly!  But they can't dump 100 million dead pigs in the river, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, there's going to be a lot of burning of pigs and the rest of it.  The issue here for the United States is that China has agreed to buy more soybeans, but with fewer pigs, they're not going to need soybeans as much as, you know, had anticipated.  So, this is going to be another one of those difficult issues between China and U.S.  Do they actually buy commodities in the amounts agreed?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Earlier, I spoke with New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew about this very issue.  Watch what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D), NEW JERSEY:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher.  There's no question -- when you're going to have a shortage of meat, and you're going to certainly going have a shortage of pork, and the prices are going up -- number one.  Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God, we have got a good Department of Ags to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the source that I was talking to last night said it's not just pork prices that are going up, it's going to ripple throughout meat.  It will go chicken prices, and meat prices as well, what do you think?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, certainly, because, you know, pork is such an important staple in China.  If you don't have it, you're going to have to eat something else.  And so, this is going to affect prices in Asia, and which means it's going to affect prices here.  It's going to have a knock-on effect, as I mentioned on soybeans and other commodities.  So, this is going to be felt worldwide.  Because I'm actually surprised that it's only 50 percent of the world's pork.  I think that it's actually higher --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's more than 50 percent.</p><p>CHANG:  I thought so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  How come nobody talking about the swine flu?  You don't see this reported anywhere?  I mean, I didn't.</p><p>CHANG:  This -- there was a little bit of reporting about two weeks ago, because the U.S. Department of Agriculture confiscated Chinese pork coming into U.S., which was diseased.  And so, that obviously was important to the A.G. markets here.  But you're right, for the most part, this is a story which no one is really talking about, and it does have effect through both the markets and the trade talks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm glad that we discussed it.  Gordon, it's good to see you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That you so much.  Gordon Chang joining us.  Coming up, startling new developments in the case against Boeing.  The very latest on the Ethiopian Airlines crash investigation, that's next.  And then, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars -- I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last night, and as we were about to start the call, 10 agents walked in, took him away.  More on the story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The 737 Max jet, the crash in Ethiopia last month reportedly had a damaged sensor.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Learning some new things here, Maria.  The angle of an attack sensor on the Boeing 737 Max was reportedly damaged during takeoff, by a foreign object or a bird.  That is according to ABC News right now.  Sources are saying that the sensor then sent false readings to the plane's anti-stall system, as the pilots tried desperately to keep it from pushing the plane nose down.  Meanwhile, the preliminary report on the crash from the Ethiopian government that came out this morning, is taking aim at Boeing, finding that the Ethiopian jet apparently nose-dived before it went down and the flight crew performed, according to this report, all the procedures recommended by Boeing, but still could not control that plane.</p><p>Well, Target raising its minimum wage.  The retailer announcing workers are going to now earn $13.00 an hour.  This starts in June, that is up from $12.00.  The move coming as retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers.  Target employs over 300,000 people right now.</p><p>Well, Google Assistant launching its first celebrity voice today, and here you go, it starts with singer, John legend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LEGEND, SINGER:  Whoa.  I am feeling this new voice.  You can find me on all kinds of devices: phones, Google Home, and if I'm lucky, in your heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER).</p><p>CASONE:  You bet, you John!  The musician is going to give you the weather, maybe sing you happy birthday, tell you a joke.  This voice is only available for a limited time unfortunately.  Google says, there are going to be some more celebrity cameos, thanks to approve voice synthesizing technology.  I would love a little happy birthday from John Legend.  Bring it on!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that, yes!  Which celebrity voice do you guys want on your Google devices?  James, what about you?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I guess I'd go with Sinatra, If I had --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one, good one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I would like Dolly Parton, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I'll go with Dolly.</p><p>ELMORE:  She's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Was I fortunate to meet her in the green room in this building a couple of years ago.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's a doll, huh!</p><p>FREEMAN:  She is just as wonderful, as you always hear about.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good to wake up with a voice like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but when she comes in -- she comes in, I don't care what time of day it is, Dolly Parton is always extremely professional.  And she looks you in the eye.  I think of -- like a lot of people can learn from that.  She's incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's real deal.  And now, she's going to the racetrack.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly, you got to watch Dolly.  I mean, she can dust anybody.  That's been clear with her long career.  But anyway, I'll do like, Gilbert Godfrey.  Remember Geico -- that was not Geico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The duck --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, the duck -- the duck fired him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'd be a good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would take Gilbert Godfrey.  Not just because it'll make you pay attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break, coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO when he was arrested again last night, the full story coming up.  Then, privacy alert; Facebook leaving hundreds of millions of user data exposed on public Amazon servers.  How the company is resolving that problem?  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are quiet this morning pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are waiting on any news out of the U.S.-China trade talks.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter this morning, writing this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade, but they are manageable.\"  He calls the U.S. trade issues China substantial and real.</p><p>Want to talk about, Jamie Dimon's letter and really the issues around China.  He's right, and of course, business wants to get into China, and wants the Chinese to open up its markets so that American businesses can sell to the 1.4 billion people.  That's one of the items on the list.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, and the question is, do they mean it this time?  Because what the messages out of China, the formal statements, the new policies, new laws, they -- they have -- announced within the last few months, are all about solving this problem.  Now, the question is are they going to mean it this time?  Are they actually going to allow U.S. businesses to operate there in a -- fair manner?  And we'll see when this trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's just one of several elements.  You've also got China buying more commodities from the U.S., and of course the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, and the forced transfer of technology, Erin.</p><p>ELMORE:  Jamie Dimon is optimistic about China, but there are true concerns there, not just trade and soybeans.  This is about a lot more.  There are copyright infringement I.P. laws, there are no regulations in terms of business, there are no labor laws, there's no minimum wage.  They don't care about pollution.  So, there's a whole lot of issues going on in China, that are a lot bigger than, I think, people are getting credit for and there are concerns going into China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the president ought to really think about taking off the tariffs if he gets the deal he wants.  Because if you leave the tariffs in place, pending a check of China's behavior in the future, what did we really accomplish here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not getting the deal that he wants because it seems like he is willing to keep some tariffs in place.  I mean, that -- it seems like that's where this is going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is, clearly.  The steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place and you're worried about the state of the U.S. auto industry -- well, you just drove up their costs by billions of dollars, and you're still basically putting a thumb down on our auto industry and our manufactures, and trying to blame somebody else for it.  That's not -- that tariffs probably won't go away anytime soon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which means that this drag on our economy may not be relieved by a deal if there's no relief from the essentially taxes on consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though, the economy seems to be holding up strongly in the face of weakness across the world.  The unemployment numbers will be out tomorrow.  We've got our jobs Friday tomorrow.  Joining us to preview that and talk about, investing today is Federated Investor Senior Equity Strategist, Linda Duessel.  Linda, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for weighing in here.  First, the employment, the jobs number tomorrow; how much is priced into the market, what are you expecting from the jobs' report out tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern?  We're expected to see the unemployment rate hold steady at 3.8 percent with 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of March.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTOR:  Well, it's a fully employed economy.  It doesn't seem to me that we should worry about it being too hot or even too cold.  So, that should really not be a market moving event, I wouldn't think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is going to drive markets then?  How are you positioning clients?  Do you want to buy stocks here or pull back?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, we're bullish on the market.  We think the S&amp;P finishes the at 3100, and -- you know, that's based on just a reasonable earnings growth rate and the market deciding by the end of the year that actually, there's not an inflation problem, the fed could stay at bay for some time and we don't have to worry about unemployment rising dramatically and a recession on pace.  However, we just ran too fast.  Too fast on the way down last year the end, and too quickly on the way up this year.  The bull, which we are, would like nice a consolidation in here.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good morning, Linda, Erin Elmore here.  Born and raised in Pittsburgh, so love your great city.  But given this period of low volatility, it looks like Fed isn't going to raise interest rates anytime soon.  What sectors, do you think, are still undervalued, that you think have an opportunity for a run-up?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, you know, we like growth, we believe it's a back half of the cycle, and so that would mean, you want to get growth, you want to get more reliable growth.  We really think that ought to have some have balance in your portfolio, because as we all know, there are a number of worries about trade around the globe, worries about China maybe falling into recession, worry about our own upcoming political season now, and what that might mean for the earnings outlooks.  A lot of exposure out there, the binary evens that we don't know how they'll work out.  And so, we think everybody ought to have some balance to their portfolio.  And that means, really, the high-quality dividend paid stocks.  I like it very much for income; they are not expensive right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, real quick before you go.  We've got the calendar one first-quarter earnings coming out beginning on Friday, with the banks, the 12th.  Would you put money to work in those areas ahead of earnings or are you expecting a tough earnings period here?  Real quick, Linda.</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, I think that the earnings season to be tough in Q1 is already understood.  Nobody cares about that as much as the outlook into the next quarter and rest of the year, and financial is really looking expensive to us, and that's one of our over weights.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We leave it there.  Linda, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Linda Duessel joining us there from Federated.  Don't miss our \"Jobs in America\" special tomorrow morning.  It kicks off 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We are identifying where the jobs are in this economy right now, all hands-on deck for jobs in America tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m. right here.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting on the Mueller investigation.  Here's what he just said: \"According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian collusion hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive.  They should focus on legislation, or even better in investigation of how ridiculous collusion delusion got started.  So illegal,\" writes the president.</p><p>A quick break and then coming up next, the border battle: President Trump is preparing to visit southern border in California tomorrow as he eases back on the shutdown threats.  The economic impact of an immigration debate, next.  And then Facebook is under fire again; the networking giant leaving hundreds of millions of users' data exposed.  The company's efforts to fix the breach, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 4th.  Your top stories right now 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are searching for direction this morning, take a look, Dow Industrials now up 18 points, the S&amp;P 500 exactly where it closed yesterday, and the NASDAQ down 10 points right now.  Investors are waiting on some news out of the China trade talks, and they are thinking that it could be good news, and it looks like the two are very disclose.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, and we do see weakness there.  FT-100 down 37 points, a half of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 12, but the DAX Index is up 26 points, even though we did get weaker-than-expected economic data, factory orders down on -- in Germany this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, with the exception of Hong Kong, as you can see.</p><p>Well, he is back behind bars, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn was rearrested last night moments before I was about to start an exclusive interview with him on the telephone.  The very latest coming up.  Privacy alert, Facebook reportedly leaving the data of millions of users exposed on Amazon servers.  How the company hopes to fix it.  Then the state of the housing market, it is getting a boost due to falling mortgage rates.  We take a closer look there later this hour.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the battle at the border.  President Trump headed to California, the California border tomorrow, as he eases back on the threat to shutdown border operations, this comes as Mexican officials are warning of port of entry delays, that's causing tens of millions of dollars in business losses.  Joining us now is the former CEO of McDonald's, former Famous Dave's Barbecue CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman, Ed Rensi.  Ed, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL:  Good morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As a business guy, what is the impact of the border closing?  Give us the news.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be significant.  I think Trump is using this as a negotiating ploy, frankly, because the impact would be staggering.  You know, you're talking about $12 billion worth of just food and produce coming across that border annually.  You look at all the car parts, medical supplies, and things of that nature, it's going to impact a lot of businesses in the United States.  I know they're working right now to try to minimize some of that stuff, but the reality is we got a sovereignty issue and our border is being penetrated.  If it were just people looking for an opportunity, that'd be one thing, but we got a lot of bad characters coming into this country and it's dangerous and we need to protect ourselves.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ed, hi.  James Freeman here at The Wall Street Journal, and kudos on naming your company FAT Brands.  Very strong.  I -- I'm wondering, as far as the -- that impact on the food service industry that you obviously focus on, we saw the news on avocados, the potential for the supply to run out within a few weeks if the Mexican imports are cut off, it goes beyond avocados and, you know, sort of millennial avocado toast jokes aside, how would the average diner notice?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, you're going to see shortages, and there'll be some things taken off the menu because you just can't get the product, whether it's avocados, or tomatoes, or whatever, these crops are going to come out of the ground and off the trees, and if they're not consumed, they're going to rot.  So, the short-term closing of the border will have a lot of long-term implications so we need to be careful about that.  I'm hopeful that this capitalist system of ours will put enough pressure on everybody in our house of -- the house of -- the Congress and Senate to start dealing with these immigrations issues in a more sensible way.</p><p>I hope it doesn't impact menu pricing, I hope it doesn't impact our ability to make money in restaurants, but it's going to be very, very difficult, to say the least, if that border closes.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  Good morning.  Erin Elmore here.  So shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to ask you about Chick-fil-A.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but two liberal cities just banned them from their airports -- San Antonio and Buffalo, given some of their social stances.  What's your take there and what advice would you give them?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, this country was founded on religious tolerance for a lot of great reasons and we have to respect each other and agree to disagree.  I get a little bit concerned when we're so intolerant about everything that we can't find common ground to solve problems and move forward.  I'm not going comment on what San Antonio does or what Chick-fil-A believes in, we all get to be who we are in this country and that's one of the great things in this country.  And I think some of these issues have taken on a preponderance of weight that's scary in a lot of ways and I hope they get it resolved sensibly and intelligently.  I think that we all, as citizens in this country, ought to have the right to exist and have a happy life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tell that to some of the academics out there, huh?  Ed, let me ask you about the minimum wage.  Target, the latest company to raise its minimum wage.  Employees going to now receive $13.00 an hour, a dollar increase from their last rates, which was, by the way, March of 2018.  The raise coming after --</p><p>RENSI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blew up Twitter over the minimum wage issue, comparing it to a $7.00 croissant.  Here's what she said, \"Croissants at LaGuardia are going for $7.00 apiece, yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal dedicated human labor for $15.00 is too expensive.\"  She tweeted it on April Fools' Day but it was no joke.  Your reaction.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I wouldn't pay $7.00 for a croissant no matter where --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are not going to buy.</p><p>RENSI:  - I bought it, whether it's Paris or anywhere else, but the reality of it is she's making a statement about the value of workers and the value of products, and I don't disagree.  I think the best system is a capitalist system that allows all wages to seek a market level, and I think Target's move is simply a reflection of the fact that we're near full-employment, and it is extremely difficult to get employees to work.  I've talked to multiple -- I had dinner with a bunch of McDonald's franchisees the other night, and they are struggling to find employees at any price.  I see some of them are $16.00, $17.00 an hour and still can't find employees.  So, let the free market determine the wage, and don't buy $7.00 croissants.  That's a bad idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, time and again, Ed, it's Dagen McDowell, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complains about the Flint water crisis.  She -- she's upset about children having asthma in the South Bronx, she's upset about a $7.00 croissant.  I'm not saying that those are on the same level of rage from her.  However, she points to where the government fails the citizens, where the government is the problem, not the solution.  Whether it's the City of New York --</p><p>RENSI:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a socialist city --</p><p>ELMORE:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- doesn't take care of its residents, can't basically help children with asthma despite a fully socialized medical system in this city, or the $7.00 croissant at LaGuardia.  Again, those rents are high because it's essentially controlled by the government.</p><p>RENSI:  A government is extremely inefficient and they ought to get out of business altogether.  You look at the Housing Authority in New York City and tens of thousands of apartments that have lead paint in them, ceilings falling down, no boilers, government is inefficient, and de Blasio is grossly underperforming what his responsibilities are.  And look at that Flint water crisis, they know what the solution is.  They need to put phosphate in the water to trap all lead, they need to get rid of all the lead pipes, they have had multiple millions of dollars spent, it's grossly inefficient, and they're not solving the problem.  I don't get it.  They ought to about thrown out in the next election, all of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Ed, let me -- let me end on this China story, because Cornerstone Macro, which I think is one of the best research shops out there, is talking about the reports yesterday that -- are talking about a deal between the U.S. and China, which would give Beijing until 2025 to meet the commitments on commodity purchases and allow U.S. firms to wholly own enterprises in China.  They think it's a weak deal and they think that this deal is a deal that Robert Lighthizer is likely to oppose privately.  It could happen because Trump wants a deal but there's a real chance they say it does not happen, because this is a weak deal.  What do you think?  Do you think a deal happens with China or not?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I think some kind of deal will likely happen, but if it's not a good deal, there'll be enough public opinion from businesspeople, and institutions of finance, that we'll soon know what the deal really looks like.  I'm very concerned about China because they want to dominate the globe as the number one entity on the planet.  It's dangerous.  They're a totalitarian system of government.  You look at the swine flu problem they've got, they consume a lot of pork, they export a lot of pork, that swine flu epidemic could wipe out their entire pork crop.  They have no means of getting rid of a hundred million hogs, they own one of the largest hog producers in the United States.  Those kinds of issues, and intellectual property theft.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RENSI:  These are really significant issues that are going to impact us for the next hundred years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've been focusing on the swine flu this morning.  You're not hearing that anywhere in the media, a hundred million pigs they have to dispose of, a hundred million dead pigs.  It pretty extraordinary, Ed.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, historically, what they have done is they dumped them in the river --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RENSI:  -- dumped them in the ocean and let God take them away, that's not going to work anymore because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>RENSI:  -- the numbers are too staggering.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a hundred million.</p><p>RENSI:  But it point -- it points out this extreme weakness of a government that functions the way they function.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ed, good to see you.</p><p>RENSI:  That problem is solvable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, Ed.  We will continue the conversation.  Thanks so much.  We will see you soon.  Ed Rensi joining us.  Coming up, home buying heats up, a wave of strong housing data shapes up the market to be the best in years.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last might when 10 agents walked in his house and took him away.  I'll share the full story later this hour.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Hey, guys.  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Volvo open hit top gear in Charleston, South Carolina Wednesday, but it was a mixed day for the red, white, and blue.  Taylor Townsend enjoyed one of the biggest wins of her career, as took out Julia Gorges to reach the third round.  The American closing out the number seven seed in the second set breaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAYLOR TOWNSEND, TENNIS PLAYER:  Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and just really go after it.  I mean I think sometimes you can play a little tentatively, but I just tried to go for it and then whatever happened, happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  The hometown favorite, Shelby Rogers, is out.  She went down to former French Open Champion, Jelena Ostapenko.  The Latvian fighting back from 5-1 down in the decider to put the win in the books to move on.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Charleston on Tennis Channel.  Our daily live coverage starts at 10 a.m. eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New mortgages soaring as loan rates hit 15-month lows.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to talk more about that.  Stuart Varney, good to see you, Stu.  Good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  You, too, Maria.  You might call this the stealth stimulus?  Maybe.  You got four percent mortgages, we got the latest mortgage numbers today in about one hour's time, could be still at four percent, as what I'm expecting, and last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association says the refi activity went up 36 percent.  Now that's a real shot in the arm for the housing industry and for real estate generally.  I think it's a shot in the arm for the economy.  If you got four percent mortgages, and what six months, seven months ago, we were talking about five percent mortgages.  I think you've got a drop here and I think that really helps everyone.</p><p>And frankly, I'm surprised at how rate-sensitive people are.  A jump of 36 percent in refi activity just because mortgages go from 4.25 percent down to four percent even?  I didn't realize that people were so rate-sensitive --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- and so pent up with demand to get in at a lower rate, but they are, and I think that's a shot in the arm for everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  And even on this program, Stu, we've heard a couple of people says that there are now green suits in housing because of --</p><p>VARNEY:  Remember that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, from way back when, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're singing it.  We're seeing it and housing, Stu.  I know more you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.  Got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his fantastic panel after the program.  But first, President Trump just tweeted again, he really just said, \"There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy.  This is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country,\" writes the President.  Coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO, he was taken away to the prosecutor's office.  I'm sharing the full story coming up.</p><p>Then privacy alert, Facebook leaves hundreds of millions of users data unprotected.  The company's efforts to fix the situation coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook under fire again, millions of users' information left exposed on a public server.  Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Hey, that's right, Maria.  Amazing story here -- Facebook two-third party Facebook app level first.  Storing user data on Amazon servers in a way that allowed them to be downloaded by the public.  The information hiding in plain sight.  Up guard, a cybersecurity firm making this information public.  The two offenders here, Cultural Collective, this is a Mexico City-based digital platform with 45 million followers.  They openly stored records on 540 million people.</p><p>At the pool, this is a defunct app.  They stored information including names, passwords, e-mail addresses on 22,000, this is the people kind of information that used to be freely available, and Facebook itself has tried to crack down on it.  Meanwhile, Guggenheim has raised its rating to a buy and privacy concerns here remain.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All, right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS:  Welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, we're going to talk about what's going on in Japan.  Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars, I'm going to tell you all about it.  The details, as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the Former CEO last night when he was arrested.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's end where we began the program.  Japanese authorities rearrested former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn facing new chargers, financial misconduct.  He's denying any wrongdoing.  Saying in a statement, \"My arrest this morning is outrageous in arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals to -- at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I'm innocent of these groundless charges and accusations.\"</p><p>It was a dramatic evening.  I was back at work last night at about 5:30 p.m. because we were about to do an exclusive interview.  He was going to call into the show and I was going to bring you that interview this morning.  As we were about to get started, he was calling into the show.  Ten agents burst it into his apartment and put him in a room and talk to him and then took him away.  They then -- they were both still in their pajamas, Carlos and his wife, Carole.  They then were voluntarily forcing Carole Ghosn to answer questions.</p><p>His wife, she said, after the agents left, \"I wanted to use the bathroom.  The officer entered the bathroom with me and did the body check.  They kept the bathroom door open while I used the bathroom.\"  A female prosecutor stayed in the shower with Carole while she showered.  They are trying to break him.  The whole point here is to get Carlos Ghosn to admit to something.  He remains saying he's innocent.  Guys.</p><p>ELMORE:  Japan has a 99 percent conviction rate, so this looks really bad for Ghosn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the prosecution has not presented any evidence, eventually we'll hear it.  We would hope -- well, eventually, we would hope to hear his side of the story as well.  Renault has raised questions about his expenses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK.  So that -- you're saying that Renault did their own investigation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we will keep following this.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  I will.</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 4, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 040402cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Tesla's Troubles; E-Cigarette Crackdown; College Admissions Scandal; Brexit Debate; President Donald Trump to Visit the Border Wall; Interview with Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 4th.</p><p>Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are waiting on any China trade news.  The President will meet with China's top negotiator today at the White House.</p><p>Markets are flat, S&amp;P 500 down a fraction, Dow Jones Industrial average up a fraction.  This after markets were little changed yesterday.  The Nasdaq was the top performer on the day yesterday.  It was up two-thirds of 1 percent, 46 points higher.  The other major indices higher but just fractionally.  Dow Industrials up about 39 points yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the story and it is mixed.  FT 100 down 30 points.  CAC 40 in Paris down 9 points.  But the DAX index in Germany up 26.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher as you can see here with the exception of Hong Kong.</p><p>We are waiting on the jobs report.  It's jobs Friday tomorrow, that may very well be a market mover.</p><p>Cracking down on e-cigarettes.  The FDA is warning of serious health concerns after some users are reporting they're getting seizures after vaping.</p><p>The college admissions scandal continues.  Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman appearing in a Boston court yesterday, after they signed autographs outside.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Plus the vests take over Wall Street.  But now the company behind them, Patagonia, is saying no more.  Wait until you hear that story.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Republican strategist Erin Elmore.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>Jamie Dimon has his annual letter out.  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase out with his annual letter.  And he writes this, \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.</p><p>The letter has become something that Jamie Dimon is real proud of, you know, as he takes a whack at policy issues and talks about concerns for the country, not just JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes.  I think China obviously the big issue on the table.  I think he's speaking for the business community, where they don't like tariffs but they recognize that the game in China is not fair to foreign companies.  It's not fair on intellectual property, et cetera.</p><p>Larger policy points in there, I think some of them are laudable.  But I don't like the idea that businesses have a sort of a social responsibility to advocate for different public policies.  I think the job of a bank, for example, and his bank does it very well, is to fund businesses, allow companies to grow, allow people to have the financial services and I think that's a great service.  You don't need to be involved in public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This reads like a 10-point plan for a man who is running for the nomination of some party.  I don't know which party it is.</p><p>But he talks about infrastructure spending and the infrastructure plan to improve our highways and such.  That is the role of the government, how to pay for it is the question.  Also things like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Education.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- education.  Those are the big l policy issues.  I mean, he's kind of -- again, tell us something we don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He says ten ways to address what's holding back growth and opportunity, education, healthcare costs, regulatory reform, infrastructure, tax system, litigation reform, immigration reform, mortgage reform, labor market, budgeting and planning.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Jamie Dimon, 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, he said he's not going to run.</p><p>ELMORE:  No, no.  Definitely not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's not woke enough, I don't think, to certainly win the Democratic nomination and you already got like a Howard Schultz possibly running as an independent candidate.  I wasn't suggesting that.  I'm just saying it reads like a policy platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  You're absolutely right.  But I will say this, he's probably going to be getting some good news recently -- good news in the near term on China because the Chinese are agreeing to open up their markets, particularly to financial services.</p><p>UBS was the first bank to get an opportunity to own a bank out and out, 51 percent.  But it looks like financial services are going to be the first industry that really gets a shot to sell to the 1.4 billion people in China, which is a big opportunity.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And if you look at what the Chinese have said recently, it sounds like reform.  Obviously, there's this question, and this is sort of the sticking point in the trade negotiations right now, what is the enforcement mechanism?  When do you take the tariffs off?  How do you punish if they're not following the deal.</p><p>I think on the U.S. side, they are convinced that Liu He is a genuine reformer.  He wants to move the Chinese economy toward open markets, the rule of law, respect for property.  Can he sell that to Xi Jinping who is really an old-fashioned communist.  And we'll hear from Gordon Chang who obviously covers this extremely well but covers this extremely well.  But that's really the he question, I think is can He sell that reform opportunity back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm expecting that meeting between the President and Xi Jinping in May, early May, is the guidance that I'm getting in terms of the meeting in Mar-a-Lago -- that must mean reform that they are really down to the final items as we told you yesterday actually.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we've got a great show.</p><p>Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is here.  He'll be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and House agriculture committee member Jeff Van Drew.  We'll get both of their ideas.</p><p>Plus the author of \"The Coming Collapse Of China\", Gordon Chang is with us to talk about where we are in that deal.  And former McDonald's CEO, and Fat Brands international chairman Ed Rensi joining is us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Now to the Securities and Exchange Commission versus Elon Musk, the Tesla chief headed to court today over his controversial tweets that have triggered a legal t battle between his company and the SEC.   A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the agency which is the court to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement.</p><p>Joining us now is ARK investment analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha Keeney.  Tasha it's god to see you.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ARK INVESTMENT ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>Have you been trading or recommending this stock in light of all this -- Tesla?</p><p>KEENEY:  In light of the SEC Investigation?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Keeney:  Well, we know -- we don't try to predict legal outcomes.  We certainly don't know.  But you know, Dagen I heard you say earlier, you don't think that he'll be removed as CEO.  That's really most important to us.  We want him to stay at the helm of the company.  Especially if Tesla is still reaching for autonomy with its vehicles which what we think the largest market opportunity ahead of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Think about the outrage about that, if a federal judge because of a tweet -- a tweet violates a settlement with a securities regulator which has no really criminal authority over companies, it has -- it can file civil cases, having a judge remove a CEO for a tweet ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want to remove President Trump for his lies; for his tweets.</p><p>ELMORE:  And Tasha How do you manage your expectations given the fact that Elon Musk has such volatility in his behavior?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, we look at Musk really as a visionary.  He's accomplished the impossible.  I mean he's changing the face of the auto industry.  So there's a lot of transparency in what he does because he uses Twitter.</p><p>And he has made mistakes in the past and he's admitted those and paid for those mistakes.</p><p>You know, I think, again, for the long term goal of the company in terms of getting to full autonomy, being a leader in electric vehicles, he seems to have a accomplished that.  We're happy so far with how things are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company's new vehicle deliveries plummeted 31 percent in the first quarter.  Tesla is citing challenges associated with taking the Model 3 overseas for the first time.  How are they going to deal with this?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know,  it think there's too much focus on deliveries.  Again, with an innovative company like this you have to look at the long-term picture.  So if Tesla's late by say a month or what have you on those numbers -- I mean, are they -- it's still the best selling mid-size premium sedan.  I mean there's no demand issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: but again but it doers reflect and the \"Wall Street Journal\" writes about this in its analysis today.</p><p>\"Tesla has trouble planning.  And if you're going to be in the manufacturing business, you really need to learn how to cross your t's and dot your i's so-to-speak.  Because Tesla produced 22 percent more cars than it was able to deliver in the first quarter.  This shows in part a logistics problem.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to hurt income --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's more likely but Elon Musk kind -- and Tasha can attack about this.   Elon Musk kind of forecast several weeks ago -- we were talking, remember about the debt payment.  It was really about him saying that the company might not be profitable in the first quarter after two straight quarters of producing a profit because of some of the issues.</p><p>And in part, they are losing that tax credit as well.  It was at $7,500.  Now it's essentially been cut in half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stock is down 8 percent right now.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  Exactly.  So I think -- well, so one, in terms of profitability, I think so Tesla said they have enough cash on-hand at the end of the quarter and I think in general with the delivery figures, I mean, have you to ask yourself, are these logistic challenges going to kill the company?  No.  You know.</p><p>If you're a long-term investor, I don't think this should phase you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wanted to ask about the tweets.  Obviously this is a mechanism to speak to the markets and the company has said that, but people just like with the president, they argue are the tweets critical to his success or is he hurting himself with tweets.</p><p>I wonder how you view the Musk communications generally, whether it's Twitter, whether it's going on pod casts and smoking weed -- is this part of the brand and part of the genius or is it a downside and you wish he would stop talking?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, again, as I said earlier, with Twitter we get a lot of transparency.  And you don't get that with other CEOs.  So I think in a lot of ways investors, this gives us more information.  Now, sometimes he does unpredictable things like the 420 but in general, you know, 420 tweet.</p><p>In general, again, we see the board supporting Musk which is really important for an innovative company like Tesla.  And, you know, as we look forward as the auto industry transitions to electric autonomous vehicles, Tesla's years ahead of the competition.</p><p>And so we don't think that little blips like this are going to sort of affect that competitive advantage that Tesla's built in terms of batteries, in terms of autonomous hardware and in terms of autonomous data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you don't even need to look ahead to autonomous vehicles.  I had this discussion with someone I'm very close to over the weekend who works in Silicon Valley.  Every other automaker, even luxury automakers in Germany, Japanese and American -- they are awful at software.</p><p>There is no other car and no other car company that compares to a Tesla.  We all as drivers and consumers ought to be rooting for this company.  You don't have to own stock in it but you ought to be rooting for them because hopefully all these other automakers will realize oh, our software stinks.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  And automakers really haven't even owned that part of the supply chain.  The software side of things.  They're bringing in all of these components from different suppliers and Tesla's vertically integrated.</p><p>So this is a huge challenge to the traditional companies.  And I mean if you don't -- just take one thing over the air updates.  the car gets better overnight.  Why haven't other automakers been able to do this?  I mean it's ridiculous that Tesla's actually been doing this for years now.  And no one has caught up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they're dug in and they literally don't know now to run a car company in the new century.  That's literally what these companies look like.</p><p>If you -- I'm surprised.  And I'm surprised that Apple and Google haven't done more to try and manufacture a car or produce software for one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How secured is Tesla's funding?</p><p>Keeney:  So, you know, I think in general if we look at funding for Tesla, ok, so say if you were worried about cash, we actually as investors would be ok with an equity dilution because we just want them to get as many cars on the road as possible.  Each of the cars acts like a mini R&amp;D center.  It collects data for Tesla and it gets it toward that vision of full autonomy because Machine learning improves with the more data you feed it.</p><p>So we're actually factoring in a $10 billion to $20 billion equity dilution over the next five years.  And again, we would be ok with that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How soon do they need to raise more capital?</p><p>KEENEY:  So you know they've again, they said that they're ok with cash at the end of the quarter.  So no immediate expectations for that to happen.  Now, if things were to change which we certainly think they could, again, that would be ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just to be clear, the stock is down almost 9 percent right now.  Would you buy it here?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, I can't say whether or not we would buy or sell but you know, again, our long term visit .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to tell clients something, right?</p><p>KEENEY:  Well, you know, the market hasn't opened yet.  But the long-term vision for Tesla has not changed.</p><p>I mean we still think they're the largest producer of batteries in the world.  They're the only company that's collecting data off its customer cars on the road, we've seen every other company that's working on autonomous driving have issues, Waymo is having technical issues, the commercial launch was much watered down than what se expected.</p><p>I mean Tesla could launch a fully autonomous car in the next couple of years and then they're really going to run away from the competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I still think he's acted like a jerk in the past but again, like I said everybody in this country ought to be rooting for the success of this company in one way shape or form because it is 's the way of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tasha -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Tasha Keeney, ARK Investment.</p><p>Coming up a major e-cigarettes warning this morning, dozens of users reporting to the FDA that they're suffering features.  The health risk around vaping coming up.</p><p>And then changing the Wall Street\" uniform.  Patagonia takes a stand when it comes to which companies wear its clothes.  Stay with us.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A new potential health risk for e-cigarette users.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Pretty serious one, Maria.</p><p>The Food and Drug administration is revealing about three dozen reports of seizures among e-cigarette users, mainly younger people.  Nicotine poisoning is believed to cause seizures and even brain injury.  Last month the FDA outlined new restrictions on sales of most flavored e-cigs to fight underage use of them.</p><p>Well, billionaire/investor, Carl Icahn reportedly sold his stake in Lyft to fellow billionaire, George Soros before the company's IPO last week.  Sources telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Icahn held about a 2.7 percent stake in Lyft which was valued at about $550 million -- that's the IPO price.</p><p>It is not known why Icahn sold his stake or how much Soros paid for it.  Lyft is up about a fraction of a percent this morning.</p><p>Three global automakers teaming up to create safety standards for self-driving cars.  Ford, GM and Toyota plan to set up the automated vehicle safety consortium, focusing on building a safety framework for autonomous vehicles.  Self-driving cars have come under increased scrutiny since, of course, the fatal crash of an Uber test vehicle last year.  The Ford, GM, Toyota initiative is notable because it involves large car makers but no technology firms who probably will want to weigh in on any new rules.</p><p>And those are your headlines -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  all right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the delay in the U.K., trying to avoid a no deal exit from the European Union.  British lawmakers are now looking for another deadline extension.  We've got the details out of London coming up.  then the college admissions scandal, Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman facing a judge.  The courtroom drama coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  British lawmakers are voting to force prime minister Theresa May to ask the E.U. for another extension to exit the European Union.</p><p>Ashley Webster with the very latest right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We go around and around and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Round and round and round.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- and around we go.  Nothing much as changes other than yes there is a bill that whisked it went through the House of commons yesterday, basically telling Theresa May that she must go to The European Union and ask for an extension which, by the way, the new deadline is a week from tomorrow.</p><p>That went through the House of commons.  It's now in the House of Lords.  It's kind of like the House and the Senate in the U.K.</p><p>Generally nothing of interest ever happens in the House of Lords so this is ground-breaking by itself, that they're actually debating this issue in the House of Lords and doing it quickly.  Nothing quickly happens in the House of Lords.</p><p>And now there's a belief that some conservatives in the House of Lords are so upset with this whole process they may filibuster.  They may talk for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to try to prevent this from going through.</p><p>The bottom line ok, Prime Minister go ask for another deadline from the E.U. It doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.  for the an tension, doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.</p><p>What's interesting is this whole affair has not really moved forward in three years.  You can't come to a majority, a consensus on what the plan is to get the heck out of the E.U.</p><p>What's interesting though is there's a new poll out in the U.K., that says 83 percent of U.K. citizens, sick of talking about Brexit, 64 percent believe it's harmful to their mental health.</p><p>I think we can all agree with that.  But it's certainly --</p><p>And another interesting angle to this, Maria and gang, there are 10,000 riot police that have been undergoing extensive training in the last couple of weeks.  They are ready to deploy in a heartbeat.  That doesn't mean to say they're going to be needed but there has been a ramping up of emotions</p><p>The number of crimes related to Brexit have doubled in the last two weeks.  Not a huge amount but there are incidents where harsh rhetoric is now being translated into actual action.  And there's actual a concern if this continues to drag on and Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British people in that referendum, that things could spill on the streets.</p><p>There are 10,000 riot troops ready to go.  It's a little .   And there's a concern if this continues to drag on and the Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British riot troops ready to go.</p><p>It's a little bit of a scare thing.  Haven't been used and so far, it's been pretty civil, I have to say.  But there's no doubt tensions and emotions are frayed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are always people looking for a reason to loot, aren't they?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly in France.  There's always a small group of anarchists who will jump onto any cause just so they can smash up some shops.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And get what?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Get some free jeans.  Get free stuff.  There's always that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Ashley's -- East London accent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes. But there are people who would jump on any cause just to create problems.  So there is that kind of lurking in the background.</p><p>Bottom line is can Theresa May survive this?  Who knows?  Who would want her job right now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But if she cuts a deal with the Labour Party --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  this is going to be either no Brexit or something that's VERY close to no Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It's going to be a very soft Brexit.  And you know, will Corbyn insist on a second referendum, no matter what deal they make, the choice going back to the people, saying this is the deal we've got.</p><p>Vote for this or we forget the whole thing and stay in Europe.  That could be the next move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will that do to markets.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Uncertainties, sterling ha taken another hit.  We know  that it's funny, you know the economic news out of Europe, German manufacturing again came out really poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Italy and Germany GDP were cut.</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is not a good time economically for the E.U. and certainly the U.K. slowed down.  None of this is good because of the uncertainty.  Businesses aren't spending.  Businesses don't know what to do, especially if you have a lot of exposure to the continent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This referendum the people voted for -- they voted for Brexit --</p><p>WEBSTER:  52 to 48 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is basically being ignored on the installment plan, by the politicians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It was always 70 something percent of MPs who voted to remain and there's this strong belief that they would do anything they can to prevent it from happening. And one way to do that is to drag it out, get the U.K. involved in the European parliament elections coming up in May.  They do that this thing gets pushed further and further and further down the line.  And that happens is no Brexit.  That is the fear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all having an impact across the world.  I'm glad you mentioned the factory orders report out of Germany because you're the Eurozone economic numbers do not look good.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning the GDP expectations for Italy and Germany were cut again.  They're lucky to get 1 percent growth if at all in the Eurozone.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.  Completely stagnant.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That has to hit the U.S. at some point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course it does.  And you know, no matter what you think of the E.U. it's a huge trading bloc.  It is enormous and there's a lot of business done between the U.S. and the E.U. So it is going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to say, meantime you have political candidates here in the United States pointing to Europe as kind of the gold standard.  Yes, their economy can't grow.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is what socialism gets you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This could be an upside for us.  I was talking to one European BANK and he was saying this all of this debate and concern and uncertainty helps New York remain the world's financial center.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It does.  It's the only game in town.  And where are you going to put your money right now?  U.S. equities look pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Are American businesses, JPMorgans of the world, have they made a plan to stay in the U.K. or move some of their people to Germany?  What's the story.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There have been a lot of movement.  Bank of America moved a lot of its employees out of the -- out of London and to Dublin, to Ireland because their because they'll remain in the E.U.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I THINK There's no obvious competitor in Europe, Dublin, Frankfurt maybe has an argument, but I think London remains the European financial center because of the tradition, rule of law, people want to operate there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly hope so.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that's probably true regardless of what the is.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  I think you're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ashley -- great stuff.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ashley Webster with the latest there.</p><p>Coming up, the border battle, we're taking you live to the border next.</p><p>Plus, I'll be talking with two lawmakers about the economic impact, if the President closes the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>And then millennials in the housing market.

But first, our top story this half an hour, the border battle, President Trump will visit the southern border in California tomorrow.  Griff Jenkins is at the border in McAllen, Texas right now.  Griff, good morning.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We just got some numbers here in the Rio Grande Valley.  I'm just steps from the border here.  That there were over 1,100 apprehensions of illegal crossers last night.  That is the 13th day of more than a thousand apprehensions that they're having in this surge of migrants, many of them family units.  We encountered more than 180 when we spent all day with the border patrol out on watch.  But they don't all surrender peacefully seeking asylum, sometimes they seek to evade being caught.  And we went into the sticks with them.  It's tough work.  Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  It's unbelievably difficult terrain.  I'm cut, my gloves torn.  This man rushing through here and we found a group, this is the first one we found, just nothing but thorns, bushes, bugs, snakes, spiders.</p><p>This is a spotlight.  You can see (INAUDIBLE), there they are.  They've got two more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) they tried to run.  This one right here was hiding underneath this brush to my left and this one right here just got up from the brush and took off running south but I was able to get him before he went got away.</p><p>JENKINS:  This is the brush underneath here, right where I am, where the last illegal crosser was laid down and Herman had to crawl in like this and go through these bushes and thorns.  It's just treacherous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  And that is not an extraordinary night by any stretch.  That's what they go through every night here.  Also folks are worried about this border closing.</p><p>As you know, Maria, Mexico is Texas' biggest trade partner to the tune of $187 billion.  We wait to see what happens as DHS Secretary Nielsen visits Arizona today, the president to California tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, it really looks like a crisis there, Griff.  Thank you.  Griff Jenkins joining us in McAllen this morning.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to close the southern border all together.  Mexican officials along the border are warning a port of entry delays are already causing tens of millions of dollars in losses for companies that do business along the border.  White House Economic director Larry Kudlow said that there's a way to keep freight lanes open should the border close.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE:  But regarding the economic impact of closing the border, which has not -- the president has not made a decision yet, as you know, I'm not aware that he has, one area we've explored is to try to keep the freight lanes open.  The truck lanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is congressman and House Agricultural Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Thanks, and it's always a pleasure to be here with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to this news this morning.  We're seeing the lines get longer.  We're seeing a lot of worry over the threat that the president could close the border.  How do you see it?</p><p>VAN DREW:  I sure -- I certainly hope he doesn't have to close the border.  I wouldn't want to see that.  It's obviously not good for business, it's not good for the economy.  So I'm hopeful that we can work this out.</p><p>Yet another example, and I know I drive it over and over again, but where we just need to have -- you know, more conversation, more bipartisanship.  We really need to do more here at the border to try to straighten this out.  If we can get the border under control, then we won't have the problem at the ports of entry with moving things through quickly enough.  And that's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, congressman, this is one of those examples of there are real issues happening in the country and in the world and instead, we have been focused in the last two years on this collusion narrative.  I know that you have come to Washington to get things done.  How are you dealing with your colleagues that seem to only want to take down Donald Trump and have ignored all of the issues going on that affect the American people?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I had a serious conversation with some of them just last night where we sat around a table and talked about it and I agree with exactly what you're saying.  I want to get things done.  People don't even realize at this point the bills that you hear about moving through the House of Representatives.  Most of them, the vast majority of them are not going anywhere.  They're going to get stopped at the senate, because, again, we're not having that conversation.  They're not moving through and becoming law.</p><p>So, I think at so many levels we need to take care of the issues that are real, whether it's Social Security, Medicare, healthcare, making sure that our veterans are taken care of.  I can go through an entire list for about 10 minutes of things that we need to do.  We need to get past this other part.</p><p>So, we're going to get the report.  Let's get the report, get as much that -- of it that is legal, and I want to emphasize that, that we legally can get, take a look at it.  If there's something there, deal with it.  If there's nothing there, that is horrendous, let's move on.  Let's get laws passed that -- you know, really can make a difference.  Let's get our business sector going even better.  Let's take care of the border issues so that we don't have what's now -- was first just a crisis of safety, is now also a humanitarian crisis and a business crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes for sure.  Then there's China and this of course impacts your constituents being on the Agricultural Committee.  I want to ask you about what's going on in China because I heard a story last night which really concerned me.  There is a swine flu outbreak in China, this deadly virus said to be spreading throughout the country, affecting a shocking number of pigs.  China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  But apparently 20 percent of the pigs are sick from this swine flu and they've got a hundred million pigs to dispose of.  Dead pigs.</p><p>In the past they would put the pigs in the -- in the ocean and just leave it.  But there are literally a hundred million dead pigs in China.  Have you heard about this?  Do you think there's going to be an impact to our agriculture?  Some people expect that this situation is going to ripple through different meats, chicken and steak, in terms of prices.  It's going to push all prices higher.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher, there's no question.  When -- you're going to have a shortage of meat and you're going to certainly going to have a shortage of pork and the prices are going to go up, number one.</p><p>Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God we have got a good Department of AGs to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.  Just to -- you know, arrest everybody's fears, this is nothing that you or I can catch from eating something.  This is something that goes from animal to animal through a variety of ways, sometimes when they eat waste that is infected from the flies and the transient insects that move around.  But it's a serious issue.  It's another serious issue.  It's another economic issue.  These are the types of issues that government should be working on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting out of a China deal?  The president is expected to tell us later today when he will meet President Xi in Mar-a-Lago.  I'm thinking -- I'm hearing it's either end of April, but likely -- more likely the beginning of May.  Do you think the U.S. is going to be able to get an enforcement mechanism in there to ensure that the Chinese do not steal intellectual property from America?</p><p>VAN DREW:  It may not be as good as we would want, but it's got to be better than it is.  Because it's something we can't put up with anymore.  And the stealing of intellectual property, the tampering with their monetary system as you know and many of the other things that they do are things that we just can't tolerate.  I think there's truth to those who say that for too long China has had the better end of the deal and I think we have to protect our American interest.</p><p>So I think this, again, is another very, very important issue that we've got to work on.  I think we're going to do better.  I believe we're going to do better.  But you know, Maria, this is going to be some hard, tough negotiating that's going to take place.  We're not playing with amateurs here.  These folks are serious.  And they're serious about being the new number one in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And they're looking long term but I think during the whole -- you know, Mueller report drama, the Chinese were questioning if they're even going to have to deal with Donald Trump.  Now after we know officially no collusion, the Chinese are saying we might have to deal with this guy for another eight years.  It just also underlines how irresponsible there was -- it was out there, the media, the Democrats, you know, parading around with this collusion story, basically giving an upper hand to the Chinese while he's trying to do a deal with them.</p><p>You mentioned the Mueller report a moment ago.  It's going to come out.  The Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 to subpoena the entire report.  Some members of the special counsel team reportedly saying that the results are more damaging to President Trump than Attorney General William Barr led on, that's coming from the New York Times today, the New York Times is clinging to this narrative, obviously.  Would the A.G. hide something?  I mean, would the new A.G. hide something in the Mueller report?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, call me naive, but I really believe in the system of law.  And I believe he wants to ensure to keep his good name, so I believe he's going to release what is supposed to be released.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the grand jury testimony, right, though?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Correct.  He can't release that.  That's by law.  But those areas where we're not going to hurt people, not the grand jury testimony, not something obviously that's confidential for certain reasons but the majority of it, a good piece of that report could be released.</p><p>And if that's true, then that will come out.  I'm one -- let me say this, you know, I'm a Democrat.  But frankly, I was glad when it seems to be that there might not be much there because it's important that we can move forward for the next year and-a-half that our president can be effective.  We're going to have an election, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  When we have that election, we can hash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let the voters decide.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Exactly.  Let the voters decide.  Let's hash this out.  Let's have the big, grand argument that everybody wants to have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Right now is the time to accomplish goals and get things done.  And the China deal is an example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one thing that the voters are going to decide on -- one thing that the voters are going to decide on are some of these radical ideas, congressman.  I mean, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill for CEOs to receive jail time after data breaches.  Warren treated this yesterday, today I'm proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families.  Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you'll go to jail.  She wants to make it easier for CEOs to go to jail, congressman.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I think if they've done something truly wrong, truly hurtful and truly illegal, then there can be some truth to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  But I don't necessarily love a full-fledged attack that's occurring in certain sectors on business in general.  That business is bad, that the capitalistic system is bad, that we should change the whole playing field.  You know, I've said this to you before I'm a capitalist.  I'm proud to be a capitalist.  I'm a capitalist and I like to -- you know, have a little phone that I'm a compassionate capitalist.  But that -- I mean that for real that -- you know, there is a place for government.  We want to make sure people don't fall through the cracks.  This is not just Laissez-faire capitalism.</p><p>However, we want to make sure that this economic engine that is taking so many of us to such good places in so many ways is even expanded more and even takes more of us and enables us to live the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well-said, congressman.  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Van Drew.</p><p>Coming up, the college admissions scandal is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Constellation Brands out with earnings right now.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We've got the numbers, Maria.  Constellation Brands reporting better than expected results for Q4.  The company posting adjusted profit of a $1.84 a share, revenue of $1.8 billion.  The company also selling about 30 of its lower priced wine brands to E. &amp; J. Gallo for $1.7 billion.  Some of the names, Clos du Bois, Mark West wines and several others.  Shares of Constellation Brands higher in the premarket.</p><p>All right.  Well, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin appearing for the first time in federal court in Boston over the college admissions scandal.  Both are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.  Prosecutors reportedly asking for jail time for everyone charged in the case.  Now the actresses have forfeited their passports.  Loughlin, we should ask, stopped to sign autographs outside of the courthouse after her appearance, Aunt Becky fans in Boston yesterday.</p><p>All right, Patagonia no longer selling its popular vest through corporate sales programs.  These vests with finance from logos on them , kind of a wardrobe staple on Wall Street if you're a New Yorker, especially for those workers that trade in those formal suits for that more casual look for the trading floor.  Patagonia says it wants to add new businesses to its client list, ones that quote, meet certain environmental, social and transparency standards.  The company adding existing corporate customers can remain in the program.  OK, way to make your views there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Patagonia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too much.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, real estate is heating up.  Investors are finding it's the perfect time to make a buck in the housing market.  Details on the making -- the money making opportunity rather.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeted on the GOP.  Here's what the president writes, the Republican Party is the party of the American dream.</p><p>Well, let's talk about that because spring has sprung for potential home buyers, falling rates and increased inventory pushing a buyer's market.  Joining us now to give us the state of business is Dolly Lenz Real Estate co-founder, Dolly Lenz and Dolly Lenz Real Estate managing director, Jenny Lenz.  Jenny and Dolly, it is good to see you both.</p><p>DOLLY LENZ, CO-FOUNDER, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  You too.</p><p>JENNY LENZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Asses the market for us, what are you expecting this summer in real estate?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Well, we're seeing a lot more inquiries, we're seeing lots of people at open houses, which is great, right?  That starts the process.  And we're seeing people happy that it's spring.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right?  They go outside, there's flowers blooming.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you think the prices are going to come down?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Yes.  But it doesn't mean they're not going to take advantage of those prices coming down, right?  Buyers will buy if they get a bargain.  So they're looking for that bargain.  Interest rates are so good now that anybody looking to buy is saving, what, 0.3 percent from just a month ago.</p><p>J. LENZ:  And as sellers become more realistic, you know, we're going to see a lot more traction, a lot more buyers in the market.  As she said, you know, spring is just the best time of year for New Yorkers.  It really is a seasonal, somewhat of a seasonal market.  No one wants to go see stuff in the winter, it's cold, everything looks terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about the millionaire's tax?  Let's get into the taxes that are -- that are taking effect.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Not good -- not good.  Millionaire's tax is really another trifecta problem, right?  So, large supply of inventory, over-supply of inventory, lack of foreign buyers and now this tax, right?  And plus the original tax, it's not good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The cap on state and local tax deductions.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deduction on the mortgage interest (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>D. LENZ:  Which isn't even a cap, it's really a elimination, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Because most people pay more than $10,000, so it is an elimination of real estate tax reductions.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The number transactions in Manhattan in the first quarter I read was the lowest in 10 years.  So it is having -- people don't want to buy in high tax states for myriad reasons.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, and we're also seeing the huge move down to places like Florida because it's not a -- you know, a tax state.</p><p>J. LENZ:  Right, and ultimately, this will all be priced into condos in Manhattan, right?  If you're going to make us pay higher taxes, we're not going to pay as much for an apartment.  That's what we're seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, just to be clear, James, in California high earners are taxed 9.3 percent, plus an additional one percent surcharge on income over a million dollars.  On the opposite coast, New York's upper cast taxed 8.82 percent on income over a million in 2018.  And that's not including an additional millionaire's tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Or the New York city tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait a minute, we don't get the California weather either.  So maybe there's not a good deal there.  (INAUDIBLE) OK, so not a lot of buyers, prices lately not that firm.  One, the people who are looking to buy, what are they looking for?  Is it different from previous times?</p><p>D.

And Happy Thursday, everybody, thanks for joining us.  Good morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Carlos Ghosn back behind bars this morning.  Last night, what an unbelievable night I had.  I was about to start an exclusive interview on the telephone with the former Nissan CEO when all of a sudden, 10 agents stormed into his apartment and arrested him.  Took him away in a car.  I'll tell you all about it, the full story coming up.</p><p>Startling new details this morning in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, preliminary results of the investigation blaming Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.  Tesla deliveries heading reverse, the automaker reporting a decline of more than 30 percent in the first quarter.  Plus, the Securities and Exchange Commission case over Elon Musk's tweets, that's headed to court today.  Meanwhile this, Conor McGregor may be coming out of retirement.  The cryptic tweet that's sending shockwaves through the MMA world this morning.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And good morning.  The markets this morning are showing some declines.  Take a look at Futures edging lower with investors focusing on the U.S.-China trade talks this morning, as authorities in Japan re-arrest former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn is now facing new charges of financial misconduct.  He denies any wrongdoing.  I spoke with Ghosn this week.  He said in a statement last night, my arrest this morning is outrageous and arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman; and republican strategist Erin Elmore.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see everybody.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what a night last night.  We scheduled an interview with Carlos Ghosn at 5:30 p.m. last night.  I came back to work, I'm sitting there, getting ready for the interview.  I'm texting with his lawyer, his lawyer says, OK, he's going to be calling in momentarily.  Now, it's 10 to 6:00, we're waiting for Carlos to call in to discuss the interview.  I had already spoken with Carlos Ghosn over the weekend on Saturday, and he discussed the charges, told me everything that you've heard here first for the last 100 days, that this was a coup, he's denying all of these charges and saying that he is innocent.</p><p>All of a sudden, I get this text from the lawyers, 10 agents just showed up, they are -- they took him into a room, they're in the room alone with Carole, his wife, Carole and Carlos Ghosn in the room with prosecutors, talking for a few minutes.  Then, we see them take Carlos in the car and drive away.  They took him to the prosecutor's office and they interrogated him.  He was there -- we were unclear if they were going to put him back in detention or if they were just going to question him.  In the meanwhile, agents went back to the house and they started interrogating his wife, Carole Ghosn.</p><p>Now, part of the reason here is because, as you remember, he put out that tweet a week ago, saying I'm going to -- it's time for me to tell the truth, to tell everyone what's going on, that he wanted to give a press conference, he was expecting to give a press conference on April 11th next week, they did not like the fact that he was going to discuss publicly, I believe, his phones obviously are tapped, the phone is lawyer -- a phone from his lawyer and I believe they are probably tapping Carole Ghosn's phone as well.  Because they probably knew that he was about to talk to the media, he was going to do this interview with me.  And so, they went right when we were going to do the interview, at 10 to 6:00 in the morning.</p><p>Then, they went back, they interrogated Carole Ghosn.  And they -- she wanted to go to the bathroom, they went in the bathroom with her.  She wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the bathroom, in the shower, while she was in the shower, taking a shower.  They want to break him.  The judicial system in japan is such that they want a confession on all of these charges, something that he is refusing to give.  This is an extraordinary situation, it is getting worse.  He is once again behind bars.  He could be there another -- he could be there 10 days and then they could add another 10 days to it, meaning he'll be there another 20 days before he can apply for bail to come out before a trial.  All Carlos Ghosn is asking for is a fair trial.  It doesn't look like he's going to get one.</p><p>ELMORE:  Would you know this, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>ELMORE:  That in Japan, there's a 99 percent conviction rate.  So, the odds are really stacked against him here.  He's also asking that the other defendants, his colleague, Greg Kelly and Nissan itself will be in a separate trial, so then he will get a more fair trial.  However, what I heard from Japanese legal experts is that once you've been released on bail once, you're not likely to be rearrested once, twice, or even three times which has happened to him here.  So, the odds are truly stacked against him.  It does not look good for him.  99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wasn't going anywhere.  He was not a flight risk.  He was in an apartment that was approved by the Japanese government.  He wasn't violating any parole, but they went and they took him.  Now, this new charge that they're trying to make is that he sent money to a company in Oman, Jordan and he used that money, and then he used the money -- and then they paid him to buy a yacht, to spend money on personal items.  That cannot be proven.  I mean, money is fungible, there's no way to say that the money that Nissan paid to this dealer in Oman was the money that he used to buy his yacht.  It's just -- it's very hard case to make.  His team believes that one of the reasons that they went back to arrest him overnight is because their case is falling apart.</p><p>Now, Carlos Ghosn told me on the phone over the weekend, the reason that this all happened, this coup happened underneath him is because the company was not doing well.  The company was collapsing.  His underlings thought they would, number one, be fired; and number two, that he was going to merge the company with Renault.</p><p>He told me he wasn't planning on merging the company with Renault.  However, he was planning a lot more consolidation, and he was in fact, having to fire people.  He had to consolidate because the company, if you look at the stock chart, if you look at the losses, if you look at the decline in revenue, the company was not doing well.  I don't know how Nissan does any better.  I mean, I'm sure that there are going to be activists that want to boycott Nissan, boycott Japan.  I mean, for a foreigner operating in Japan, what does this look like to you, James?  This is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you certainly had a situation where the Japanese managers at the company did not want him in charge, did not want to be run by a European company.  So, I think that's one of the big questions about this case, along with obviously a lot of people as they got to know the Japanese legal system over the last several months, seeing how long someone can be detained without access to a lawyer, pretty shocking.  But also this question of why now?  Why -- he's been running the organization for years and then all of a sudden when they see this potential consolidation of power in Europe, not in Japan, the Japanese executives come up with these charges against him.  Very suspicious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're also coming up with reasons to question Carole Ghosn.  They took her passport, they took her phone, she no longer has the phone.  He no longer has a phone.  They said sources close to Carole said that they wanted her to voluntarily answer questions.  When I wanted to use the bathroom, the officer entered the bathroom with me and did a body check.  When I wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the shower with her while she showered.  They wanted to humiliate Carole Ghosn, they wanted to intimidate her, and they want to intimidate Carlos Ghosn into confessing.  This is what this is all about.  Let's break him so that he admits to all of this, then he can get out.  All he wants is a fair trial.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where is the -- where is the global outrage about this?  About any CEO, whether it's one in the United States or in any other nation that does business in Japan being outraged?  Their -- the backs of their heads should be blowing off in rage, quite frankly.  The fact that -- I mean, what does this say about the abuse of people, of non -- of the non-Japanese?  And I pointed out, this is a cultural problem, it's not just a problem with the judiciary system.  It's that Carlos Ghosn and his family are targets because they're gaijin, they're non-Japanese.  What -- how is it possible in a developed nation that you have a prosecutor that follows the wife of someone who is under arrest into a bathroom?  Does a body search of that individual and then stands in the bathroom when the wife showers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, this is almost beyond comprehension.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's barbaric, and that is what it is, barbaric.  And I -- and this is something else that I heard, insiders told me that now there's a fight or -- going on between the Prime Minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  Apparently, the prime minister's office has been saying why would we re-arrest him?  This is going to be a stain on Japan.  But the prosecutor's office is feeling like this is my -- you know, this is my situation, and I want Carlos Ghosn to admit this, and they went forward.  But there is a bit of, you know, back and forth between the Prime Minister's Office and the Prosecutor's Office.  They have different takes on how to proceed.</p><p>And I think it's because of what you just mentioned, the global reaction to this.  Where are the global investors, where are the global CEOs to say, this is wrong, stop this treatment of Carlos Ghosn, particularly since over the years he's been hailed as a superman for rescuing Nissan?  He was a comic book character.  They've written books about him and stories about him, about what a strong and leadership position he has taken on in this company.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And we'll see.  I mean, eventually, this will get tried.  There will be a public disclosure, a lot of which there hasn't been to this point.  So, we'll see if they can make a case.  But I think in the meantime, to kind of reassure people, especially people looking to do business in Japan, they might -- prosecutors might start by explaining what they're doing.  I think to someone looking at it from afar, you don't even understand the possible reason for this shower episode.  What -- I mean, what is the justification and what is the reason, what is the theory that requires this kind of intrusion into, again, a relative of the accused, not the accused?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm guessing -- I'm guessing, they're trying to put more pressure on him to cut a deal.  Again, then with 99 percent conviction rate, number one.  And number two, they're trying to make sure that his story doesn't get out to the world media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking phones away.  They're putting -- they're intimidating his wife.  They're trying to make sure that the rest of the world doesn't find out what is going in -- going on within the Japanese judicial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Which is why they started -- rumors were circulating that he was going to be rearrested yesterday before they actually showed up at the House because he was talking about giving a press conference on April 11th.  And I'm sure that because I was communicating with them through the wife's phone, they probably had her phone tapped because it's too coincidental that they show up right before we were about to go on air.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's always a why now, why was he rearrested then at that moment, that's the why now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll keep following this, obviously.  We want some answers from the prosecutor's office and we want to actually understand why a female prosecutor had to stay in the shower when Carole Ghosn was taking a shower and be in the bathroom when she was in the bathroom.  What is going on in Japan?  We're going to cover it here.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal has done incredible reporting on this this morning as well.  A preliminary report on the Ethiopian plane crash, meanwhile, is taking aim at Boeing.  Cheryl Casone with that story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting that breaking news within the last couple of hours, Maria.  This report is critical of Boeing's instructions for the updated 737 Max 8 jets.  It found, and this again is an Ethiopian report, that the Ethiopian jet repeatedly nose-dived before it went down and that the flight crew have performed all procedures that were recommended by Boeing, but were still unable to control the plane which kept nose-diving over and over.  Now, investigators blamed an anti-stall feature on the 737.  That, of course, has been a focus of this global investigation.  The report from the Ethiopians recommends that the flight control system be reviewed by Boeing and that aviation authorities should verify this system before the aircraft is put back into operation.  No real effect on Boeing stock though right now.  It's basically flat in the premarket.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Facebook, they are under fire again.  A cyber security firm has discovered that hundreds of millions of Facebook records were exposed on Amazon's Cloud servers.  The firm says the information included account names, e-mail addresses, and comments, and that all of it can be downloaded by the public.  Now, Facebook says it worked with Amazon to remove the databases once it did learn about the issue.  But now, of course, it's becoming public, the stock as you can see, Facebook up about three-quarters of a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Amazon moving thousands of employees from Seattle to a city that's nearby.  They're planning to relocate the entire worldwide operations division to Bellevue, Washington by 2023.  An Amazon spokesperson says the company is looking forward to bringing more jobs to Bellevue.  And there, Maria, is Amazon in the premarket, slightly lower.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  Let's slip in a short break, then we're talking about China trade.  President Trump met with Chinese -- a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He today after talks proved productive yesterday.  We've got the details next.  Then, a possible retirement retraction, Conor McGregor's cryptic tweet and feud with a fellow MMA fighter may put him back in the octagon, much more ahead on that when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning.  Coming up, Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is with us this morning, along with New Jersey Congressman, House Agriculture Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  \"The Coming Collapse of China\" author, Gordon Chang is here; and former McDonald's CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman Ed Renzi.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big show right here in the next 2-1/2 hours.</p><p>First though, we want to kick this off with U.S.-China trade talks, President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House today.  The Vice Premier met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade representative Robert Lighthizer yesterday.  President Trump is likely to announce a summit between Chinese President Xi later today, that's according to The Wall Street Journal.  Joining me right now is InterDigital President and CEO, Bill Merritt.  And Bill, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>WILLIAM MERRITT, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, INTERDIGITAL:  Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  You're doing a lot of business in China.</p><p>MERRITT:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that.</p><p>MERRITT:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has that been for you?  Has the trade issues gotten in the way?</p><p>MERRITT:  Actually, I would say the trade issues have been very helpful to us.  I mean, the focus of the Trump administration on protection of intellectual property, we're a company that has 20,000 patents, covering wireless technology, and we've been trying to license in China for years, and we've given them this very stark fact, we've got 95 percent of the non-Chinese manufacturers under license, paying us more or less (INAUDIBLE) billions of dollars.  We don't have a single Chinese manufacturer under license today.  So, that's the focus by the administration on enforcing I.P., creating benchmarks to show that they're complying with I.P. has been actually very good for us.  And we -- you know, we're cheering them on in what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you've seen firsthand then, the theft of I.P.  Tell us about that.  I mean, how significant is it?  What kind of a cost do you see as it impacts your company, and do you think you're really going to be able to see I.P. theft go away, or is that a cultural thing in China?</p><p>MERRITT:  I don't think it's long-term cultural.  It has been.  I think it can change with enforcement.  You know, in terms of the impact, if you think about what we do and others in our industry do, we hand over the technology to the industry, to build phones, and the return is we then get licensed under the patents that cover that technology.  The impact has been when -- with the Chinese companies not paying royalties to us, they have extra money now to invest in research that we don't have.  And the impact has been in 5G.  They have got tons of money to invest in 5G while research companies like us don't have that money.  And it's creating this imbalance in the research environment for 5G.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  So -- well, so as you look at a Huawei or a ZTE product, do you say, hey, that's looks a lot like our stuff in there?  Or, I mean, how are they doing it without licensing?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, it's an open standard in the sense.  We contribute our technology to the standard, anybody can get it, anybody can build a phone.  So, any phone that's built, we know has our technology in it.  How do they get away with not paying royalties?  They simply just refuse to pay.  They hold out.  You know, a company like ZTE, we've been in litigation with ZTE for almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So, they owe you, they just don't pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're still in litigation?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, in terms of -- we have this I.P. theft, that's one thing.  But in China, there are no regulations in terms of workplace, labor, minimum wage.  How can we even level this playing field at all?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes, I think there's a lot of issues that go into leveling the playing field, right?  And there are some are within our ability, and others are not.  So, you know, things like intellectual property, certainly, there's ways to level that.  There's ways to level all these things, and I think President Trump tweeted a while back about 6G, and telling Americans, you have to compete with other people.  We're not going to just keep people out of the market.  We agree with that.  But compete on a level playing field, and I think he's doing a fantastic job at creating that level playing field as best we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of enforcement action do you think is possible to get the Chinese to keep their promise that they're not going to steal I.P.?  I mean, we're taking a look at Huawei a lot in terms of Huawei stealing trade secrets from Cisco, Motorola Solutions, you know, T-Mobile, et cetera.  So, what do you think it's going to take to get them to keep their promises that they won't steal?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, I think -- I think it's three things: first is a firm commitment from them; the second is the benchmarks, the benchmarks would be concrete activity, signing a certain number of license agreements are things that can be actually measured; and the third is some level of enforcement beyond that.  If those benchmarks are not met, I think that they will work to change what has been a difficult culture in time over time, but you have to work to change that culture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>MERRITT:  I appreciate all of your time.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Merritt there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning, the New York Post is reporting Uber spent $2 million to help push through congestion pricing.  Uber officials say that they're proud of their role in helping pass -- helping to pass the controversial plan to charge drivers a fee for entering Manhattan below 61st Street.  Roughly $1 million paid to some of the top city lobbyists, another 700,000 going to the Fix Our Transit coalition's ad campaign.</p><p>The Chicago Sun Times says Democratic socialists now control one-tenth of the Chicago City council.  Three Democratic socialists winning spots on the 50-seat council in Tuesday's elections.  They will join two others who won back in February.</p><p>And the L.A. Times this morning writes this, Disney shows off Fox titles to cinema owners as a new era takes shape.  Disney delivering a presentation at CinemaCon yesterday, kicking things off with a sizzle reel from several Fox films before showing off new footage from \"Aladdin\" and the \"Lion King.\"  Walt Disney Studio Chairman Alan Horn said that Disney would continue to support an exclusive theatrical release before making movies available at home.  Good stories there this morning.</p><p>But I want to get back to Bill Merritt that we were just talking about.  He made a really good point, as he was leaving, and that is, the Chinese discussions with the United States have taken a new form after the Mueller report was released and the fact that there was no collusion.  Because now the Chinese are saying to themselves, OK, we are looking long term, but now we might have to deal with this guy for eight years.  There's no collusion, he may very well win again, re-election.  So, it just tells you how the talks may very well have taken on a different tone given the U.S. an advantage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wanted to point out a story that's in the Wall Street Journal, too, that talks about -- looks like President Trump is going to announce the -- at least when that summit will take place on Thursday, that's the goal.  But that the United States is part of the enforcement mechanism, wants to keep these punitive tariffs in place.  We will leave the tariffs in place until you prove that you are abiding by this agreement, and that is the sticking point with the Chinese.  But I mean, tariffs on 200 -- you know, a quarter of a trillion dollars in imports in the United States, that's a very, very powerful enforcement mechanism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is poised to leave the tariffs in place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And so, that's -- that seems to be because China wants them kind of date certain for them lifting those tariffs.  And by the way, there are $110 billion worth of U.S. goods that have retaliatory tariffs slapped on them.  So, it's been a drag for the economy.  Certainly not a knockout punch, but a drag.  We'll see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, this whole Mueller report actually is a factor as well.  And the point that I was making was, can you imagine how irresponsible the media and the Democrats have been over the last two years by talking about things like treason, you know, this President committed all of these crimes for two years, it gave the Chinese this upper hand to think that they could actually have their way, that maybe this President is on his way out.  Now, that the Mueller report is out, and it's clear that there's no collusion, they're thinking, well, maybe we have to deal with him for eight years, we better get in line.  That's how irresponsible the last two years have been.  This President is trying to do international deals in North Korea, in China, and they've got the Democrats and the media driving this story, this narrative that never made sense.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So corrosive for people who would not accept the results of the 2016 election.  And we've talked about how investors generally never believed in collusion because you'd see headlines about this alleged conspiracy that put a Kremlin plant in the White House, and markets ignored it.  Essentially had this huge run-up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But that doesn't mean that foreign leaders, especially the nonmarket ones, didn't think maybe this guy is not going to be around, maybe there's something to collusion, and certainly to the extent, they believe it or even suspected it, it weakens his hand across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- and now, you have a whisper campaign that's just beginning, and I want to point out it would -- I'd be remised if I didn't.  The story in the New York Times that they posted yesterday, that people on Mueller's team are sending out signals that wound up on the front page of The New York Times, saying that Bill Barr understated the findings in the Mueller report.  I don't know what the motives are there.  If you read the story, there's really no there, there.  They won't say what it understated, there's no detail.  But again, this is the whisper campaign.  It might be an effort to push this -- the full Mueller report out, and make sure that Barr includes more information in it than he otherwise would.  But again, Robert Mueller is working with Bill Barr to decide what they can release to Congress and ultimately the public.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, first, they won't -- they won't adhere to the results of the 2016 election, now they won't adhere to the results of the special counsel who was godly in their -- in their minds just six months ago, and the attorney general.  You know, Jerry Nadler, the head of judiciary, is calling him a political appointee.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think the New York Times doesn't want to give up the dream, and you wish there was more of an understanding in the media generally that enormous destructive mistakes were made and they're ought to be some reassessment.  But I'm not seeing that at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The New York Times is clearly the aqueduct, carrying water for the people who hate the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And CNN as well.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media and the Democrat Party are one in the same at this point.  You have to just realize.  And they're paying the price for this.  So, there's no collusion.  Now, they're still questioning the report, and next they're saying, we want tax returns from the President.  What's next?  And how is this going to play out?  Not well for the Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  We'll talk about that.  We've got to talk about 2020 because now, Congressman Tim Ryan is going to join the race as well.  We'll take a break, we'll talk about that.  Coming up, more accusations against Vice President Joe Biden after he responds to the initial allegations, what that means for a potential presidential bid.</p><p>More troubles, meanwhile, for Tesla, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in history, as Chief Elon Musk faces off with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

And wrap it up, Mexican food chain celebrating National Burrito Day today, in a big way, offering plenty of discounts and promotions, we've got all those coming up.</p><p>But first, we want to kick this half hour off with Tesla troubles, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in its history.  CEO Elon Musk, meanwhile, is facing off with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, in court, over contempt charges, Dagen on the story, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deliveries, let's clarify that, new vehicle deliveries in the first quarter for Tesla, fell 31 percent from the previous 3 months.  The electric car maker clearly struggling to ship its model 3 compact car to now customers in Europe and China, for the first time.</p><p>This fell came in even below analyst expectations.  That was the biggest drop-off.  We should point out that the first quarter was Tesla's, and so it was 31 percent drop in deliveries.  Last quarter was Tesla's first sales period following the beginning of the phase-out of that important U.S. tax credit.</p><p>So, the tax credit is now $3,750 per car, down from $7,500 for buyers.  That's another concern.  So, Tesla reported two straight quarters of profits, of profitability, it's not likely, based on these numbers, to be profitable in the first quarter.  That was kind of a warning that we got several weeks ago from Elon Musk, anyway.</p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock is doing premarket, before I move on to, well, court, today, for Elon Musk.  It's down 8-1/2 percent in premarket trading, so this delivery shortfall was a surprise and a big one, based on how the stocks moving this morning.</p><p>Meantime, here, in New York, a Federal judge is going to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that's trying to hold CEO Elon Musk in contempt for violating the settlement deal with the SEC.</p><p>This was over these tweets.  The settlement was over these tweets that he sent, funding secured, back in August, and then he was tweeting about how many cars that the company would produce.  He had to amend that tweet earlier this year.  This was in mid-February.</p><p>Here's what's going to happen, probably nothing.  That if the judge sides with the SEC, Elon Musk could get another fine, maybe a big one, limits on his social media use.  He will not get ousted as the CEO of Tesla, mark my words.  You know, it's theoretical, a possibility, but not going to happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Question for you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>ELMORE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not done.  We -- this is this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, in a Manhattan courtroom.  It's not clear if Elon Musk is going to be there.  I would say, not likely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In a Manhattan courtroom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's it.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, I was going to ask you, since he has this agreement with them, and this is a contempt hearing, I think it's likely that he will be found in contempt.  He did violate the settlement from last fall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He argues that he didn't.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He says that the settlement -- that the SEC says in place, that they are trying to enforce it in a way that it does not exist.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they did.  The -- it's -- he is supposed to have people, in the company, review the tweets before they go out.  The tweet was quickly amended and it wasn't off-base, based on things that had been communicated to investors.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm talking about the tweet in February, I think that this is a whole lot of nothing and the SEC doesn't like being called the short seller enrichment commission by Elon Musk.</p><p>So, I think that he has been poking the bear and the bear is clawing back, and I don't think anything significant happens out of this court hearing today, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He likes to poke the bear, the SEC, and he likes to poke the short sellers too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>ELMORE:  And we'd like -- we have to see how aggressive the SEC is going to get today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  What was that, funding secured twitter message that got him in trouble in the first place.  Looks like production not secured either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Hey, let's talk 2020, guys, because new developments here, Joe Biden, first, three more women reportedly accusing the former vice president of inappropriate behavior.  Biden broke his silence and he released a video.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Social norms have begun to change, they've shifted, and boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it.  I get it.  I hear what they're saying.  I understand it.  And I'll be much more mindful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Karl Rove is weighing in this morning in the Journal.  The Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush has a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled this, Don't Count Joe Biden Out.</p><p>Rove writes this, Mr. Biden's subsequent apologies and his promise Wednesday to be more mindful because social norms are changing are acknowledgements that he is struggling in today's Me Too culture.  This reinforces the sense that his first day as presidential candidate will be his best one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I don't know about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As the touchy, feely person on the panel --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll weigh in on this, and I'll get into trouble, but I think it's always been the responsibility of a woman, if a man gets in your space, or another woman gets in your space, then you need to look at him and say, hey bud, you need to have an elbow here, and say, you know what, I'm not that kind of person, don't like, pinch my elbow, don't -- because I'm not that kind of person and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have what I would do, get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have said that to people.  There was a creepy guy who was on air, once, here, it's not anybody working in management or who was on staff, but he started giving me a shoulder rub in the hair room, and I turned around, I was like, you need to put it in reverse, buddy, and back this truck up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back off.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't put your hands on me.  And you know what?  If somebody like Joe Biden, like, put his arm around me, I would just think that that was just a sign of affection --</p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in a very, excuse me, nonsexual way, Southerners are exactly like this, men and women, and I always hate it, because I encountered this in New York, where you would refer to somebody -- when I first started working here as, thanks, hon.</p><p>And then, the person would go around you, and go to management, and complain about you, rather than just looking you in the eye and saying, please, don't address me that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm not your honey.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, that's why -- I</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what I hear you saying is, he shouldn't get bullied out of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just because he smells somebody's hair or kisses them, maybe he shouldn't get bullied by this, even though norms have changed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I find it very --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's no tolerance --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- suspect that these women come out now, and then complain about it publicly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when he's about to declare his run for the Democratic nomination.  People who clearly, one of them, at least, a Bernie Sanders supporter.  That they say it publicly, but never had -- never looked at him and said, you know, and said, I'm not comfortable with this.</p><p>ELMORE:  But speaking of publicly, all of this conduct occurred in public.  No one is alleging anything that wasn't on camera or in front of a big crowd.  No one said things happened behind closed doors or in a bar or in a restaurant or in a hotel or on text.  This was all conduct that occurred in the public eye.  So, what could have really happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, will we be talking about Biden, as a 2020 contender, in six months?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will he be able to get over this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- really quickly, the one thing that he does -- that Karl Rove writes about, which you mentioned, that he needs to stop apologizing.  Remember, Cynthia Nixon called him out for referring to Vice President Mike Pence as being decent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We actually talked about that on the show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he needs to stop apologizing for that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, his only premise as a candidate is that he's going to chart a more moderate course.  So, if he begins his candidacy, if he does become a candidate, and he spends all of this time trying to persuade people that he's just as woke, just as hard left as the other candidates, then there's no point in running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can tell you for sure that Congressman Tim Ryan, from Ohio, will enter the race. He is going to run for the presidency.  So, this question about Joe Biden is opening up a whole new avenue for Tim Ryan.  He could be a force because he's from Ohio, he's a working man's guy, he's not radical left, crazy idea Green New Deal, 70 percent tax rates.  What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this does look like a bet that Biden's not running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But, you know, he's not --Ryan is not that moderate, so that's going to be a question, but definitely, striking a more moderate tone at least.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  They can't beat you on ideas.  They'll try and shut down based on your personality, and I think Joe Biden's feeling that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, moderate relative to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a short break, then we've got to get to Cheryl.  Markets are lower this morning after finishing higher yesterday.  We'll tell you what's moving and we'll tell you the big news of the morning when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new CEO at PG&amp;E.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE:  Maria, good morning again.  PG&amp;E tapping Bill Johnson, he is the current head of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  He will now lead the troubled California utility.  PG&amp;E also announcing a new board as it looks for a way out of bankruptcy.  They face billions of dollars in liabilities for their role in starting deadly wildfires in California.</p><p>Well, severe weather in the south to tell you about, after hitting Texas, a series of thunderstorms is ready to slam other southern states, including Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi.  Large hail and damaging winds expected across the region today.  A few tornadoes could develop.  Forecasters say the system is going to continue to move east tomorrow.</p><p>And finally, Maria, it is National Burrito Day.  Mexican food chains from Chipotle, (INAUDIBLE) are offering deals to celebrate.  And you can be, if you want, a human burrito.  Yep.  Tortilla blankets for babies and adults now viral.  Now, if a burrito isn't your thing, Maria, and I have no idea if it's not, possibly more important, May 5th is National Enchilada Day.  Let's get excited about that.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I really want to wrap up like a burrito.</p><p>CASONE:  Don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, markets this morning seem to be searching for direction, of course we are waiting on news out of the China-U.S. trade talks.  They are close.  I understand that we got a market that is very close to where the indices closed yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon out with this annual letter.  In it he says this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.  Joining us right now the Kadina Group President, Gary B. Smith.  Gary, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see markets today?  Are you still bullish?</p><p>SMITH:  I am getting less bullish, I'm afraid.  You know, the times that we've been together in New York, I think I was very bullish.  Hopefully at the right time.  Now, as we start to get toward those old highs and the fact that volatility has dropped, back to where it was in last October, when there was really nothing on the horizon to bother it, bothers me.  Because it tells me there might be something out there.  We don't know what it is, some black swan event.  Maybe it's in the investigation into Trump's tax returns, maybe it's the whole China thing going south.  I get worried as we approach those old highs, especially as we've gone almost straight up since Christmas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anywhere to hide?  Real quick.  You're expecting a decline in stocks then?</p><p>SMITH:  I think we go to the old highs.  That's another 700 points.  I guess if I was an investor, I'd probably start to take a little off the table, maybe go to 50 percent cash as we get there and kind of wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks for weighing in briefly.  We appreciate it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Spurs' head coach ejected, just 63 seconds into the game.  Jared Max on sports, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Like they say, that escalated quickly.  Gregg Popovich, the first NBA coach in seven years to get kicked out of the game in the opening two minutes, barely lasted one minute -- 63 seconds into the Spurs' eventual loss at Denver.  Pop was gone after being issued a second technical foul.  Maybe something with coach from Texas last night, because the Houston Astros' manager and head coach were both kicked out pitch apart in a loss to the Rangers.</p><p>If you like trying to hit a golf ball through a moving windmill, you are going to want to check out Steph Curry's new venture.  Yes, the Golden State Warrior star is going to become the executive producer and resident golf pro for a 10-episode series on ABC called \"Holy Moly.\"  (INAUDIBLE) but are going together the best mini golf players to compete on epic course.  Each episode has 12 contestants and $25,000 to the winner for each show.</p><p>What was it?  Eight days ago?  We told you that that ultimate fighting champ star, Conor McGregor, said he was retiring and now we suspected that it probably wouldn't the case.  Well, last night, Conor McGregor pretty said he's unretiring, on the same day where had exchanged nasty tweets with fight rival, Khabib Nurmagomedov.  Conor wrote on Twitter: \"I want to move forward with my fans of all faiths and backgrounds.  All faiths challenge us to be our best selves.  It's one world and one for all.  And now, we see you in the Octagon.\"  So, he's going back.</p><p>And the queen of country is about to be the queen of the racetrack.  Check this out!  Dolly Parton is sponsoring her own race car driver.  Tyler Reddick is going to speed off in the pink Chevy Camaro at a race this weekend.  The Xfinity Series on Saturday in Dolly's home state of Tennessee in Bristol.  Dolly Parton on a race, Maria.  How cool is that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Do you know anything about that, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Xfinity race, which is on Saturday, and it's at Bristol motor speedway's thunder dome.  It's the greatest racetrack in racing, so everything should watch it and everybody loves Dolly, everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I like that pink car.  Thank you, Jared.  Jared's sports reports are on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.  Still ahead, the Patagonia power suit no more; why you'll no longer see the iconic clothing brand at some top tech and finance companies?  Right here, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Investors are waiting on any news out of the China trade talks.  The president will meet with China's top negotiator at the White House this afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are lower but just by a fraction.  Dow Industrials down four points, S&amp;P down 2-1/4, NASDAQ down 16.  This after the markets were a little changed yesterday as well.  The NASDAQ was the top performer.  It was up two-thirds of one percent, 46 points higher.  The DowIndustrials were up 39 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.  In Europe this morning, the major indices are mostly lower.  The FT-100 is down 38 points, half a percent.</p><p>The CAC Quarante in Paris is down 17.  The DAX is higher, although well off the highs of the morning.  We did have had weaker-than-expected factory orders data out, and the GDP forecast, for ItalyGermany this morning, were downgraded.  In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, as you can see there: Shanghai was the performer, China up almost one percent.  Startling new details this morning.  The Ethiopian Airlines crash; preliminary results of the investigation blamed Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.</p><p>Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO last night, 10 agents walked into his house and took him away in a car.  We've got full details this morning.  Now, the interrogation has moved to his wife.  They would not leave her alone last night; she could not go to the ladies' room alone.  She said she had to go to the bathroom, an agent left the door open, and waited right there while she was in the bathed.  She wanted to take a shower, a female agent stayed in the shower while she took a shower.</p><p>It's pretty extraordinary what's going on.  He is now back behind bars.  And, by the way, an update for you, prosecutors will not tell his lawyers why he was rearrested.  We don't know.  Google's voice assistant is getting some celebrity help.  Find out who's lending their voice.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman; and Republican Strategist Erin Elmore.  Good to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this Ghosn story is just incredible, in my view.  I don't know that it hampered any foreign investment into Japan, but you have to question the judicial system in Japan throwing somebody in jail without having his say or his chance, to explain himself.  Just to be clear, he says he's innocent and that this was a coup, as I've been reporting for a hundred days now, that the people at Nissan teamed up with the Ministers of Industry to take him down so that Renault would not acquire Nissan.  Pretty extraordinary stuff.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  This is the fourth time he's been re-arrested since December, which is very unusual in the Japanese legal system, which also has a 99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, this is all about squeezing Carlos Ghosn so much, so he admits to crimes that he did not do.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, they'll get to make their case but obviously, the Japanese executives did not want this European control of the business.  And you know, we'll see what their case is when they lay it out, but this kind of over the top series of actions, 10 agents, to capture Carlos Ghosn, as if he's some sort of -- you know -- crime -- chieftain, who's going to be fighting with them and they need 10 guys to restrain him.  The bathroom sequence with his wife, you mentioned, it just -- it's a series of things that make you wonder: what is the point here other than to intimidate as opposed to search for justice?  Well, eventually, we'll get to hear his side of the story, he was going to give his side to you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he was.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He wanted to then later have a larger press conference.  This seems to have disrupted that and we've learned with the Japanese legal system, they may be able to keep him in jail quite a while now without being able to talk further to his attorneys -- very different from United States.  I think we're all eager to finally hear his unfiltered account of events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, and just to be clear, I did speak with Carlos Ghosn last week.  And he says that this was a coup, his number two was afraid that he was going to get fired because the company was simply not doing well.  And they had missed expectations, and revenue declines for four straight quarters, and he was getting ready to announce some consolidation.  He said, he was not going to announce an out-and-out merger with Renault, but he was certainly going to make some big changes, and they didn't like that.</p><p>And so, they lured him to Japan, and they he arrested him with the help of the minister of industry in Japan.  I'm hearing now that there is a back-and-forth between prime minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  The prime minister's office did not want him rearrested.  They thought -- he thought that this would be a stain on Japan, but the prosecutor went ahead and did it.  10 agents showing up last night, like I said, right before we were about to do an interview, which leads me to question whether or not her phone is tapped as well.</p><p>We know that he has a government phone, the lawyer gave him the phone to use, while he was in this apartment in Tokyo.  But you know, I had been communicating with her, and her phone must be tapped. So, they showed up right before the interview to shut him down.  They don't want him giving a press conference either; he said he wanted a press conference on April 11th.  They don't want the news out; they don't want to hear his plea for innocence.  So, there you go you go.</p><p>We'll follow that.  Meanwhile, there is trouble for Tesla this morning.  The stock is sliding nearly 10 percent, following weak deliver numbers.  This is coming ahead of Elon Musk's SEC battle.  He's headed to the SEC in court with him today.  The stock is down 10 percent, as you can see.  Kristina Partsinevelos is outside the court house.  She's in downtown New York City.  And Kristina, are you expecting to see Elon Musk today?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  No, it seems like the rumor is that he probably won't show up, but you never know in these types of situations.  The SEC. the Security Exchange Commission will be debating here behind me against Elon Musk.  They're going to be squaring off at 2:00 p.m. time.  They're going to be giving their oral arguments which have already been received by the judge.  And what are they debating?  They are debating whether Elon Musk is in contempt for a tweet, that he sent out on February 19.</p><p>This tweet reads: \"Tesla made zero cars in 2011, but we'll make around 500,000 in 2019.\"  This tweet was later updated.  However, the SEC arguing that Musk infringed on his settlement with the SEC for a previous tweet in August where misled investors that he was going to take the company private.  What we know from that settlement is that he had to pay $20 million; Tesla had to pays $20 million.  He had to step down as chairman for three years, and he had to get his tweets preapproved.  And that's the major debate today.</p><p>Musk, though, his legal team, are saying in his defense, two reasons.  First, one, that his tweet on February 19th was a not material.  All of that information about production rate was already in the earnings report, was already discussed on conference call.  The second point is that all of this infringed on Elon Musk's freedom of speech.  This is going to be debated, Maria, today at 2:00 p.m.  The judge is -- according to legal experts we spoke to, not likely to come to a decision today, but could side with SEC, could side with Elon Musk, or scrap out the settlement altogether and start back at zero.  So, we'll find out around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  All right, Kristina, we'll be watching you all day today, ahead of that.  Kristina Partsinevelos in New York.  Meanwhile, we're going to turn to U.S.-China trade.  President Trump just tweeted moments ago he says this: \"Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the economy is looking very strong, and China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely.  There is little or no inflation and USA optimism is very high.\"  President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House.</p><p>The president is likely to announce as summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later today, according to the Wall Street Journal.  We are expecting that to be either later April or early May.  Joining me right now is the Author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang.  And Gordon, it's always a pleasure to see you.  First, let's talk about the trade deal, what are you expecting in terms of the main tenants of any deal?  Do you think we'll get to a deal between the U.S. and China?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR:  Well, everyone says there will be a deal that they've settled 90 percent of the points.  I'm not so sure that we're going to hear a deal announced in next day or so, you know, but next couple of months.  The question, though, is you know we've had a decades of failed trade agreements with China.  The question is do you remedy that with another deal?  So, we'll see how this goes, but, clearly, you know, this is heading in that direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks like the Chinese are willing to open up its markets, they're opening up the markets to financial services companies in the U.S. among other industries, and they're willing to buy more commodities.  What about the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, that's the real (INAUDIBLE) of the problem.  You know, people say: well, look, we're close to a deal, but they have not yet decided on the enforcement mechanisms that can get China to agree to.  And so, that is really going to be the critical thing.  And if President Trump doesn't agree to tough enforcement mechanisms, then clearly, this is not going to be a good deal for us.  But if there are tough enforcement mechanisms, Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler has a lot of incentive to say \"no,\" because they're building up this narrative of national humiliation in China.  And whenever they start talking about that, that's not a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Huawei.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, announcing it is ending collaborations with, and ZTE over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions.  MIT also said it's reviewing the school's collaborations with China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.  This is really getting dicey around Huawei.  I've spoken with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this.  He's trying to tell the Europeans: Look, you know, if you're going to use Huawei telecom, we're going to not share as much information with you.  This is high stakes on Huawei.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, it certainly is.  You know, and one of the arguments that the United States has been making is that, that the 2017 national intelligence law in China requires Chinese parties to spy on others if China demands it.  And certainly, you know, we've seen Huawei spy on the African Union, they did that for 12 -- for five years.  And so, clearly, there's a strong case there, but, you know, Huawei is really supported by the Chinese Diplomatic Corps.  Beijing has gotten behind this company, and that really should tell us a lot because this is a geopolitical issue for China, not just an economic one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you do think that the president will be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism?  Should the Chinese not keep up their promises, not to steal from United States if there is more stealing of I.P., they snap back more tariffs, or what?  What is the enforcement mechanism to get Beijing to keep the promises?</p><p>CHANG:  They're going to keep some tariffs on, and President Trump has been very clear about that for last month.  So, that looks like going it's to be the case.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.</p><p>CHANG:  And the Chinese have been saying: look, that's unacceptable to them.  Now, I don't know where the middle ground here is -- you know, but clearly, this is where we either have a trade deal or we don't have one.  And I sort of think that, you know, it's up to the president to just sort of increase the tariffs until the Chinese stop stealing our I.P.  Because, really, you know, we've had agreements with China and very detailed agreements with China, and they have just dishonored all them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, like the time they said they were going to buy all those beefs, and then they never bought the beef.  I got to get your take on swine flu outbreak in China.  China is not talking about this at all.  But I was talking to an American businessman last night and he was telling me that China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  And right now, 20 percent of the pigs are diseased with swine flu.  So, they are dying -- 20 percent of the pigs in China means that is a 100 million dead pigs.  What are they going to do with a 100 million dead pigs?  How do you dispose of 100 million dead pigs?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, in previous instances like this, they just dump them in the river.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly!  But they can't dump 100 million dead pigs in the river, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, there's going to be a lot of burning of pigs and the rest of it.  The issue here for the United States is that China has agreed to buy more soybeans, but with fewer pigs, they're not going to need soybeans as much as, you know, had anticipated.  So, this is going to be another one of those difficult issues between China and U.S.  Do they actually buy commodities in the amounts agreed?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Earlier, I spoke with New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew about this very issue.  Watch what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D), NEW JERSEY:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher.  There's no question -- when you're going to have a shortage of meat, and you're going to certainly going have a shortage of pork, and the prices are going up -- number one.  Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God, we have got a good Department of Ags to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the source that I was talking to last night said it's not just pork prices that are going up, it's going to ripple throughout meat.  It will go chicken prices, and meat prices as well, what do you think?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, certainly, because, you know, pork is such an important staple in China.  If you don't have it, you're going to have to eat something else.  And so, this is going to affect prices in Asia, and which means it's going to affect prices here.  It's going to have a knock-on effect, as I mentioned on soybeans and other commodities.  So, this is going to be felt worldwide.  Because I'm actually surprised that it's only 50 percent of the world's pork.  I think that it's actually higher --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's more than 50 percent.</p><p>CHANG:  I thought so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  How come nobody talking about the swine flu?  You don't see this reported anywhere?  I mean, I didn't.</p><p>CHANG:  This -- there was a little bit of reporting about two weeks ago, because the U.S. Department of Agriculture confiscated Chinese pork coming into U.S., which was diseased.  And so, that obviously was important to the A.G. markets here.  But you're right, for the most part, this is a story which no one is really talking about, and it does have effect through both the markets and the trade talks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm glad that we discussed it.  Gordon, it's good to see you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That you so much.  Gordon Chang joining us.  Coming up, startling new developments in the case against Boeing.  The very latest on the Ethiopian Airlines crash investigation, that's next.  And then, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars -- I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last night, and as we were about to start the call, 10 agents walked in, took him away.  More on the story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The 737 Max jet, the crash in Ethiopia last month reportedly had a damaged sensor.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Learning some new things here, Maria.  The angle of an attack sensor on the Boeing 737 Max was reportedly damaged during takeoff, by a foreign object or a bird.  That is according to ABC News right now.  Sources are saying that the sensor then sent false readings to the plane's anti-stall system, as the pilots tried desperately to keep it from pushing the plane nose down.  Meanwhile, the preliminary report on the crash from the Ethiopian government that came out this morning, is taking aim at Boeing, finding that the Ethiopian jet apparently nose-dived before it went down and the flight crew performed, according to this report, all the procedures recommended by Boeing, but still could not control that plane.</p><p>Well, Target raising its minimum wage.  The retailer announcing workers are going to now earn $13.00 an hour.  This starts in June, that is up from $12.00.  The move coming as retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers.  Target employs over 300,000 people right now.</p><p>Well, Google Assistant launching its first celebrity voice today, and here you go, it starts with singer, John legend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LEGEND, SINGER:  Whoa.  I am feeling this new voice.  You can find me on all kinds of devices: phones, Google Home, and if I'm lucky, in your heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER).</p><p>CASONE:  You bet, you John!  The musician is going to give you the weather, maybe sing you happy birthday, tell you a joke.  This voice is only available for a limited time unfortunately.  Google says, there are going to be some more celebrity cameos, thanks to approve voice synthesizing technology.  I would love a little happy birthday from John Legend.  Bring it on!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that, yes!  Which celebrity voice do you guys want on your Google devices?  James, what about you?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I guess I'd go with Sinatra, If I had --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one, good one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I would like Dolly Parton, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I'll go with Dolly.</p><p>ELMORE:  She's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Was I fortunate to meet her in the green room in this building a couple of years ago.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's a doll, huh!</p><p>FREEMAN:  She is just as wonderful, as you always hear about.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good to wake up with a voice like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but when she comes in -- she comes in, I don't care what time of day it is, Dolly Parton is always extremely professional.  And she looks you in the eye.  I think of -- like a lot of people can learn from that.  She's incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's real deal.  And now, she's going to the racetrack.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly, you got to watch Dolly.  I mean, she can dust anybody.  That's been clear with her long career.  But anyway, I'll do like, Gilbert Godfrey.  Remember Geico -- that was not Geico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The duck --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, the duck -- the duck fired him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'd be a good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would take Gilbert Godfrey.  Not just because it'll make you pay attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break, coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO when he was arrested again last night, the full story coming up.  Then, privacy alert; Facebook leaving hundreds of millions of user data exposed on public Amazon servers.  How the company is resolving that problem?  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are quiet this morning pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are waiting on any news out of the U.S.-China trade talks.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter this morning, writing this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade, but they are manageable.\"  He calls the U.S. trade issues China substantial and real.</p><p>Want to talk about, Jamie Dimon's letter and really the issues around China.  He's right, and of course, business wants to get into China, and wants the Chinese to open up its markets so that American businesses can sell to the 1.4 billion people.  That's one of the items on the list.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, and the question is, do they mean it this time?  Because what the messages out of China, the formal statements, the new policies, new laws, they -- they have -- announced within the last few months, are all about solving this problem.  Now, the question is are they going to mean it this time?  Are they actually going to allow U.S. businesses to operate there in a -- fair manner?  And we'll see when this trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's just one of several elements.  You've also got China buying more commodities from the U.S., and of course the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, and the forced transfer of technology, Erin.</p><p>ELMORE:  Jamie Dimon is optimistic about China, but there are true concerns there, not just trade and soybeans.  This is about a lot more.  There are copyright infringement I.P. laws, there are no regulations in terms of business, there are no labor laws, there's no minimum wage.  They don't care about pollution.  So, there's a whole lot of issues going on in China, that are a lot bigger than, I think, people are getting credit for and there are concerns going into China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the president ought to really think about taking off the tariffs if he gets the deal he wants.  Because if you leave the tariffs in place, pending a check of China's behavior in the future, what did we really accomplish here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not getting the deal that he wants because it seems like he is willing to keep some tariffs in place.  I mean, that -- it seems like that's where this is going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is, clearly.  The steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place and you're worried about the state of the U.S. auto industry -- well, you just drove up their costs by billions of dollars, and you're still basically putting a thumb down on our auto industry and our manufactures, and trying to blame somebody else for it.  That's not -- that tariffs probably won't go away anytime soon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which means that this drag on our economy may not be relieved by a deal if there's no relief from the essentially taxes on consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though, the economy seems to be holding up strongly in the face of weakness across the world.  The unemployment numbers will be out tomorrow.  We've got our jobs Friday tomorrow.  Joining us to preview that and talk about, investing today is Federated Investor Senior Equity Strategist, Linda Duessel.  Linda, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for weighing in here.  First, the employment, the jobs number tomorrow; how much is priced into the market, what are you expecting from the jobs' report out tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern?  We're expected to see the unemployment rate hold steady at 3.8 percent with 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of March.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTOR:  Well, it's a fully employed economy.  It doesn't seem to me that we should worry about it being too hot or even too cold.  So, that should really not be a market moving event, I wouldn't think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is going to drive markets then?  How are you positioning clients?  Do you want to buy stocks here or pull back?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, we're bullish on the market.  We think the S&amp;P finishes the at 3100, and -- you know, that's based on just a reasonable earnings growth rate and the market deciding by the end of the year that actually, there's not an inflation problem, the fed could stay at bay for some time and we don't have to worry about unemployment rising dramatically and a recession on pace.  However, we just ran too fast.  Too fast on the way down last year the end, and too quickly on the way up this year.  The bull, which we are, would like nice a consolidation in here.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good morning, Linda, Erin Elmore here.  Born and raised in Pittsburgh, so love your great city.  But given this period of low volatility, it looks like Fed isn't going to raise interest rates anytime soon.  What sectors, do you think, are still undervalued, that you think have an opportunity for a run-up?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, you know, we like growth, we believe it's a back half of the cycle, and so that would mean, you want to get growth, you want to get more reliable growth.  We really think that ought to have some have balance in your portfolio, because as we all know, there are a number of worries about trade around the globe, worries about China maybe falling into recession, worry about our own upcoming political season now, and what that might mean for the earnings outlooks.  A lot of exposure out there, the binary evens that we don't know how they'll work out.  And so, we think everybody ought to have some balance to their portfolio.  And that means, really, the high-quality dividend paid stocks.  I like it very much for income; they are not expensive right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, real quick before you go.  We've got the calendar one first-quarter earnings coming out beginning on Friday, with the banks, the 12th.  Would you put money to work in those areas ahead of earnings or are you expecting a tough earnings period here?  Real quick, Linda.</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, I think that the earnings season to be tough in Q1 is already understood.  Nobody cares about that as much as the outlook into the next quarter and rest of the year, and financial is really looking expensive to us, and that's one of our over weights.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We leave it there.  Linda, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Linda Duessel joining us there from Federated.  Don't miss our \"Jobs in America\" special tomorrow morning.  It kicks off 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We are identifying where the jobs are in this economy right now, all hands-on deck for jobs in America tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m. right here.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting on the Mueller investigation.  Here's what he just said: \"According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian collusion hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive.  They should focus on legislation, or even better in investigation of how ridiculous collusion delusion got started.  So illegal,\" writes the president.</p><p>A quick break and then coming up next, the border battle: President Trump is preparing to visit southern border in California tomorrow as he eases back on the shutdown threats.  The economic impact of an immigration debate, next.  And then Facebook is under fire again; the networking giant leaving hundreds of millions of users' data exposed.  The company's efforts to fix the breach, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 4th.  Your top stories right now 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are searching for direction this morning, take a look, Dow Industrials now up 18 points, the S&amp;P 500 exactly where it closed yesterday, and the NASDAQ down 10 points right now.  Investors are waiting on some news out of the China trade talks, and they are thinking that it could be good news, and it looks like the two are very disclose.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, and we do see weakness there.  FT-100 down 37 points, a half of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 12, but the DAX Index is up 26 points, even though we did get weaker-than-expected economic data, factory orders down on -- in Germany this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, with the exception of Hong Kong, as you can see.</p><p>Well, he is back behind bars, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn was rearrested last night moments before I was about to start an exclusive interview with him on the telephone.  The very latest coming up.  Privacy alert, Facebook reportedly leaving the data of millions of users exposed on Amazon servers.  How the company hopes to fix it.  Then the state of the housing market, it is getting a boost due to falling mortgage rates.  We take a closer look there later this hour.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the battle at the border.  President Trump headed to California, the California border tomorrow, as he eases back on the threat to shutdown border operations, this comes as Mexican officials are warning of port of entry delays, that's causing tens of millions of dollars in business losses.  Joining us now is the former CEO of McDonald's, former Famous Dave's Barbecue CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman, Ed Rensi.  Ed, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL:  Good morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As a business guy, what is the impact of the border closing?  Give us the news.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be significant.  I think Trump is using this as a negotiating ploy, frankly, because the impact would be staggering.  You know, you're talking about $12 billion worth of just food and produce coming across that border annually.  You look at all the car parts, medical supplies, and things of that nature, it's going to impact a lot of businesses in the United States.  I know they're working right now to try to minimize some of that stuff, but the reality is we got a sovereignty issue and our border is being penetrated.  If it were just people looking for an opportunity, that'd be one thing, but we got a lot of bad characters coming into this country and it's dangerous and we need to protect ourselves.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ed, hi.  James Freeman here at The Wall Street Journal, and kudos on naming your company FAT Brands.  Very strong.  I -- I'm wondering, as far as the -- that impact on the food service industry that you obviously focus on, we saw the news on avocados, the potential for the supply to run out within a few weeks if the Mexican imports are cut off, it goes beyond avocados and, you know, sort of millennial avocado toast jokes aside, how would the average diner notice?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, you're going to see shortages, and there'll be some things taken off the menu because you just can't get the product, whether it's avocados, or tomatoes, or whatever, these crops are going to come out of the ground and off the trees, and if they're not consumed, they're going to rot.  So, the short-term closing of the border will have a lot of long-term implications so we need to be careful about that.  I'm hopeful that this capitalist system of ours will put enough pressure on everybody in our house of -- the house of -- the Congress and Senate to start dealing with these immigrations issues in a more sensible way.</p><p>I hope it doesn't impact menu pricing, I hope it doesn't impact our ability to make money in restaurants, but it's going to be very, very difficult, to say the least, if that border closes.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  Good morning.  Erin Elmore here.  So shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to ask you about Chick-fil-A.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but two liberal cities just banned them from their airports -- San Antonio and Buffalo, given some of their social stances.  What's your take there and what advice would you give them?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, this country was founded on religious tolerance for a lot of great reasons and we have to respect each other and agree to disagree.  I get a little bit concerned when we're so intolerant about everything that we can't find common ground to solve problems and move forward.  I'm not going comment on what San Antonio does or what Chick-fil-A believes in, we all get to be who we are in this country and that's one of the great things in this country.  And I think some of these issues have taken on a preponderance of weight that's scary in a lot of ways and I hope they get it resolved sensibly and intelligently.  I think that we all, as citizens in this country, ought to have the right to exist and have a happy life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tell that to some of the academics out there, huh?  Ed, let me ask you about the minimum wage.  Target, the latest company to raise its minimum wage.  Employees going to now receive $13.00 an hour, a dollar increase from their last rates, which was, by the way, March of 2018.  The raise coming after --</p><p>RENSI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blew up Twitter over the minimum wage issue, comparing it to a $7.00 croissant.  Here's what she said, \"Croissants at LaGuardia are going for $7.00 apiece, yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal dedicated human labor for $15.00 is too expensive.\"  She tweeted it on April Fools' Day but it was no joke.  Your reaction.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I wouldn't pay $7.00 for a croissant no matter where --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are not going to buy.</p><p>RENSI:  - I bought it, whether it's Paris or anywhere else, but the reality of it is she's making a statement about the value of workers and the value of products, and I don't disagree.  I think the best system is a capitalist system that allows all wages to seek a market level, and I think Target's move is simply a reflection of the fact that we're near full-employment, and it is extremely difficult to get employees to work.  I've talked to multiple -- I had dinner with a bunch of McDonald's franchisees the other night, and they are struggling to find employees at any price.  I see some of them are $16.00, $17.00 an hour and still can't find employees.  So, let the free market determine the wage, and don't buy $7.00 croissants.  That's a bad idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, time and again, Ed, it's Dagen McDowell, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complains about the Flint water crisis.  She -- she's upset about children having asthma in the South Bronx, she's upset about a $7.00 croissant.  I'm not saying that those are on the same level of rage from her.  However, she points to where the government fails the citizens, where the government is the problem, not the solution.  Whether it's the City of New York --</p><p>RENSI:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a socialist city --</p><p>ELMORE:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- doesn't take care of its residents, can't basically help children with asthma despite a fully socialized medical system in this city, or the $7.00 croissant at LaGuardia.  Again, those rents are high because it's essentially controlled by the government.</p><p>RENSI:  A government is extremely inefficient and they ought to get out of business altogether.  You look at the Housing Authority in New York City and tens of thousands of apartments that have lead paint in them, ceilings falling down, no boilers, government is inefficient, and de Blasio is grossly underperforming what his responsibilities are.  And look at that Flint water crisis, they know what the solution is.  They need to put phosphate in the water to trap all lead, they need to get rid of all the lead pipes, they have had multiple millions of dollars spent, it's grossly inefficient, and they're not solving the problem.  I don't get it.  They ought to about thrown out in the next election, all of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Ed, let me -- let me end on this China story, because Cornerstone Macro, which I think is one of the best research shops out there, is talking about the reports yesterday that -- are talking about a deal between the U.S. and China, which would give Beijing until 2025 to meet the commitments on commodity purchases and allow U.S. firms to wholly own enterprises in China.  They think it's a weak deal and they think that this deal is a deal that Robert Lighthizer is likely to oppose privately.  It could happen because Trump wants a deal but there's a real chance they say it does not happen, because this is a weak deal.  What do you think?  Do you think a deal happens with China or not?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I think some kind of deal will likely happen, but if it's not a good deal, there'll be enough public opinion from businesspeople, and institutions of finance, that we'll soon know what the deal really looks like.  I'm very concerned about China because they want to dominate the globe as the number one entity on the planet.  It's dangerous.  They're a totalitarian system of government.  You look at the swine flu problem they've got, they consume a lot of pork, they export a lot of pork, that swine flu epidemic could wipe out their entire pork crop.  They have no means of getting rid of a hundred million hogs, they own one of the largest hog producers in the United States.  Those kinds of issues, and intellectual property theft.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RENSI:  These are really significant issues that are going to impact us for the next hundred years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've been focusing on the swine flu this morning.  You're not hearing that anywhere in the media, a hundred million pigs they have to dispose of, a hundred million dead pigs.  It pretty extraordinary, Ed.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, historically, what they have done is they dumped them in the river --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RENSI:  -- dumped them in the ocean and let God take them away, that's not going to work anymore because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>RENSI:  -- the numbers are too staggering.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a hundred million.</p><p>RENSI:  But it point -- it points out this extreme weakness of a government that functions the way they function.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ed, good to see you.</p><p>RENSI:  That problem is solvable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, Ed.  We will continue the conversation.  Thanks so much.  We will see you soon.  Ed Rensi joining us.  Coming up, home buying heats up, a wave of strong housing data shapes up the market to be the best in years.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last might when 10 agents walked in his house and took him away.  I'll share the full story later this hour.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Hey, guys.  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Volvo open hit top gear in Charleston, South Carolina Wednesday, but it was a mixed day for the red, white, and blue.  Taylor Townsend enjoyed one of the biggest wins of her career, as took out Julia Gorges to reach the third round.  The American closing out the number seven seed in the second set breaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAYLOR TOWNSEND, TENNIS PLAYER:  Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and just really go after it.  I mean I think sometimes you can play a little tentatively, but I just tried to go for it and then whatever happened, happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  The hometown favorite, Shelby Rogers, is out.

I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New mortgages soaring as loan rates hit 15-month lows.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to talk more about that.  Stuart Varney, good to see you, Stu.  Good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  You, too, Maria.  You might call this the stealth stimulus?  Maybe.  You got four percent mortgages, we got the latest mortgage numbers today in about one hour's time, could be still at four percent, as what I'm expecting, and last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association says the refi activity went up 36 percent.  Now that's a real shot in the arm for the housing industry and for real estate generally.  I think it's a shot in the arm for the economy.  If you got four percent mortgages, and what six months, seven months ago, we were talking about five percent mortgages.  I think you've got a drop here and I think that really helps everyone.</p><p>And frankly, I'm surprised at how rate-sensitive people are.  A jump of 36 percent in refi activity just because mortgages go from 4.25 percent down to four percent even?  I didn't realize that people were so rate-sensitive --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- and so pent up with demand to get in at a lower rate, but they are, and I think that's a shot in the arm for everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  And even on this program, Stu, we've heard a couple of people says that there are now green suits in housing because of --</p><p>VARNEY:  Remember that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, from way back when, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're singing it.  We're seeing it and housing, Stu.  I know more you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.  Got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his fantastic panel after the program.  But first, President Trump just tweeted again, he really just said, \"There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy.  This is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country,\" writes the President.  Coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO, he was taken away to the prosecutor's office.  I'm sharing the full story coming up.</p><p>Then privacy alert, Facebook leaves hundreds of millions of users data unprotected.  The company's efforts to fix the situation coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook under fire again, millions of users' information left exposed on a public server.  Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Hey, that's right, Maria.  Amazing story here -- Facebook two-third party Facebook app level first.  Storing user data on Amazon servers in a way that allowed them to be downloaded by the public.  The information hiding in plain sight.  Up guard, a cybersecurity firm making this information public.  The two offenders here, Cultural Collective, this is a Mexico City-based digital platform with 45 million followers.  They openly stored records on 540 million people.</p><p>At the pool, this is a defunct app.  They stored information including names, passwords, e-mail addresses on 22,000, this is the people kind of information that used to be freely available, and Facebook itself has tried to crack down on it.  Meanwhile, Guggenheim has raised its rating to a buy and privacy concerns here remain.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All, right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS:  Welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, we're going to talk about what's going on in Japan.  Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars, I'm going to tell you all about it.  The details, as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the Former CEO last night when he was arrested.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's end where we began the program.  Japanese authorities rearrested former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn facing new chargers, financial misconduct.  He's denying any wrongdoing.  Saying in a statement, \"My arrest this morning is outrageous in arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals to -- at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I'm innocent of these groundless charges and accusations.\"</p><p>It was a dramatic evening.  I was back at work last night at about 5:30 p.m. because we were about to do an exclusive interview.  He was going to call into the show and I was going to bring you that interview this morning.  As we were about to get started, he was calling into the show.  Ten agents burst it into his apartment and put him in a room and talk to him and then took him away.  They then -- they were both still in their pajamas, Carlos and his wife, Carole.  They then were voluntarily forcing Carole Ghosn to answer questions.</p><p>His wife, she said, after the agents left, \"I wanted to use the bathroom.  The officer entered the bathroom with me and did the body check.  They kept the bathroom door open while I used the bathroom.\"  A female prosecutor stayed in the shower with Carole while she showered.  They are trying to break him.  The whole point here is to get Carlos Ghosn to admit to something.  He remains saying he's innocent.  Guys.</p><p>ELMORE:  Japan has a 99 percent conviction rate, so this looks really bad for Ghosn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the prosecution has not presented any evidence, eventually we'll hear it.  We would hope -- well, eventually, we would hope to hear his side of the story as well.  Renault has raised questions about his expenses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK.  So that -- you're saying that Renault did their own investigation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we will keep following this.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  I will.</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 4, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 040402cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Tesla's Troubles; E-Cigarette Crackdown; College Admissions Scandal; Brexit Debate; President Donald Trump to Visit the Border Wall; Interview with Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 4th.</p><p>Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are waiting on any China trade news.  The President will meet with China's top negotiator today at the White House.</p><p>Markets are flat, S&amp;P 500 down a fraction, Dow Jones Industrial average up a fraction.  This after markets were little changed yesterday.  The Nasdaq was the top performer on the day yesterday.  It was up two-thirds of 1 percent, 46 points higher.  The other major indices higher but just fractionally.  Dow Industrials up about 39 points yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the story and it is mixed.  FT 100 down 30 points.  CAC 40 in Paris down 9 points.  But the DAX index in Germany up 26.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher as you can see here with the exception of Hong Kong.</p><p>We are waiting on the jobs report.  It's jobs Friday tomorrow, that may very well be a market mover.</p><p>Cracking down on e-cigarettes.  The FDA is warning of serious health concerns after some users are reporting they're getting seizures after vaping.</p><p>The college admissions scandal continues.  Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman appearing in a Boston court yesterday, after they signed autographs outside.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Plus the vests take over Wall Street.  But now the company behind them, Patagonia, is saying no more.  Wait until you hear that story.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Republican strategist Erin Elmore.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>Jamie Dimon has his annual letter out.  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase out with his annual letter.  And he writes this, \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.</p><p>The letter has become something that Jamie Dimon is real proud of, you know, as he takes a whack at policy issues and talks about concerns for the country, not just JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes.  I think China obviously the big issue on the table.  I think he's speaking for the business community, where they don't like tariffs but they recognize that the game in China is not fair to foreign companies.  It's not fair on intellectual property, et cetera.</p><p>Larger policy points in there, I think some of them are laudable.  But I don't like the idea that businesses have a sort of a social responsibility to advocate for different public policies.  I think the job of a bank, for example, and his bank does it very well, is to fund businesses, allow companies to grow, allow people to have the financial services and I think that's a great service.  You don't need to be involved in public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This reads like a 10-point plan for a man who is running for the nomination of some party.  I don't know which party it is.</p><p>But he talks about infrastructure spending and the infrastructure plan to improve our highways and such.  That is the role of the government, how to pay for it is the question.  Also things like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Education.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- education.  Those are the big l policy issues.  I mean, he's kind of -- again, tell us something we don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He says ten ways to address what's holding back growth and opportunity, education, healthcare costs, regulatory reform, infrastructure, tax system, litigation reform, immigration reform, mortgage reform, labor market, budgeting and planning.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Jamie Dimon, 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, he said he's not going to run.</p><p>ELMORE:  No, no.  Definitely not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's not woke enough, I don't think, to certainly win the Democratic nomination and you already got like a Howard Schultz possibly running as an independent candidate.  I wasn't suggesting that.  I'm just saying it reads like a policy platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  You're absolutely right.  But I will say this, he's probably going to be getting some good news recently -- good news in the near term on China because the Chinese are agreeing to open up their markets, particularly to financial services.</p><p>UBS was the first bank to get an opportunity to own a bank out and out, 51 percent.  But it looks like financial services are going to be the first industry that really gets a shot to sell to the 1.4 billion people in China, which is a big opportunity.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And if you look at what the Chinese have said recently, it sounds like reform.  Obviously, there's this question, and this is sort of the sticking point in the trade negotiations right now, what is the enforcement mechanism?  When do you take the tariffs off?  How do you punish if they're not following the deal.</p><p>I think on the U.S. side, they are convinced that Liu He is a genuine reformer.  He wants to move the Chinese economy toward open markets, the rule of law, respect for property.  Can he sell that to Xi Jinping who is really an old-fashioned communist.  And we'll hear from Gordon Chang who obviously covers this extremely well but covers this extremely well.  But that's really the he question, I think is can He sell that reform opportunity back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm expecting that meeting between the President and Xi Jinping in May, early May, is the guidance that I'm getting in terms of the meeting in Mar-a-Lago -- that must mean reform that they are really down to the final items as we told you yesterday actually.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we've got a great show.</p><p>Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is here.  He'll be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and House agriculture committee member Jeff Van Drew.  We'll get both of their ideas.</p><p>Plus the author of \"The Coming Collapse Of China\", Gordon Chang is with us to talk about where we are in that deal.  And former McDonald's CEO, and Fat Brands international chairman Ed Rensi joining is us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Now to the Securities and Exchange Commission versus Elon Musk, the Tesla chief headed to court today over his controversial tweets that have triggered a legal t battle between his company and the SEC.   A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the agency which is the court to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement.</p><p>Joining us now is ARK investment analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha Keeney.  Tasha it's god to see you.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ARK INVESTMENT ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>Have you been trading or recommending this stock in light of all this -- Tesla?</p><p>KEENEY:  In light of the SEC Investigation?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Keeney:  Well, we know -- we don't try to predict legal outcomes.  We certainly don't know.  But you know, Dagen I heard you say earlier, you don't think that he'll be removed as CEO.  That's really most important to us.  We want him to stay at the helm of the company.  Especially if Tesla is still reaching for autonomy with its vehicles which what we think the largest market opportunity ahead of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Think about the outrage about that, if a federal judge because of a tweet -- a tweet violates a settlement with a securities regulator which has no really criminal authority over companies, it has -- it can file civil cases, having a judge remove a CEO for a tweet ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want to remove President Trump for his lies; for his tweets.</p><p>ELMORE:  And Tasha How do you manage your expectations given the fact that Elon Musk has such volatility in his behavior?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, we look at Musk really as a visionary.  He's accomplished the impossible.  I mean he's changing the face of the auto industry.  So there's a lot of transparency in what he does because he uses Twitter.</p><p>And he has made mistakes in the past and he's admitted those and paid for those mistakes.</p><p>You know, I think, again, for the long term goal of the company in terms of getting to full autonomy, being a leader in electric vehicles, he seems to have a accomplished that.  We're happy so far with how things are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company's new vehicle deliveries plummeted 31 percent in the first quarter.  Tesla is citing challenges associated with taking the Model 3 overseas for the first time.  How are they going to deal with this?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know,  it think there's too much focus on deliveries.  Again, with an innovative company like this you have to look at the long-term picture.  So if Tesla's late by say a month or what have you on those numbers -- I mean, are they -- it's still the best selling mid-size premium sedan.  I mean there's no demand issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: but again but it doers reflect and the \"Wall Street Journal\" writes about this in its analysis today.</p><p>\"Tesla has trouble planning.  And if you're going to be in the manufacturing business, you really need to learn how to cross your t's and dot your i's so-to-speak.  Because Tesla produced 22 percent more cars than it was able to deliver in the first quarter.  This shows in part a logistics problem.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to hurt income --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's more likely but Elon Musk kind -- and Tasha can attack about this.   Elon Musk kind of forecast several weeks ago -- we were talking, remember about the debt payment.  It was really about him saying that the company might not be profitable in the first quarter after two straight quarters of producing a profit because of some of the issues.</p><p>And in part, they are losing that tax credit as well.  It was at $7,500.  Now it's essentially been cut in half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stock is down 8 percent right now.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  Exactly.  So I think -- well, so one, in terms of profitability, I think so Tesla said they have enough cash on-hand at the end of the quarter and I think in general with the delivery figures, I mean, have you to ask yourself, are these logistic challenges going to kill the company?  No.  You know.</p><p>If you're a long-term investor, I don't think this should phase you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wanted to ask about the tweets.  Obviously this is a mechanism to speak to the markets and the company has said that, but people just like with the president, they argue are the tweets critical to his success or is he hurting himself with tweets.</p><p>I wonder how you view the Musk communications generally, whether it's Twitter, whether it's going on pod casts and smoking weed -- is this part of the brand and part of the genius or is it a downside and you wish he would stop talking?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, again, as I said earlier, with Twitter we get a lot of transparency.  And you don't get that with other CEOs.  So I think in a lot of ways investors, this gives us more information.  Now, sometimes he does unpredictable things like the 420 but in general, you know, 420 tweet.</p><p>In general, again, we see the board supporting Musk which is really important for an innovative company like Tesla.  And, you know, as we look forward as the auto industry transitions to electric autonomous vehicles, Tesla's years ahead of the competition.</p><p>And so we don't think that little blips like this are going to sort of affect that competitive advantage that Tesla's built in terms of batteries, in terms of autonomous hardware and in terms of autonomous data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you don't even need to look ahead to autonomous vehicles.  I had this discussion with someone I'm very close to over the weekend who works in Silicon Valley.  Every other automaker, even luxury automakers in Germany, Japanese and American -- they are awful at software.</p><p>There is no other car and no other car company that compares to a Tesla.  We all as drivers and consumers ought to be rooting for this company.  You don't have to own stock in it but you ought to be rooting for them because hopefully all these other automakers will realize oh, our software stinks.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  And automakers really haven't even owned that part of the supply chain.  The software side of things.  They're bringing in all of these components from different suppliers and Tesla's vertically integrated.</p><p>So this is a huge challenge to the traditional companies.  And I mean if you don't -- just take one thing over the air updates.  the car gets better overnight.  Why haven't other automakers been able to do this?  I mean it's ridiculous that Tesla's actually been doing this for years now.  And no one has caught up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they're dug in and they literally don't know now to run a car company in the new century.  That's literally what these companies look like.</p><p>If you -- I'm surprised.  And I'm surprised that Apple and Google haven't done more to try and manufacture a car or produce software for one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How secured is Tesla's funding?</p><p>Keeney:  So, you know, I think in general if we look at funding for Tesla, ok, so say if you were worried about cash, we actually as investors would be ok with an equity dilution because we just want them to get as many cars on the road as possible.  Each of the cars acts like a mini R&amp;D center.  It collects data for Tesla and it gets it toward that vision of full autonomy because Machine learning improves with the more data you feed it.</p><p>So we're actually factoring in a $10 billion to $20 billion equity dilution over the next five years.  And again, we would be ok with that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How soon do they need to raise more capital?</p><p>KEENEY:  So you know they've again, they said that they're ok with cash at the end of the quarter.  So no immediate expectations for that to happen.  Now, if things were to change which we certainly think they could, again, that would be ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just to be clear, the stock is down almost 9 percent right now.  Would you buy it here?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, I can't say whether or not we would buy or sell but you know, again, our long term visit .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to tell clients something, right?</p><p>KEENEY:  Well, you know, the market hasn't opened yet.  But the long-term vision for Tesla has not changed.</p><p>I mean we still think they're the largest producer of batteries in the world.  They're the only company that's collecting data off its customer cars on the road, we've seen every other company that's working on autonomous driving have issues, Waymo is having technical issues, the commercial launch was much watered down than what se expected.</p><p>I mean Tesla could launch a fully autonomous car in the next couple of years and then they're really going to run away from the competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I still think he's acted like a jerk in the past but again, like I said everybody in this country ought to be rooting for the success of this company in one way shape or form because it is 's the way of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tasha -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Tasha Keeney, ARK Investment.</p><p>Coming up a major e-cigarettes warning this morning, dozens of users reporting to the FDA that they're suffering features.  The health risk around vaping coming up.</p><p>And then changing the Wall Street\" uniform.  Patagonia takes a stand when it comes to which companies wear its clothes.  Stay with us.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A new potential health risk for e-cigarette users.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Pretty serious one, Maria.</p><p>The Food and Drug administration is revealing about three dozen reports of seizures among e-cigarette users, mainly younger people.  Nicotine poisoning is believed to cause seizures and even brain injury.  Last month the FDA outlined new restrictions on sales of most flavored e-cigs to fight underage use of them.</p><p>Well, billionaire/investor, Carl Icahn reportedly sold his stake in Lyft to fellow billionaire, George Soros before the company's IPO last week.  Sources telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Icahn held about a 2.7 percent stake in Lyft which was valued at about $550 million -- that's the IPO price.</p><p>It is not known why Icahn sold his stake or how much Soros paid for it.  Lyft is up about a fraction of a percent this morning.</p><p>Three global automakers teaming up to create safety standards for self-driving cars.  Ford, GM and Toyota plan to set up the automated vehicle safety consortium, focusing on building a safety framework for autonomous vehicles.  Self-driving cars have come under increased scrutiny since, of course, the fatal crash of an Uber test vehicle last year.  The Ford, GM, Toyota initiative is notable because it involves large car makers but no technology firms who probably will want to weigh in on any new rules.</p><p>And those are your headlines -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  all right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the delay in the U.K., trying to avoid a no deal exit from the European Union.  British lawmakers are now looking for another deadline extension.  We've got the details out of London coming up.  then the college admissions scandal, Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman facing a judge.  The courtroom drama coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  British lawmakers are voting to force prime minister Theresa May to ask the E.U. for another extension to exit the European Union.</p><p>Ashley Webster with the very latest right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We go around and around and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Round and round and round.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- and around we go.  Nothing much as changes other than yes there is a bill that whisked it went through the House of commons yesterday, basically telling Theresa May that she must go to The European Union and ask for an extension which, by the way, the new deadline is a week from tomorrow.</p><p>That went through the House of commons.  It's now in the House of Lords.  It's kind of like the House and the Senate in the U.K.</p><p>Generally nothing of interest ever happens in the House of Lords so this is ground-breaking by itself, that they're actually debating this issue in the House of Lords and doing it quickly.  Nothing quickly happens in the House of Lords.</p><p>And now there's a belief that some conservatives in the House of Lords are so upset with this whole process they may filibuster.  They may talk for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to try to prevent this from going through.</p><p>The bottom line ok, Prime Minister go ask for another deadline from the E.U. It doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.  for the an tension, doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.</p><p>What's interesting is this whole affair has not really moved forward in three years.  You can't come to a majority, a consensus on what the plan is to get the heck out of the E.U.</p><p>What's interesting though is there's a new poll out in the U.K., that says 83 percent of U.K. citizens, sick of talking about Brexit, 64 percent believe it's harmful to their mental health.</p><p>I think we can all agree with that.  But it's certainly --</p><p>And another interesting angle to this, Maria and gang, there are 10,000 riot police that have been undergoing extensive training in the last couple of weeks.  They are ready to deploy in a heartbeat.  That doesn't mean to say they're going to be needed but there has been a ramping up of emotions</p><p>The number of crimes related to Brexit have doubled in the last two weeks.  Not a huge amount but there are incidents where harsh rhetoric is now being translated into actual action.  And there's actual a concern if this continues to drag on and Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British people in that referendum, that things could spill on the streets.</p><p>There are 10,000 riot troops ready to go.  It's a little .   And there's a concern if this continues to drag on and the Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British riot troops ready to go.</p><p>It's a little bit of a scare thing.  Haven't been used and so far, it's been pretty civil, I have to say.  But there's no doubt tensions and emotions are frayed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are always people looking for a reason to loot, aren't they?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly in France.  There's always a small group of anarchists who will jump onto any cause just so they can smash up some shops.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And get what?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Get some free jeans.  Get free stuff.  There's always that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Ashley's -- East London accent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes. But there are people who would jump on any cause just to create problems.  So there is that kind of lurking in the background.</p><p>Bottom line is can Theresa May survive this?  Who knows?  Who would want her job right now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But if she cuts a deal with the Labour Party --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  this is going to be either no Brexit or something that's VERY close to no Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It's going to be a very soft Brexit.  And you know, will Corbyn insist on a second referendum, no matter what deal they make, the choice going back to the people, saying this is the deal we've got.</p><p>Vote for this or we forget the whole thing and stay in Europe.  That could be the next move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will that do to markets.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Uncertainties, sterling ha taken another hit.  We know  that it's funny, you know the economic news out of Europe, German manufacturing again came out really poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Italy and Germany GDP were cut.</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is not a good time economically for the E.U. and certainly the U.K. slowed down.  None of this is good because of the uncertainty.  Businesses aren't spending.  Businesses don't know what to do, especially if you have a lot of exposure to the continent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This referendum the people voted for -- they voted for Brexit --</p><p>WEBSTER:  52 to 48 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is basically being ignored on the installment plan, by the politicians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It was always 70 something percent of MPs who voted to remain and there's this strong belief that they would do anything they can to prevent it from happening. And one way to do that is to drag it out, get the U.K. involved in the European parliament elections coming up in May.  They do that this thing gets pushed further and further and further down the line.  And that happens is no Brexit.  That is the fear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all having an impact across the world.  I'm glad you mentioned the factory orders report out of Germany because you're the Eurozone economic numbers do not look good.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning the GDP expectations for Italy and Germany were cut again.  They're lucky to get 1 percent growth if at all in the Eurozone.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.  Completely stagnant.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That has to hit the U.S. at some point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course it does.  And you know, no matter what you think of the E.U. it's a huge trading bloc.  It is enormous and there's a lot of business done between the U.S. and the E.U. So it is going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to say, meantime you have political candidates here in the United States pointing to Europe as kind of the gold standard.  Yes, their economy can't grow.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is what socialism gets you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This could be an upside for us.  I was talking to one European BANK and he was saying this all of this debate and concern and uncertainty helps New York remain the world's financial center.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It does.  It's the only game in town.  And where are you going to put your money right now?  U.S. equities look pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Are American businesses, JPMorgans of the world, have they made a plan to stay in the U.K. or move some of their people to Germany?  What's the story.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There have been a lot of movement.  Bank of America moved a lot of its employees out of the -- out of London and to Dublin, to Ireland because their because they'll remain in the E.U.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I THINK There's no obvious competitor in Europe, Dublin, Frankfurt maybe has an argument, but I think London remains the European financial center because of the tradition, rule of law, people want to operate there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly hope so.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that's probably true regardless of what the is.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  I think you're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ashley -- great stuff.

But first, our top story this half an hour, the border battle, President Trump will visit the southern border in California tomorrow.  Griff Jenkins is at the border in McAllen, Texas right now.  Griff, good morning.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We just got some numbers here in the Rio Grande Valley.  I'm just steps from the border here.  That there were over 1,100 apprehensions of illegal crossers last night.  That is the 13th day of more than a thousand apprehensions that they're having in this surge of migrants, many of them family units.  We encountered more than 180 when we spent all day with the border patrol out on watch.  But they don't all surrender peacefully seeking asylum, sometimes they seek to evade being caught.  And we went into the sticks with them.  It's tough work.  Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  It's unbelievably difficult terrain.  I'm cut, my gloves torn.  This man rushing through here and we found a group, this is the first one we found, just nothing but thorns, bushes, bugs, snakes, spiders.</p><p>This is a spotlight.  You can see (INAUDIBLE), there they are.  They've got two more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) they tried to run.  This one right here was hiding underneath this brush to my left and this one right here just got up from the brush and took off running south but I was able to get him before he went got away.</p><p>JENKINS:  This is the brush underneath here, right where I am, where the last illegal crosser was laid down and Herman had to crawl in like this and go through these bushes and thorns.  It's just treacherous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  And that is not an extraordinary night by any stretch.  That's what they go through every night here.  Also folks are worried about this border closing.</p><p>As you know, Maria, Mexico is Texas' biggest trade partner to the tune of $187 billion.  We wait to see what happens as DHS Secretary Nielsen visits Arizona today, the president to California tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, it really looks like a crisis there, Griff.  Thank you.  Griff Jenkins joining us in McAllen this morning.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to close the southern border all together.  Mexican officials along the border are warning a port of entry delays are already causing tens of millions of dollars in losses for companies that do business along the border.  White House Economic director Larry Kudlow said that there's a way to keep freight lanes open should the border close.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE:  But regarding the economic impact of closing the border, which has not -- the president has not made a decision yet, as you know, I'm not aware that he has, one area we've explored is to try to keep the freight lanes open.  The truck lanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is congressman and House Agricultural Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Thanks, and it's always a pleasure to be here with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to this news this morning.  We're seeing the lines get longer.  We're seeing a lot of worry over the threat that the president could close the border.  How do you see it?</p><p>VAN DREW:  I sure -- I certainly hope he doesn't have to close the border.  I wouldn't want to see that.  It's obviously not good for business, it's not good for the economy.  So I'm hopeful that we can work this out.</p><p>Yet another example, and I know I drive it over and over again, but where we just need to have -- you know, more conversation, more bipartisanship.  We really need to do more here at the border to try to straighten this out.  If we can get the border under control, then we won't have the problem at the ports of entry with moving things through quickly enough.  And that's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, congressman, this is one of those examples of there are real issues happening in the country and in the world and instead, we have been focused in the last two years on this collusion narrative.  I know that you have come to Washington to get things done.  How are you dealing with your colleagues that seem to only want to take down Donald Trump and have ignored all of the issues going on that affect the American people?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I had a serious conversation with some of them just last night where we sat around a table and talked about it and I agree with exactly what you're saying.  I want to get things done.  People don't even realize at this point the bills that you hear about moving through the House of Representatives.  Most of them, the vast majority of them are not going anywhere.  They're going to get stopped at the senate, because, again, we're not having that conversation.  They're not moving through and becoming law.</p><p>So, I think at so many levels we need to take care of the issues that are real, whether it's Social Security, Medicare, healthcare, making sure that our veterans are taken care of.  I can go through an entire list for about 10 minutes of things that we need to do.  We need to get past this other part.</p><p>So, we're going to get the report.  Let's get the report, get as much that -- of it that is legal, and I want to emphasize that, that we legally can get, take a look at it.  If there's something there, deal with it.  If there's nothing there, that is horrendous, let's move on.  Let's get laws passed that -- you know, really can make a difference.  Let's get our business sector going even better.  Let's take care of the border issues so that we don't have what's now -- was first just a crisis of safety, is now also a humanitarian crisis and a business crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes for sure.  Then there's China and this of course impacts your constituents being on the Agricultural Committee.  I want to ask you about what's going on in China because I heard a story last night which really concerned me.  There is a swine flu outbreak in China, this deadly virus said to be spreading throughout the country, affecting a shocking number of pigs.  China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  But apparently 20 percent of the pigs are sick from this swine flu and they've got a hundred million pigs to dispose of.  Dead pigs.</p><p>In the past they would put the pigs in the -- in the ocean and just leave it.  But there are literally a hundred million dead pigs in China.  Have you heard about this?  Do you think there's going to be an impact to our agriculture?  Some people expect that this situation is going to ripple through different meats, chicken and steak, in terms of prices.  It's going to push all prices higher.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher, there's no question.  When -- you're going to have a shortage of meat and you're going to certainly going to have a shortage of pork and the prices are going to go up, number one.</p><p>Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God we have got a good Department of AGs to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.  Just to -- you know, arrest everybody's fears, this is nothing that you or I can catch from eating something.  This is something that goes from animal to animal through a variety of ways, sometimes when they eat waste that is infected from the flies and the transient insects that move around.  But it's a serious issue.  It's another serious issue.  It's another economic issue.  These are the types of issues that government should be working on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting out of a China deal?  The president is expected to tell us later today when he will meet President Xi in Mar-a-Lago.  I'm thinking -- I'm hearing it's either end of April, but likely -- more likely the beginning of May.  Do you think the U.S. is going to be able to get an enforcement mechanism in there to ensure that the Chinese do not steal intellectual property from America?</p><p>VAN DREW:  It may not be as good as we would want, but it's got to be better than it is.  Because it's something we can't put up with anymore.  And the stealing of intellectual property, the tampering with their monetary system as you know and many of the other things that they do are things that we just can't tolerate.  I think there's truth to those who say that for too long China has had the better end of the deal and I think we have to protect our American interest.</p><p>So I think this, again, is another very, very important issue that we've got to work on.  I think we're going to do better.  I believe we're going to do better.  But you know, Maria, this is going to be some hard, tough negotiating that's going to take place.  We're not playing with amateurs here.  These folks are serious.  And they're serious about being the new number one in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And they're looking long term but I think during the whole -- you know, Mueller report drama, the Chinese were questioning if they're even going to have to deal with Donald Trump.  Now after we know officially no collusion, the Chinese are saying we might have to deal with this guy for another eight years.  It just also underlines how irresponsible there was -- it was out there, the media, the Democrats, you know, parading around with this collusion story, basically giving an upper hand to the Chinese while he's trying to do a deal with them.</p><p>You mentioned the Mueller report a moment ago.  It's going to come out.  The Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 to subpoena the entire report.  Some members of the special counsel team reportedly saying that the results are more damaging to President Trump than Attorney General William Barr led on, that's coming from the New York Times today, the New York Times is clinging to this narrative, obviously.  Would the A.G. hide something?  I mean, would the new A.G. hide something in the Mueller report?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, call me naive, but I really believe in the system of law.  And I believe he wants to ensure to keep his good name, so I believe he's going to release what is supposed to be released.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the grand jury testimony, right, though?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Correct.  He can't release that.  That's by law.  But those areas where we're not going to hurt people, not the grand jury testimony, not something obviously that's confidential for certain reasons but the majority of it, a good piece of that report could be released.</p><p>And if that's true, then that will come out.  I'm one -- let me say this, you know, I'm a Democrat.  But frankly, I was glad when it seems to be that there might not be much there because it's important that we can move forward for the next year and-a-half that our president can be effective.  We're going to have an election, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  When we have that election, we can hash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let the voters decide.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Exactly.  Let the voters decide.  Let's hash this out.  Let's have the big, grand argument that everybody wants to have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Right now is the time to accomplish goals and get things done.  And the China deal is an example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one thing that the voters are going to decide on -- one thing that the voters are going to decide on are some of these radical ideas, congressman.  I mean, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill for CEOs to receive jail time after data breaches.  Warren treated this yesterday, today I'm proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families.  Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you'll go to jail.  She wants to make it easier for CEOs to go to jail, congressman.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I think if they've done something truly wrong, truly hurtful and truly illegal, then there can be some truth to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  But I don't necessarily love a full-fledged attack that's occurring in certain sectors on business in general.  That business is bad, that the capitalistic system is bad, that we should change the whole playing field.  You know, I've said this to you before I'm a capitalist.  I'm proud to be a capitalist.  I'm a capitalist and I like to -- you know, have a little phone that I'm a compassionate capitalist.  But that -- I mean that for real that -- you know, there is a place for government.  We want to make sure people don't fall through the cracks.  This is not just Laissez-faire capitalism.</p><p>However, we want to make sure that this economic engine that is taking so many of us to such good places in so many ways is even expanded more and even takes more of us and enables us to live the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well-said, congressman.  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Van Drew.</p><p>Coming up, the college admissions scandal is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Constellation Brands out with earnings right now.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We've got the numbers, Maria.  Constellation Brands reporting better than expected results for Q4.  The company posting adjusted profit of a $1.84 a share, revenue of $1.8 billion.  The company also selling about 30 of its lower priced wine brands to E. &amp; J. Gallo for $1.7 billion.  Some of the names, Clos du Bois, Mark West wines and several others.  Shares of Constellation Brands higher in the premarket.</p><p>All right.  Well, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin appearing for the first time in federal court in Boston over the college admissions scandal.  Both are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.  Prosecutors reportedly asking for jail time for everyone charged in the case.  Now the actresses have forfeited their passports.  Loughlin, we should ask, stopped to sign autographs outside of the courthouse after her appearance, Aunt Becky fans in Boston yesterday.</p><p>All right, Patagonia no longer selling its popular vest through corporate sales programs.  These vests with finance from logos on them , kind of a wardrobe staple on Wall Street if you're a New Yorker, especially for those workers that trade in those formal suits for that more casual look for the trading floor.  Patagonia says it wants to add new businesses to its client list, ones that quote, meet certain environmental, social and transparency standards.  The company adding existing corporate customers can remain in the program.  OK, way to make your views there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Patagonia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too much.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, real estate is heating up.  Investors are finding it's the perfect time to make a buck in the housing market.  Details on the making -- the money making opportunity rather.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeted on the GOP.  Here's what the president writes, the Republican Party is the party of the American dream.</p><p>Well, let's talk about that because spring has sprung for potential home buyers, falling rates and increased inventory pushing a buyer's market.  Joining us now to give us the state of business is Dolly Lenz Real Estate co-founder, Dolly Lenz and Dolly Lenz Real Estate managing director, Jenny Lenz.  Jenny and Dolly, it is good to see you both.</p><p>DOLLY LENZ, CO-FOUNDER, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  You too.</p><p>JENNY LENZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Asses the market for us, what are you expecting this summer in real estate?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Well, we're seeing a lot more inquiries, we're seeing lots of people at open houses, which is great, right?  That starts the process.  And we're seeing people happy that it's spring.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right?  They go outside, there's flowers blooming.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you think the prices are going to come down?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Yes.  But it doesn't mean they're not going to take advantage of those prices coming down, right?  Buyers will buy if they get a bargain.  So they're looking for that bargain.  Interest rates are so good now that anybody looking to buy is saving, what, 0.3 percent from just a month ago.</p><p>J. LENZ:  And as sellers become more realistic, you know, we're going to see a lot more traction, a lot more buyers in the market.  As she said, you know, spring is just the best time of year for New Yorkers.  It really is a seasonal, somewhat of a seasonal market.  No one wants to go see stuff in the winter, it's cold, everything looks terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about the millionaire's tax?  Let's get into the taxes that are -- that are taking effect.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Not good -- not good.  Millionaire's tax is really another trifecta problem, right?  So, large supply of inventory, over-supply of inventory, lack of foreign buyers and now this tax, right?  And plus the original tax, it's not good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The cap on state and local tax deductions.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deduction on the mortgage interest (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>D. LENZ:  Which isn't even a cap, it's really a elimination, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Because most people pay more than $10,000, so it is an elimination of real estate tax reductions.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The number transactions in Manhattan in the first quarter I read was the lowest in 10 years.  So it is having -- people don't want to buy in high tax states for myriad reasons.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, and we're also seeing the huge move down to places like Florida because it's not a -- you know, a tax state.</p><p>J. LENZ:  Right, and ultimately, this will all be priced into condos in Manhattan, right?  If you're going to make us pay higher taxes, we're not going to pay as much for an apartment.  That's what we're seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, just to be clear, James, in California high earners are taxed 9.3 percent, plus an additional one percent surcharge on income over a million dollars.  On the opposite coast, New York's upper cast taxed 8.82 percent on income over a million in 2018.  And that's not including an additional millionaire's tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Or the New York city tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait a minute, we don't get the California weather either.  So maybe there's not a good deal there.  (INAUDIBLE) OK, so not a lot of buyers, prices lately not that firm.  One, the people who are looking to buy, what are they looking for?  Is it different from previous times?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Well, they're looking for smaller, more efficient, newer homes and especially --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 4, 2019][Time: 06:00:00][Tran: 040401cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Carlos Ghosn Rearrested; FB Records Exposed; Amazon Moves Worldwide Operations Team From Seattle To Bellevue; China I.P.

And Happy Thursday, everybody, thanks for joining us.  Good morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Carlos Ghosn back behind bars this morning.  Last night, what an unbelievable night I had.  I was about to start an exclusive interview on the telephone with the former Nissan CEO when all of a sudden, 10 agents stormed into his apartment and arrested him.  Took him away in a car.  I'll tell you all about it, the full story coming up.</p><p>Startling new details this morning in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, preliminary results of the investigation blaming Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.  Tesla deliveries heading reverse, the automaker reporting a decline of more than 30 percent in the first quarter.  Plus, the Securities and Exchange Commission case over Elon Musk's tweets, that's headed to court today.  Meanwhile this, Conor McGregor may be coming out of retirement.  The cryptic tweet that's sending shockwaves through the MMA world this morning.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And good morning.  The markets this morning are showing some declines.  Take a look at Futures edging lower with investors focusing on the U.S.-China trade talks this morning, as authorities in Japan re-arrest former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn is now facing new charges of financial misconduct.  He denies any wrongdoing.  I spoke with Ghosn this week.  He said in a statement last night, my arrest this morning is outrageous and arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman; and republican strategist Erin Elmore.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see everybody.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what a night last night.  We scheduled an interview with Carlos Ghosn at 5:30 p.m. last night.  I came back to work, I'm sitting there, getting ready for the interview.  I'm texting with his lawyer, his lawyer says, OK, he's going to be calling in momentarily.  Now, it's 10 to 6:00, we're waiting for Carlos to call in to discuss the interview.  I had already spoken with Carlos Ghosn over the weekend on Saturday, and he discussed the charges, told me everything that you've heard here first for the last 100 days, that this was a coup, he's denying all of these charges and saying that he is innocent.</p><p>All of a sudden, I get this text from the lawyers, 10 agents just showed up, they are -- they took him into a room, they're in the room alone with Carole, his wife, Carole and Carlos Ghosn in the room with prosecutors, talking for a few minutes.  Then, we see them take Carlos in the car and drive away.  They took him to the prosecutor's office and they interrogated him.  He was there -- we were unclear if they were going to put him back in detention or if they were just going to question him.  In the meanwhile, agents went back to the house and they started interrogating his wife, Carole Ghosn.</p><p>Now, part of the reason here is because, as you remember, he put out that tweet a week ago, saying I'm going to -- it's time for me to tell the truth, to tell everyone what's going on, that he wanted to give a press conference, he was expecting to give a press conference on April 11th next week, they did not like the fact that he was going to discuss publicly, I believe, his phones obviously are tapped, the phone is lawyer -- a phone from his lawyer and I believe they are probably tapping Carole Ghosn's phone as well.  Because they probably knew that he was about to talk to the media, he was going to do this interview with me.  And so, they went right when we were going to do the interview, at 10 to 6:00 in the morning.</p><p>Then, they went back, they interrogated Carole Ghosn.  And they -- she wanted to go to the bathroom, they went in the bathroom with her.  She wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the bathroom, in the shower, while she was in the shower, taking a shower.  They want to break him.  The judicial system in japan is such that they want a confession on all of these charges, something that he is refusing to give.  This is an extraordinary situation, it is getting worse.  He is once again behind bars.  He could be there another -- he could be there 10 days and then they could add another 10 days to it, meaning he'll be there another 20 days before he can apply for bail to come out before a trial.  All Carlos Ghosn is asking for is a fair trial.  It doesn't look like he's going to get one.</p><p>ELMORE:  Would you know this, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>ELMORE:  That in Japan, there's a 99 percent conviction rate.  So, the odds are really stacked against him here.  He's also asking that the other defendants, his colleague, Greg Kelly and Nissan itself will be in a separate trial, so then he will get a more fair trial.  However, what I heard from Japanese legal experts is that once you've been released on bail once, you're not likely to be rearrested once, twice, or even three times which has happened to him here.  So, the odds are truly stacked against him.  It does not look good for him.  99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wasn't going anywhere.  He was not a flight risk.  He was in an apartment that was approved by the Japanese government.  He wasn't violating any parole, but they went and they took him.  Now, this new charge that they're trying to make is that he sent money to a company in Oman, Jordan and he used that money, and then he used the money -- and then they paid him to buy a yacht, to spend money on personal items.  That cannot be proven.  I mean, money is fungible, there's no way to say that the money that Nissan paid to this dealer in Oman was the money that he used to buy his yacht.  It's just -- it's very hard case to make.  His team believes that one of the reasons that they went back to arrest him overnight is because their case is falling apart.</p><p>Now, Carlos Ghosn told me on the phone over the weekend, the reason that this all happened, this coup happened underneath him is because the company was not doing well.  The company was collapsing.  His underlings thought they would, number one, be fired; and number two, that he was going to merge the company with Renault.</p><p>He told me he wasn't planning on merging the company with Renault.  However, he was planning a lot more consolidation, and he was in fact, having to fire people.  He had to consolidate because the company, if you look at the stock chart, if you look at the losses, if you look at the decline in revenue, the company was not doing well.  I don't know how Nissan does any better.  I mean, I'm sure that there are going to be activists that want to boycott Nissan, boycott Japan.  I mean, for a foreigner operating in Japan, what does this look like to you, James?  This is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you certainly had a situation where the Japanese managers at the company did not want him in charge, did not want to be run by a European company.  So, I think that's one of the big questions about this case, along with obviously a lot of people as they got to know the Japanese legal system over the last several months, seeing how long someone can be detained without access to a lawyer, pretty shocking.  But also this question of why now?  Why -- he's been running the organization for years and then all of a sudden when they see this potential consolidation of power in Europe, not in Japan, the Japanese executives come up with these charges against him.  Very suspicious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're also coming up with reasons to question Carole Ghosn.  They took her passport, they took her phone, she no longer has the phone.  He no longer has a phone.  They said sources close to Carole said that they wanted her to voluntarily answer questions.  When I wanted to use the bathroom, the officer entered the bathroom with me and did a body check.  When I wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the shower with her while she showered.  They wanted to humiliate Carole Ghosn, they wanted to intimidate her, and they want to intimidate Carlos Ghosn into confessing.  This is what this is all about.  Let's break him so that he admits to all of this, then he can get out.  All he wants is a fair trial.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where is the -- where is the global outrage about this?  About any CEO, whether it's one in the United States or in any other nation that does business in Japan being outraged?  Their -- the backs of their heads should be blowing off in rage, quite frankly.  The fact that -- I mean, what does this say about the abuse of people, of non -- of the non-Japanese?  And I pointed out, this is a cultural problem, it's not just a problem with the judiciary system.  It's that Carlos Ghosn and his family are targets because they're gaijin, they're non-Japanese.  What -- how is it possible in a developed nation that you have a prosecutor that follows the wife of someone who is under arrest into a bathroom?  Does a body search of that individual and then stands in the bathroom when the wife showers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, this is almost beyond comprehension.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's barbaric, and that is what it is, barbaric.  And I -- and this is something else that I heard, insiders told me that now there's a fight or -- going on between the Prime Minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  Apparently, the prime minister's office has been saying why would we re-arrest him?  This is going to be a stain on Japan.  But the prosecutor's office is feeling like this is my -- you know, this is my situation, and I want Carlos Ghosn to admit this, and they went forward.  But there is a bit of, you know, back and forth between the Prime Minister's Office and the Prosecutor's Office.  They have different takes on how to proceed.</p><p>And I think it's because of what you just mentioned, the global reaction to this.  Where are the global investors, where are the global CEOs to say, this is wrong, stop this treatment of Carlos Ghosn, particularly since over the years he's been hailed as a superman for rescuing Nissan?  He was a comic book character.  They've written books about him and stories about him, about what a strong and leadership position he has taken on in this company.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And we'll see.  I mean, eventually, this will get tried.  There will be a public disclosure, a lot of which there hasn't been to this point.  So, we'll see if they can make a case.  But I think in the meantime, to kind of reassure people, especially people looking to do business in Japan, they might -- prosecutors might start by explaining what they're doing.  I think to someone looking at it from afar, you don't even understand the possible reason for this shower episode.  What -- I mean, what is the justification and what is the reason, what is the theory that requires this kind of intrusion into, again, a relative of the accused, not the accused?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm guessing -- I'm guessing, they're trying to put more pressure on him to cut a deal.  Again, then with 99 percent conviction rate, number one.  And number two, they're trying to make sure that his story doesn't get out to the world media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking phones away.  They're putting -- they're intimidating his wife.  They're trying to make sure that the rest of the world doesn't find out what is going in -- going on within the Japanese judicial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Which is why they started -- rumors were circulating that he was going to be rearrested yesterday before they actually showed up at the House because he was talking about giving a press conference on April 11th.  And I'm sure that because I was communicating with them through the wife's phone, they probably had her phone tapped because it's too coincidental that they show up right before we were about to go on air.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's always a why now, why was he rearrested then at that moment, that's the why now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll keep following this, obviously.  We want some answers from the prosecutor's office and we want to actually understand why a female prosecutor had to stay in the shower when Carole Ghosn was taking a shower and be in the bathroom when she was in the bathroom.  What is going on in Japan?  We're going to cover it here.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal has done incredible reporting on this this morning as well.  A preliminary report on the Ethiopian plane crash, meanwhile, is taking aim at Boeing.  Cheryl Casone with that story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting that breaking news within the last couple of hours, Maria.  This report is critical of Boeing's instructions for the updated 737 Max 8 jets.  It found, and this again is an Ethiopian report, that the Ethiopian jet repeatedly nose-dived before it went down and that the flight crew have performed all procedures that were recommended by Boeing, but were still unable to control the plane which kept nose-diving over and over.  Now, investigators blamed an anti-stall feature on the 737.  That, of course, has been a focus of this global investigation.  The report from the Ethiopians recommends that the flight control system be reviewed by Boeing and that aviation authorities should verify this system before the aircraft is put back into operation.  No real effect on Boeing stock though right now.  It's basically flat in the premarket.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Facebook, they are under fire again.  A cyber security firm has discovered that hundreds of millions of Facebook records were exposed on Amazon's Cloud servers.  The firm says the information included account names, e-mail addresses, and comments, and that all of it can be downloaded by the public.  Now, Facebook says it worked with Amazon to remove the databases once it did learn about the issue.  But now, of course, it's becoming public, the stock as you can see, Facebook up about three-quarters of a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Amazon moving thousands of employees from Seattle to a city that's nearby.  They're planning to relocate the entire worldwide operations division to Bellevue, Washington by 2023.  An Amazon spokesperson says the company is looking forward to bringing more jobs to Bellevue.  And there, Maria, is Amazon in the premarket, slightly lower.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  Let's slip in a short break, then we're talking about China trade.  President Trump met with Chinese -- a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He today after talks proved productive yesterday.  We've got the details next.  Then, a possible retirement retraction, Conor McGregor's cryptic tweet and feud with a fellow MMA fighter may put him back in the octagon, much more ahead on that when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning.  Coming up, Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is with us this morning, along with New Jersey Congressman, House Agriculture Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  \"The Coming Collapse of China\" author, Gordon Chang is here; and former McDonald's CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman Ed Renzi.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big show right here in the next 2-1/2 hours.</p><p>First though, we want to kick this off with U.S.-China trade talks, President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House today.  The Vice Premier met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade representative Robert Lighthizer yesterday.  President Trump is likely to announce a summit between Chinese President Xi later today, that's according to The Wall Street Journal.  Joining me right now is InterDigital President and CEO, Bill Merritt.  And Bill, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>WILLIAM MERRITT, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, INTERDIGITAL:  Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  You're doing a lot of business in China.</p><p>MERRITT:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that.</p><p>MERRITT:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has that been for you?  Has the trade issues gotten in the way?</p><p>MERRITT:  Actually, I would say the trade issues have been very helpful to us.  I mean, the focus of the Trump administration on protection of intellectual property, we're a company that has 20,000 patents, covering wireless technology, and we've been trying to license in China for years, and we've given them this very stark fact, we've got 95 percent of the non-Chinese manufacturers under license, paying us more or less (INAUDIBLE) billions of dollars.  We don't have a single Chinese manufacturer under license today.  So, that's the focus by the administration on enforcing I.P., creating benchmarks to show that they're complying with I.P. has been actually very good for us.  And we -- you know, we're cheering them on in what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you've seen firsthand then, the theft of I.P.  Tell us about that.  I mean, how significant is it?  What kind of a cost do you see as it impacts your company, and do you think you're really going to be able to see I.P. theft go away, or is that a cultural thing in China?</p><p>MERRITT:  I don't think it's long-term cultural.  It has been.  I think it can change with enforcement.  You know, in terms of the impact, if you think about what we do and others in our industry do, we hand over the technology to the industry, to build phones, and the return is we then get licensed under the patents that cover that technology.  The impact has been when -- with the Chinese companies not paying royalties to us, they have extra money now to invest in research that we don't have.  And the impact has been in 5G.  They have got tons of money to invest in 5G while research companies like us don't have that money.  And it's creating this imbalance in the research environment for 5G.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  So -- well, so as you look at a Huawei or a ZTE product, do you say, hey, that's looks a lot like our stuff in there?  Or, I mean, how are they doing it without licensing?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, it's an open standard in the sense.  We contribute our technology to the standard, anybody can get it, anybody can build a phone.  So, any phone that's built, we know has our technology in it.  How do they get away with not paying royalties?  They simply just refuse to pay.  They hold out.  You know, a company like ZTE, we've been in litigation with ZTE for almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So, they owe you, they just don't pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're still in litigation?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, in terms of -- we have this I.P. theft, that's one thing.  But in China, there are no regulations in terms of workplace, labor, minimum wage.  How can we even level this playing field at all?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes, I think there's a lot of issues that go into leveling the playing field, right?  And there are some are within our ability, and others are not.  So, you know, things like intellectual property, certainly, there's ways to level that.  There's ways to level all these things, and I think President Trump tweeted a while back about 6G, and telling Americans, you have to compete with other people.  We're not going to just keep people out of the market.  We agree with that.  But compete on a level playing field, and I think he's doing a fantastic job at creating that level playing field as best we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of enforcement action do you think is possible to get the Chinese to keep their promise that they're not going to steal I.P.?  I mean, we're taking a look at Huawei a lot in terms of Huawei stealing trade secrets from Cisco, Motorola Solutions, you know, T-Mobile, et cetera.  So, what do you think it's going to take to get them to keep their promises that they won't steal?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, I think -- I think it's three things: first is a firm commitment from them; the second is the benchmarks, the benchmarks would be concrete activity, signing a certain number of license agreements are things that can be actually measured; and the third is some level of enforcement beyond that.  If those benchmarks are not met, I think that they will work to change what has been a difficult culture in time over time, but you have to work to change that culture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>MERRITT:  I appreciate all of your time.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Merritt there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning, the New York Post is reporting Uber spent $2 million to help push through congestion pricing.  Uber officials say that they're proud of their role in helping pass -- helping to pass the controversial plan to charge drivers a fee for entering Manhattan below 61st Street.  Roughly $1 million paid to some of the top city lobbyists, another 700,000 going to the Fix Our Transit coalition's ad campaign.</p><p>The Chicago Sun Times says Democratic socialists now control one-tenth of the Chicago City council.  Three Democratic socialists winning spots on the 50-seat council in Tuesday's elections.  They will join two others who won back in February.</p><p>And the L.A. Times this morning writes this, Disney shows off Fox titles to cinema owners as a new era takes shape.  Disney delivering a presentation at CinemaCon yesterday, kicking things off with a sizzle reel from several Fox films before showing off new footage from \"Aladdin\" and the \"Lion King.\"  Walt Disney Studio Chairman Alan Horn said that Disney would continue to support an exclusive theatrical release before making movies available at home.  Good stories there this morning.</p><p>But I want to get back to Bill Merritt that we were just talking about.  He made a really good point, as he was leaving, and that is, the Chinese discussions with the United States have taken a new form after the Mueller report was released and the fact that there was no collusion.  Because now the Chinese are saying to themselves, OK, we are looking long term, but now we might have to deal with this guy for eight years.  There's no collusion, he may very well win again, re-election.  So, it just tells you how the talks may very well have taken on a different tone given the U.S. an advantage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wanted to point out a story that's in the Wall Street Journal, too, that talks about -- looks like President Trump is going to announce the -- at least when that summit will take place on Thursday, that's the goal.  But that the United States is part of the enforcement mechanism, wants to keep these punitive tariffs in place.  We will leave the tariffs in place until you prove that you are abiding by this agreement, and that is the sticking point with the Chinese.  But I mean, tariffs on 200 -- you know, a quarter of a trillion dollars in imports in the United States, that's a very, very powerful enforcement mechanism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is poised to leave the tariffs in place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And so, that's -- that seems to be because China wants them kind of date certain for them lifting those tariffs.  And by the way, there are $110 billion worth of U.S. goods that have retaliatory tariffs slapped on them.  So, it's been a drag for the economy.  Certainly not a knockout punch, but a drag.  We'll see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, this whole Mueller report actually is a factor as well.  And the point that I was making was, can you imagine how irresponsible the media and the Democrats have been over the last two years by talking about things like treason, you know, this President committed all of these crimes for two years, it gave the Chinese this upper hand to think that they could actually have their way, that maybe this President is on his way out.  Now, that the Mueller report is out, and it's clear that there's no collusion, they're thinking, well, maybe we have to deal with him for eight years, we better get in line.  That's how irresponsible the last two years have been.  This President is trying to do international deals in North Korea, in China, and they've got the Democrats and the media driving this story, this narrative that never made sense.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So corrosive for people who would not accept the results of the 2016 election.  And we've talked about how investors generally never believed in collusion because you'd see headlines about this alleged conspiracy that put a Kremlin plant in the White House, and markets ignored it.  Essentially had this huge run-up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But that doesn't mean that foreign leaders, especially the nonmarket ones, didn't think maybe this guy is not going to be around, maybe there's something to collusion, and certainly to the extent, they believe it or even suspected it, it weakens his hand across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- and now, you have a whisper campaign that's just beginning, and I want to point out it would -- I'd be remised if I didn't.  The story in the New York Times that they posted yesterday, that people on Mueller's team are sending out signals that wound up on the front page of The New York Times, saying that Bill Barr understated the findings in the Mueller report.  I don't know what the motives are there.  If you read the story, there's really no there, there.  They won't say what it understated, there's no detail.  But again, this is the whisper campaign.  It might be an effort to push this -- the full Mueller report out, and make sure that Barr includes more information in it than he otherwise would.  But again, Robert Mueller is working with Bill Barr to decide what they can release to Congress and ultimately the public.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, first, they won't -- they won't adhere to the results of the 2016 election, now they won't adhere to the results of the special counsel who was godly in their -- in their minds just six months ago, and the attorney general.  You know, Jerry Nadler, the head of judiciary, is calling him a political appointee.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think the New York Times doesn't want to give up the dream, and you wish there was more of an understanding in the media generally that enormous destructive mistakes were made and they're ought to be some reassessment.  But I'm not seeing that at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The New York Times is clearly the aqueduct, carrying water for the people who hate the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And CNN as well.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media and the Democrat Party are one in the same at this point.  You have to just realize.  And they're paying the price for this.  So, there's no collusion.  Now, they're still questioning the report, and next they're saying, we want tax returns from the President.  What's next?  And how is this going to play out?  Not well for the Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  We'll talk about that.  We've got to talk about 2020 because now, Congressman Tim Ryan is going to join the race as well.  We'll take a break, we'll talk about that.  Coming up, more accusations against Vice President Joe Biden after he responds to the initial allegations, what that means for a potential presidential bid.</p><p>More troubles, meanwhile, for Tesla, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in history, as Chief Elon Musk faces off with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  That's next, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are waiting on President Trump's China trade meeting today, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, Dow Futures down 17, S&amp;P down two, and the NASDAQ down seven.</p><p>Markets were a little changed yesterday, as well.  The DowIndustrials added 39 points on the session.  The S&amp;P was up 6, and the NASDAQ, top performer, up 46 points, that was two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, and we do see a mixed story, FT 100 down 41, that's one-half of one percent, CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15, that's a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany is up a fraction, six points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the indices were mixed and as you see, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite up about one percent.</p><p>There is a tornado threat, severe weather in parts of the south, this morning.  We'll have the very latest on your forecast.  And then, McGregor, shocking the MNA world with a tweet that could land him back in the octagon, got those details coming up.</p><p>Plus, this, start your engines, Dolly Parton makes a statement on the NASCAR track this weekend.  We will tell you how.  And wrap it up, Mexican food chain celebrating National Burrito Day today, in a big way, offering plenty of discounts and promotions, we've got all those coming up.</p><p>But first, we want to kick this half hour off with Tesla troubles, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in its history.  CEO Elon Musk, meanwhile, is facing off with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, in court, over contempt charges, Dagen on the story, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deliveries, let's clarify that, new vehicle deliveries in the first quarter for Tesla, fell 31 percent from the previous 3 months.  The electric car maker clearly struggling to ship its model 3 compact car to now customers in Europe and China, for the first time.</p><p>This fell came in even below analyst expectations.  That was the biggest drop-off.  We should point out that the first quarter was Tesla's, and so it was 31 percent drop in deliveries.  Last quarter was Tesla's first sales period following the beginning of the phase-out of that important U.S. tax credit.</p><p>So, the tax credit is now $3,750 per car, down from $7,500 for buyers.  That's another concern.  So, Tesla reported two straight quarters of profits, of profitability, it's not likely, based on these numbers, to be profitable in the first quarter.  That was kind of a warning that we got several weeks ago from Elon Musk, anyway.</p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock is doing premarket, before I move on to, well, court, today, for Elon Musk.  It's down 8-1/2 percent in premarket trading, so this delivery shortfall was a surprise and a big one, based on how the stocks moving this morning.</p><p>Meantime, here, in New York, a Federal judge is going to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that's trying to hold CEO Elon Musk in contempt for violating the settlement deal with the SEC.</p><p>This was over these tweets.  The settlement was over these tweets that he sent, funding secured, back in August, and then he was tweeting about how many cars that the company would produce.  He had to amend that tweet earlier this year.  This was in mid-February.</p><p>Here's what's going to happen, probably nothing.  That if the judge sides with the SEC, Elon Musk could get another fine, maybe a big one, limits on his social media use.  He will not get ousted as the CEO of Tesla, mark my words.  You know, it's theoretical, a possibility, but not going to happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Question for you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>ELMORE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not done.  We -- this is this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, in a Manhattan courtroom.  It's not clear if Elon Musk is going to be there.  I would say, not likely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In a Manhattan courtroom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's it.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, I was going to ask you, since he has this agreement with them, and this is a contempt hearing, I think it's likely that he will be found in contempt.  He did violate the settlement from last fall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He argues that he didn't.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He says that the settlement -- that the SEC says in place, that they are trying to enforce it in a way that it does not exist.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they did.  The -- it's -- he is supposed to have people, in the company, review the tweets before they go out.  The tweet was quickly amended and it wasn't off-base, based on things that had been communicated to investors.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm talking about the tweet in February, I think that this is a whole lot of nothing and the SEC doesn't like being called the short seller enrichment commission by Elon Musk.</p><p>So, I think that he has been poking the bear and the bear is clawing back, and I don't think anything significant happens out of this court hearing today, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He likes to poke the bear, the SEC, and he likes to poke the short sellers too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>ELMORE:  And we'd like -- we have to see how aggressive the SEC is going to get today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  What was that, funding secured twitter message that got him in trouble in the first place.  Looks like production not secured either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Hey, let's talk 2020, guys, because new developments here, Joe Biden, first, three more women reportedly accusing the former vice president of inappropriate behavior.  Biden broke his silence and he released a video.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Social norms have begun to change, they've shifted, and boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it.  I get it.  I hear what they're saying.  I understand it.  And I'll be much more mindful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Karl Rove is weighing in this morning in the Journal.  The Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush has a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled this, Don't Count Joe Biden Out.</p><p>Rove writes this, Mr. Biden's subsequent apologies and his promise Wednesday to be more mindful because social norms are changing are acknowledgements that he is struggling in today's Me Too culture.  This reinforces the sense that his first day as presidential candidate will be his best one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I don't know about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As the touchy, feely person on the panel --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll weigh in on this, and I'll get into trouble, but I think it's always been the responsibility of a woman, if a man gets in your space, or another woman gets in your space, then you need to look at him and say, hey bud, you need to have an elbow here, and say, you know what, I'm not that kind of person, don't like, pinch my elbow, don't -- because I'm not that kind of person and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have what I would do, get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have said that to people.  There was a creepy guy who was on air, once, here, it's not anybody working in management or who was on staff, but he started giving me a shoulder rub in the hair room, and I turned around, I was like, you need to put it in reverse, buddy, and back this truck up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back off.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't put your hands on me.  And you know what?  If somebody like Joe Biden, like, put his arm around me, I would just think that that was just a sign of affection --</p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in a very, excuse me, nonsexual way, Southerners are exactly like this, men and women, and I always hate it, because I encountered this in New York, where you would refer to somebody -- when I first started working here as, thanks, hon.</p><p>And then, the person would go around you, and go to management, and complain about you, rather than just looking you in the eye and saying, please, don't address me that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm not your honey.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, that's why -- I</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what I hear you saying is, he shouldn't get bullied out of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just because he smells somebody's hair or kisses them, maybe he shouldn't get bullied by this, even though norms have changed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I find it very --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's no tolerance --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- suspect that these women come out now, and then complain about it publicly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when he's about to declare his run for the Democratic nomination.  People who clearly, one of them, at least, a Bernie Sanders supporter.  That they say it publicly, but never had -- never looked at him and said, you know, and said, I'm not comfortable with this.</p><p>ELMORE:  But speaking of publicly, all of this conduct occurred in public.  No one is alleging anything that wasn't on camera or in front of a big crowd.  No one said things happened behind closed doors or in a bar or in a restaurant or in a hotel or on text.  This was all conduct that occurred in the public eye.  So, what could have really happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, will we be talking about Biden, as a 2020 contender, in six months?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will he be able to get over this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- really quickly, the one thing that he does -- that Karl Rove writes about, which you mentioned, that he needs to stop apologizing.  Remember, Cynthia Nixon called him out for referring to Vice President Mike Pence as being decent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We actually talked about that on the show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he needs to stop apologizing for that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, his only premise as a candidate is that he's going to chart a more moderate course.  So, if he begins his candidacy, if he does become a candidate, and he spends all of this time trying to persuade people that he's just as woke, just as hard left as the other candidates, then there's no point in running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can tell you for sure that Congressman Tim Ryan, from Ohio, will enter the race. He is going to run for the presidency.  So, this question about Joe Biden is opening up a whole new avenue for Tim Ryan.  He could be a force because he's from Ohio, he's a working man's guy, he's not radical left, crazy idea Green New Deal, 70 percent tax rates.  What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this does look like a bet that Biden's not running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But, you know, he's not --Ryan is not that moderate, so that's going to be a question, but definitely, striking a more moderate tone at least.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  They can't beat you on ideas.  They'll try and shut down based on your personality, and I think Joe Biden's feeling that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, moderate relative to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a short break, then we've got to get to Cheryl.  Markets are lower this morning after finishing higher yesterday.  We'll tell you what's moving and we'll tell you the big news of the morning when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new CEO at PG&amp;E.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE:  Maria, good morning again.  PG&amp;E tapping Bill Johnson, he is the current head of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  He will now lead the troubled California utility.  PG&amp;E also announcing a new board as it looks for a way out of bankruptcy.  They face billions of dollars in liabilities for their role in starting deadly wildfires in California.</p><p>Well, severe weather in the south to tell you about, after hitting Texas, a series of thunderstorms is ready to slam other southern states, including Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi.  Large hail and damaging winds expected across the region today.  A few tornadoes could develop.  Forecasters say the system is going to continue to move east tomorrow.</p><p>And finally, Maria, it is National Burrito Day.  Mexican food chains from Chipotle, (INAUDIBLE) are offering deals to celebrate.  And you can be, if you want, a human burrito.  Yep.  Tortilla blankets for babies and adults now viral.  Now, if a burrito isn't your thing, Maria, and I have no idea if it's not, possibly more important, May 5th is National Enchilada Day.  Let's get excited about that.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I really want to wrap up like a burrito.</p><p>CASONE:  Don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, markets this morning seem to be searching for direction, of course we are waiting on news out of the China-U.S. trade talks.  They are close.  I understand that we got a market that is very close to where the indices closed yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon out with this annual letter.  In it he says this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.  Joining us right now the Kadina Group President, Gary B. Smith.  Gary, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see markets today?  Are you still bullish?</p><p>SMITH:  I am getting less bullish, I'm afraid.  You know, the times that we've been together in New York, I think I was very bullish.  Hopefully at the right time.  Now, as we start to get toward those old highs and the fact that volatility has dropped, back to where it was in last October, when there was really nothing on the horizon to bother it, bothers me.  Because it tells me there might be something out there.  We don't know what it is, some black swan event.  Maybe it's in the investigation into Trump's tax returns, maybe it's the whole China thing going south.  I get worried as we approach those old highs, especially as we've gone almost straight up since Christmas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anywhere to hide?  Real quick.  You're expecting a decline in stocks then?</p><p>SMITH:  I think we go to the old highs.  That's another 700 points.  I guess if I was an investor, I'd probably start to take a little off the table, maybe go to 50 percent cash as we get there and kind of wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks for weighing in briefly.  We appreciate it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Spurs' head coach ejected, just 63 seconds into the game.  Jared Max on sports, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Like they say, that escalated quickly.  Gregg Popovich, the first NBA coach in seven years to get kicked out of the game in the opening two minutes, barely lasted one minute -- 63 seconds into the Spurs' eventual loss at Denver.  Pop was gone after being issued a second technical foul.  Maybe something with coach from Texas last night, because the Houston Astros' manager and head coach were both kicked out pitch apart in a loss to the Rangers.</p><p>If you like trying to hit a golf ball through a moving windmill, you are going to want to check out Steph Curry's new venture.  Yes, the Golden State Warrior star is going to become the executive producer and resident golf pro for a 10-episode series on ABC called \"Holy Moly.\"  (INAUDIBLE) but are going together the best mini golf players to compete on epic course.  Each episode has 12 contestants and $25,000 to the winner for each show.</p><p>What was it?  Eight days ago?  We told you that that ultimate fighting champ star, Conor McGregor, said he was retiring and now we suspected that it probably wouldn't the case.  Well, last night, Conor McGregor pretty said he's unretiring, on the same day where had exchanged nasty tweets with fight rival, Khabib Nurmagomedov.  Conor wrote on Twitter: \"I want to move forward with my fans of all faiths and backgrounds.  All faiths challenge us to be our best selves.  It's one world and one for all.  And now, we see you in the Octagon.\"  So, he's going back.</p><p>And the queen of country is about to be the queen of the racetrack.  Check this out!  Dolly Parton is sponsoring her own race car driver.  Tyler Reddick is going to speed off in the pink Chevy Camaro at a race this weekend.  The Xfinity Series on Saturday in Dolly's home state of Tennessee in Bristol.  Dolly Parton on a race, Maria.  How cool is that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Do you know anything about that, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Xfinity race, which is on Saturday, and it's at Bristol motor speedway's thunder dome.  It's the greatest racetrack in racing, so everything should watch it and everybody loves Dolly, everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I like that pink car.  Thank you, Jared.  Jared's sports reports are on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.  Still ahead, the Patagonia power suit no more; why you'll no longer see the iconic clothing brand at some top tech and finance companies?  Right here, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2208138201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D0YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Investors are waiting on any news out of the China trade talks.  The president will meet with China's top negotiator at the White House this afternoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are lower but just by a fraction.  Dow Industrials down four points, S&amp;P down 2-1/4, NASDAQ down 16.  This after the markets were a little changed yesterday as well.  The NASDAQ was the top performer.  It was up two-thirds of one percent, 46 points higher.  The Dow Industrials were up 39 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.  In Europe this morning, the major indices are mostly lower.  The FT-100 is down 38 points, half a percent.</p><p>The CAC Quarante in Paris is down 17.  The DAX is higher, although well off the highs of the morning.  We did have had weaker-than-expected factory orders data out, and the GDP forecast, for ItalyGermany this morning, were downgraded.  In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher, as you can see there: Shanghai was the performer, China up almost one percent.  Startling new details this morning.  The Ethiopian Airlines crash; preliminary results of the investigation blamed Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.</p><p>Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO last night, 10 agents walked into his house and took him away in a car.  We've got full details this morning.  Now, the interrogation has moved to his wife.  They would not leave her alone last night; she could not go to the ladies' room alone.  She said she had to go to the bathroom, an agent left the door open, and waited right there while she was in the bathed.  She wanted to take a shower, a female agent stayed in the shower while she took a shower.</p><p>It's pretty extraordinary what's going on.  He is now back behind bars.  And, by the way, an update for you, prosecutors will not tell his lawyers why he was rearrested.  We don't know.  Google's voice assistant is getting some celebrity help.  Find out who's lending their voice.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman; and Republican Strategist Erin Elmore.  Good to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this Ghosn story is just incredible, in my view.  I don't know that it hampered any foreign investment into Japan, but you have to question the judicial system in Japan throwing somebody in jail without having his say or his chance, to explain himself.  Just to be clear, he says he's innocent and that this was a coup, as I've been reporting for a hundred days now, that the people at Nissan teamed up with the Ministers of Industry to take him down so that Renault would not acquire Nissan.  Pretty extraordinary stuff.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  This is the fourth time he's been re-arrested since December, which is very unusual in the Japanese legal system, which also has a 99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, this is all about squeezing Carlos Ghosn so much, so he admits to crimes that he did not do.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, they'll get to make their case but obviously, the Japanese executives did not want this European control of the business.  And you know, we'll see what their case is when they lay it out, but this kind of over the top series of actions, 10 agents, to capture Carlos Ghosn, as if he's some sort of -- you know -- crime -- chieftain, who's going to be fighting with them and they need 10 guys to restrain him.  The bathroom sequence with his wife, you mentioned, it just -- it's a series of things that make you wonder: what is the point here other than to intimidate as opposed to search for justice?  Well, eventually, we'll get to hear his side of the story, he was going to give his side to you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he was.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He wanted to then later have a larger press conference.  This seems to have disrupted that and we've learned with the Japanese legal system, they may be able to keep him in jail quite a while now without being able to talk further to his attorneys -- very different from United States.  I think we're all eager to finally hear his unfiltered account of events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, and just to be clear, I did speak with Carlos Ghosn last week.  And he says that this was a coup, his number two was afraid that he was going to get fired because the company was simply not doing well.  And they had missed expectations, and revenue declines for four straight quarters, and he was getting ready to announce some consolidation.  He said, he was not going to announce an out-and-out merger with Renault, but he was certainly going to make some big changes, and they didn't like that.</p><p>And so, they lured him to Japan, and they he arrested him with the help of the minister of industry in Japan.  I'm hearing now that there is a back-and-forth between prime minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  The prime minister's office did not want him rearrested.  They thought -- he thought that this would be a stain on Japan, but the prosecutor went ahead and did it.  10 agents showing up last night, like I said, right before we were about to do an interview, which leads me to question whether or not her phone is tapped as well.</p><p>We know that he has a government phone, the lawyer gave him the phone to use, while he was in this apartment in Tokyo.  But you know, I had been communicating with her, and her phone must be tapped. So, they showed up right before the interview to shut him down.  They don't want him giving a press conference either; he said he wanted a press conference on April 11th.  They don't want the news out; they don't want to hear his plea for innocence.  So, there you go you go.</p><p>We'll follow that.  Meanwhile, there is trouble for Tesla this morning.  The stock is sliding nearly 10 percent, following weak deliver numbers.  This is coming ahead of Elon Musk's SEC battle.  He's headed to the SEC in court with him today.  The stock is down 10 percent, as you can see.  Kristina Partsinevelos is outside the court house.  She's in downtown New York City.  And Kristina, are you expecting to see Elon Musk today?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  No, it seems like the rumor is that he probably won't show up, but you never know in these types of situations.  The SEC. the Security Exchange Commission will be debating here behind me against Elon Musk.  They're going to be squaring off at 2:00 p.m. time.  They're going to be giving their oral arguments which have already been received by the judge.  And what are they debating?  They are debating whether Elon Musk is in contempt for a tweet, that he sent out on February 19.</p><p>This tweet reads: \"Tesla made zero cars in 2011, but we'll make around 500,000 in 2019.\"  This tweet was later updated.  However, the SEC arguing that Musk infringed on his settlement with the SEC for a previous tweet in August where misled investors that he was going to take the company private.  What we know from that settlement is that he had to pay $20 million; Tesla had to pays $20 million.  He had to step down as chairman for three years, and he had to get his tweets preapproved.  And that's the major debate today.</p><p>Musk, though, his legal team, are saying in his defense, two reasons.  First, one, that his tweet on February 19th was a not material.  All of that information about production rate was already in the earnings report, was already discussed on conference call.  The second point is that all of this infringed on Elon Musk's freedom of speech.  This is going to be debated, Maria, today at 2:00 p.m.  The judge is -- according to legal experts we spoke to, not likely to come to a decision today, but could side with SEC, could side with Elon Musk, or scrap out the settlement altogether and start back at zero.  So, we'll find out around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  All right, Kristina, we'll be watching you all day today, ahead of that.  Kristina Partsinevelos in New York.  Meanwhile, we're going to turn to U.S.-China trade.  President Trump just tweeted moments ago he says this: \"Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the economy is looking very strong, and China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely.  There is little or no inflation and USA optimism is very high.\"  President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House.</p><p>The president is likely to announce as summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later today, according to the Wall Street Journal.  We are expecting that to be either later April or early May.  Joining me right now is the Author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang.  And Gordon, it's always a pleasure to see you.  First, let's talk about the trade deal, what are you expecting in terms of the main tenants of any deal?  Do you think we'll get to a deal between the U.S. and China?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR:  Well, everyone says there will be a deal that they've settled 90 percent of the points.  I'm not so sure that we're going to hear a deal announced in next day or so, you know, but next couple of months.  The question, though, is you know we've had a decades of failed trade agreements with China.  The question is do you remedy that with another deal?  So, we'll see how this goes, but, clearly, you know, this is heading in that direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks like the Chinese are willing to open up its markets, they're opening up the markets to financial services companies in the U.S. among other industries, and they're willing to buy more commodities.  What about the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, that's the real (INAUDIBLE) of the problem.  You know, people say: well, look, we're close to a deal, but they have not yet decided on the enforcement mechanisms that can get China to agree to.  And so, that is really going to be the critical thing.  And if President Trump doesn't agree to tough enforcement mechanisms, then clearly, this is not going to be a good deal for us.  But if there are tough enforcement mechanisms, Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler has a lot of incentive to say \"no,\" because they're building up this narrative of national humiliation in China.  And whenever they start talking about that, that's not a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then, there's Huawei.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, announcing it is ending collaborations with, and ZTE over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions.  MIT also said it's reviewing the school's collaborations with China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.  This is really getting dicey around Huawei.  I've spoken with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this.  He's trying to tell the Europeans: Look, you know, if you're going to use Huawei telecom, we're going to not share as much information with you.  This is high stakes on Huawei.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, it certainly is.  You know, and one of the arguments that the United States has been making is that, that the 2017 national intelligence law in China requires Chinese parties to spy on others if China demands it.  And certainly, you know, we've seen Huawei spy on the African Union, they did that for 12 -- for five years.  And so, clearly, there's a strong case there, but, you know, Huawei is really supported by the Chinese Diplomatic Corps.  Beijing has gotten behind this company, and that really should tell us a lot because this is a geopolitical issue for China, not just an economic one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you do think that the president will be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism?  Should the Chinese not keep up their promises, not to steal from United States if there is more stealing of I.P., they snap back more tariffs, or what?  What is the enforcement mechanism to get Beijing to keep the promises?</p><p>CHANG:  They're going to keep some tariffs on, and President Trump has been very clear about that for last month.  So, that looks like going it's to be the case.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with you.</p><p>CHANG:  And the Chinese have been saying: look, that's unacceptable to them.  Now, I don't know where the middle ground here is -- you know, but clearly, this is where we either have a trade deal or we don't have one.  And I sort of think that, you know, it's up to the president to just sort of increase the tariffs until the Chinese stop stealing our I.P.  Because, really, you know, we've had agreements with China and very detailed agreements with China, and they have just dishonored all them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, like the time they said they were going to buy all those beefs, and then they never bought the beef.  I got to get your take on swine flu outbreak in China.  China is not talking about this at all.  But I was talking to an American businessman last night and he was telling me that China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  And right now, 20 percent of the pigs are diseased with swine flu.  So, they are dying -- 20 percent of the pigs in China means that is a 100 million dead pigs.  What are they going to do with a 100 million dead pigs?  How do you dispose of 100 million dead pigs?</p><p>CHANG:  You know, in previous instances like this, they just dump them in the river.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly!  But they can't dump 100 million dead pigs in the river, right?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, there's going to be a lot of burning of pigs and the rest of it.  The issue here for the United States is that China has agreed to buy more soybeans, but with fewer pigs, they're not going to need soybeans as much as, you know, had anticipated.  So, this is going to be another one of those difficult issues between China and U.S.  Do they actually buy commodities in the amounts agreed?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Earlier, I spoke with New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew about this very issue.  Watch what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D), NEW JERSEY:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher.  There's no question -- when you're going to have a shortage of meat, and you're going to certainly going have a shortage of pork, and the prices are going up -- number one.  Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God, we have got a good Department of Ags to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the source that I was talking to last night said it's not just pork prices that are going up, it's going to ripple throughout meat.  It will go chicken prices, and meat prices as well, what do you think?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, certainly, because, you know, pork is such an important staple in China.  If you don't have it, you're going to have to eat something else.  And so, this is going to affect prices in Asia, and which means it's going to affect prices here.  It's going to have a knock-on effect, as I mentioned on soybeans and other commodities.  So, this is going to be felt worldwide.  Because I'm actually surprised that it's only 50 percent of the world's pork.  I think that it's actually higher --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's more than 50 percent.</p><p>CHANG:  I thought so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  How come nobody talking about the swine flu?  You don't see this reported anywhere?  I mean, I didn't.</p><p>CHANG:  This -- there was a little bit of reporting about two weeks ago, because the U.S. Department of Agriculture confiscated Chinese pork coming into U.S., which was diseased.  And so, that obviously was important to the A.G. markets here.  But you're right, for the most part, this is a story which no one is really talking about, and it does have effect through both the markets and the trade talks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm glad that we discussed it.  Gordon, it's good to see you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That you so much.  Gordon Chang joining us.  Coming up, startling new developments in the case against Boeing.  The very latest on the Ethiopian Airlines crash investigation, that's next.  And then, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars -- I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last night, and as we were about to start the call, 10 agents walked in, took him away.  More on the story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The 737 Max jet, the crash in Ethiopia last month reportedly had a damaged sensor.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Learning some new things here, Maria.  The angle of an attack sensor on the Boeing 737 Max was reportedly damaged during takeoff, by a foreign object or a bird.  That is according to ABC News right now.  Sources are saying that the sensor then sent false readings to the plane's anti-stall system, as the pilots tried desperately to keep it from pushing the plane nose down.  Meanwhile, the preliminary report on the crash from the Ethiopian government that came out this morning, is taking aim at Boeing, finding that the Ethiopian jet apparently nose-dived before it went down and the flight crew performed, according to this report, all the procedures recommended by Boeing, but still could not control that plane.</p><p>Well, Target raising its minimum wage.  The retailer announcing workers are going to now earn $13.00 an hour.  This starts in June, that is up from $12.00.  The move coming as retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers.  Target employs over 300,000 people right now.</p><p>Well, Google Assistant launching its first celebrity voice today, and here you go, it starts with singer, John legend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LEGEND, SINGER:  Whoa.  I am feeling this new voice.  You can find me on all kinds of devices: phones, Google Home, and if I'm lucky, in your heart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER).</p><p>CASONE:  You bet, you John!  The musician is going to give you the weather, maybe sing you happy birthday, tell you a joke.  This voice is only available for a limited time unfortunately.  Google says, there are going to be some more celebrity cameos, thanks to approve voice synthesizing technology.  I would love a little happy birthday from John Legend.  Bring it on!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that, yes!  Which celebrity voice do you guys want on your Google devices?  James, what about you?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I guess I'd go with Sinatra, If I had --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good one, good one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I would like Dolly Parton, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I'll go with Dolly.</p><p>ELMORE:  She's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Was I fortunate to meet her in the green room in this building a couple of years ago.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's a doll, huh!</p><p>FREEMAN:  She is just as wonderful, as you always hear about.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good to wake up with a voice like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but when she comes in -- she comes in, I don't care what time of day it is, Dolly Parton is always extremely professional.  And she looks you in the eye.  I think of -- like a lot of people can learn from that.  She's incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's real deal.  And now, she's going to the racetrack.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly, you got to watch Dolly.  I mean, she can dust anybody.  That's been clear with her long career.  But anyway, I'll do like, Gilbert Godfrey.  Remember Geico -- that was not Geico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The duck --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, the duck -- the duck fired him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'd be a good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would take Gilbert Godfrey.  Not just because it'll make you pay attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break, coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO when he was arrested again last night, the full story coming up.  Then, privacy alert; Facebook leaving hundreds of millions of user data exposed on public Amazon servers.  How the company is resolving that problem?  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are quiet this morning pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are waiting on any news out of the U.S.-China trade talks.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter this morning, writing this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade, but they are manageable.\"  He calls the U.S. trade issues China substantial and real.</p><p>Want to talk about, Jamie Dimon's letter and really the issues around China.  He's right, and of course, business wants to get into China, and wants the Chinese to open up its markets so that American businesses can sell to the 1.4 billion people.  That's one of the items on the list.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, and the question is, do they mean it this time?  Because what the messages out of China, the formal statements, the new policies, new laws, they -- they have -- announced within the last few months, are all about solving this problem.  Now, the question is are they going to mean it this time?  Are they actually going to allow U.S. businesses to operate there in a -- fair manner?  And we'll see when this trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's just one of several elements.  You've also got China buying more commodities from the U.S., and of course the big-ticket items, the I.P. theft, and the forced transfer of technology, Erin.</p><p>ELMORE:  Jamie Dimon is optimistic about China, but there are true concerns there, not just trade and soybeans.  This is about a lot more.  There are copyright infringement I.P. laws, there are no regulations in terms of business, there are no labor laws, there's no minimum wage.  They don't care about pollution.  So, there's a whole lot of issues going on in China, that are a lot bigger than, I think, people are getting credit for and there are concerns going into China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the president ought to really think about taking off the tariffs if he gets the deal he wants.  Because if you leave the tariffs in place, pending a check of China's behavior in the future, what did we really accomplish here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not getting the deal that he wants because it seems like he is willing to keep some tariffs in place.  I mean, that -- it seems like that's where this is going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is, clearly.  The steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place and you're worried about the state of the U.S. auto industry -- well, you just drove up their costs by billions of dollars, and you're still basically putting a thumb down on our auto industry and our manufactures, and trying to blame somebody else for it.  That's not -- that tariffs probably won't go away anytime soon.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which means that this drag on our economy may not be relieved by a deal if there's no relief from the essentially taxes on consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though, the economy seems to be holding up strongly in the face of weakness across the world.  The unemployment numbers will be out tomorrow.  We've got our jobs Friday tomorrow.  Joining us to preview that and talk about, investing today is Federated Investor Senior Equity Strategist, Linda Duessel.  Linda, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for weighing in here.  First, the employment, the jobs number tomorrow; how much is priced into the market, what are you expecting from the jobs' report out tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern?  We're expected to see the unemployment rate hold steady at 3.8 percent with 180,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of March.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTOR:  Well, it's a fully employed economy.  It doesn't seem to me that we should worry about it being too hot or even too cold.  So, that should really not be a market moving event, I wouldn't think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think is going to drive markets then?  How are you positioning clients?  Do you want to buy stocks here or pull back?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, we're bullish on the market.  We think the S&amp;P finishes the at 3100, and -- you know, that's based on just a reasonable earnings growth rate and the market deciding by the end of the year that actually, there's not an inflation problem, the fed could stay at bay for some time and we don't have to worry about unemployment rising dramatically and a recession on pace.  However, we just ran too fast.  Too fast on the way down last year the end, and too quickly on the way up this year.  The bull, which we are, would like nice a consolidation in here.</p><p>ELMORE:  Good morning, Linda, Erin Elmore here.  Born and raised in Pittsburgh, so love your great city.  But given this period of low volatility, it looks like Fed isn't going to raise interest rates anytime soon.  What sectors, do you think, are still undervalued, that you think have an opportunity for a run-up?</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, you know, we like growth, we believe it's a back half of the cycle, and so that would mean, you want to get growth, you want to get more reliable growth.  We really think that ought to have some have balance in your portfolio, because as we all know, there are a number of worries about trade around the globe, worries about China maybe falling into recession, worry about our own upcoming political season now, and what that might mean for the earnings outlooks.  A lot of exposure out there, the binary evens that we don't know how they'll work out.  And so, we think everybody ought to have some balance to their portfolio.  And that means, really, the high-quality dividend paid stocks.  I like it very much for income; they are not expensive right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, real quick before you go.  We've got the calendar one first-quarter earnings coming out beginning on Friday, with the banks, the 12th.  Would you put money to work in those areas ahead of earnings or are you expecting a tough earnings period here?  Real quick, Linda.</p><p>DUESSEL:  Well, I think that the earnings season to be tough in Q1 is already understood.  Nobody cares about that as much as the outlook into the next quarter and rest of the year, and financial is really looking expensive to us, and that's one of our over weights.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We leave it there.  Linda, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Linda Duessel joining us there from Federated.  Don't miss our \"Jobs in America\" special tomorrow morning.  It kicks off 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We are identifying where the jobs are in this economy right now, all hands-on deck for jobs in America tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m. right here.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting on the Mueller investigation.  Here's what he just said: \"According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian collusion hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive.  They should focus on legislation, or even better in investigation of how ridiculous collusion delusion got started.  So illegal,\" writes the president.</p><p>A quick break and then coming up next, the border battle: President Trump is preparing to visit southern border in California tomorrow as he eases back on the shutdown threats.  The economic impact of an immigration debate, next.  And then Facebook is under fire again; the networking giant leaving hundreds of millions of users' data exposed.  The company's efforts to fix the breach, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 4th.  Your top stories right now 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are searching for direction this morning, take a look, Dow Industrials now up 18 points, the S&amp;P 500 exactly where it closed yesterday, and the NASDAQ down 10 points right now.  Investors are waiting on some news out of the China trade talks, and they are thinking that it could be good news, and it looks like the two are very disclose.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, and we do see weakness there.  FT-100 down 37 points, a half of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 12, but the DAX Index is up 26 points, even though we did get weaker-than-expected economic data, factory orders down on -- in Germany this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, with the exception of Hong Kong, as you can see.</p><p>Well, he is back behind bars, former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn was rearrested last night moments before I was about to start an exclusive interview with him on the telephone.  The very latest coming up.  Privacy alert, Facebook reportedly leaving the data of millions of users exposed on Amazon servers.  How the company hopes to fix it.  Then the state of the housing market, it is getting a boost due to falling mortgage rates.  We take a closer look there later this hour.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the battle at the border.  President Trump headed to California, the California border tomorrow, as he eases back on the threat to shutdown border operations, this comes as Mexican officials are warning of port of entry delays, that's causing tens of millions of dollars in business losses.  Joining us now is the former CEO of McDonald's, former Famous Dave's Barbecue CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman, Ed Rensi.  Ed, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL:  Good morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As a business guy, what is the impact of the border closing?  Give us the news.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, it's going to be -- it's going to be significant.  I think Trump is using this as a negotiating ploy, frankly, because the impact would be staggering.  You know, you're talking about $12 billion worth of just food and produce coming across that border annually.  You look at all the car parts, medical supplies, and things of that nature, it's going to impact a lot of businesses in the United States.  I know they're working right now to try to minimize some of that stuff, but the reality is we got a sovereignty issue and our border is being penetrated.  If it were just people looking for an opportunity, that'd be one thing, but we got a lot of bad characters coming into this country and it's dangerous and we need to protect ourselves.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ed, hi.  James Freeman here at The Wall Street Journal, and kudos on naming your company FAT Brands.  Very strong.  I -- I'm wondering, as far as the -- that impact on the food service industry that you obviously focus on, we saw the news on avocados, the potential for the supply to run out within a few weeks if the Mexican imports are cut off, it goes beyond avocados and, you know, sort of millennial avocado toast jokes aside, how would the average diner notice?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, you're going to see shortages, and there'll be some things taken off the menu because you just can't get the product, whether it's avocados, or tomatoes, or whatever, these crops are going to come out of the ground and off the trees, and if they're not consumed, they're going to rot.  So, the short-term closing of the border will have a lot of long-term implications so we need to be careful about that.  I'm hopeful that this capitalist system of ours will put enough pressure on everybody in our house of -- the house of -- the Congress and Senate to start dealing with these immigrations issues in a more sensible way.</p><p>I hope it doesn't impact menu pricing, I hope it doesn't impact our ability to make money in restaurants, but it's going to be very, very difficult, to say the least, if that border closes.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi.  Good morning.  Erin Elmore here.  So shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to ask you about Chick-fil-A.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but two liberal cities just banned them from their airports -- San Antonio and Buffalo, given some of their social stances.  What's your take there and what advice would you give them?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, this country was founded on religious tolerance for a lot of great reasons and we have to respect each other and agree to disagree.  I get a little bit concerned when we're so intolerant about everything that we can't find common ground to solve problems and move forward.  I'm not going comment on what San Antonio does or what Chick-fil-A believes in, we all get to be who we are in this country and that's one of the great things in this country.  And I think some of these issues have taken on a preponderance of weight that's scary in a lot of ways and I hope they get it resolved sensibly and intelligently.  I think that we all, as citizens in this country, ought to have the right to exist and have a happy life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tell that to some of the academics out there, huh?  Ed, let me ask you about the minimum wage.  Target, the latest company to raise its minimum wage.  Employees going to now receive $13.00 an hour, a dollar increase from their last rates, which was, by the way, March of 2018.  The raise coming after --</p><p>RENSI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blew up Twitter over the minimum wage issue, comparing it to a $7.00 croissant.  Here's what she said, \"Croissants at LaGuardia are going for $7.00 apiece, yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal dedicated human labor for $15.00 is too expensive.\"  She tweeted it on April Fools' Day but it was no joke.  Your reaction.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I wouldn't pay $7.00 for a croissant no matter where --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are not going to buy.</p><p>RENSI:  - I bought it, whether it's Paris or anywhere else, but the reality of it is she's making a statement about the value of workers and the value of products, and I don't disagree.  I think the best system is a capitalist system that allows all wages to seek a market level, and I think Target's move is simply a reflection of the fact that we're near full-employment, and it is extremely difficult to get employees to work.  I've talked to multiple -- I had dinner with a bunch of McDonald's franchisees the other night, and they are struggling to find employees at any price.  I see some of them are $16.00, $17.00 an hour and still can't find employees.  So, let the free market determine the wage, and don't buy $7.00 croissants.  That's a bad idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, time and again, Ed, it's Dagen McDowell, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complains about the Flint water crisis.  She -- she's upset about children having asthma in the South Bronx, she's upset about a $7.00 croissant.  I'm not saying that those are on the same level of rage from her.  However, she points to where the government fails the citizens, where the government is the problem, not the solution.  Whether it's the City of New York --</p><p>RENSI:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a socialist city --</p><p>ELMORE:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- doesn't take care of its residents, can't basically help children with asthma despite a fully socialized medical system in this city, or the $7.00 croissant at LaGuardia.  Again, those rents are high because it's essentially controlled by the government.</p><p>RENSI:  A government is extremely inefficient and they ought to get out of business altogether.  You look at the Housing Authority in New York City and tens of thousands of apartments that have lead paint in them, ceilings falling down, no boilers, government is inefficient, and de Blasio is grossly underperforming what his responsibilities are.  And look at that Flint water crisis, they know what the solution is.  They need to put phosphate in the water to trap all lead, they need to get rid of all the lead pipes, they have had multiple millions of dollars spent, it's grossly inefficient, and they're not solving the problem.  I don't get it.  They ought to about thrown out in the next election, all of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Ed, let me -- let me end on this China story, because Cornerstone Macro, which I think is one of the best research shops out there, is talking about the reports yesterday that -- are talking about a deal between the U.S. and China, which would give Beijing until 2025 to meet the commitments on commodity purchases and allow U.S. firms to wholly own enterprises in China.  They think it's a weak deal and they think that this deal is a deal that Robert Lighthizer is likely to oppose privately.  It could happen because Trump wants a deal but there's a real chance they say it does not happen, because this is a weak deal.  What do you think?  Do you think a deal happens with China or not?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I think some kind of deal will likely happen, but if it's not a good deal, there'll be enough public opinion from businesspeople, and institutions of finance, that we'll soon know what the deal really looks like.  I'm very concerned about China because they want to dominate the globe as the number one entity on the planet.  It's dangerous.  They're a totalitarian system of government.  You look at the swine flu problem they've got, they consume a lot of pork, they export a lot of pork, that swine flu epidemic could wipe out their entire pork crop.  They have no means of getting rid of a hundred million hogs, they own one of the largest hog producers in the United States.  Those kinds of issues, and intellectual property theft.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RENSI:  These are really significant issues that are going to impact us for the next hundred years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've been focusing on the swine flu this morning.  You're not hearing that anywhere in the media, a hundred million pigs they have to dispose of, a hundred million dead pigs.  It pretty extraordinary, Ed.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, historically, what they have done is they dumped them in the river --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RENSI:  -- dumped them in the ocean and let God take them away, that's not going to work anymore because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>RENSI:  -- the numbers are too staggering.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a hundred million.</p><p>RENSI:  But it point -- it points out this extreme weakness of a government that functions the way they function.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ed, good to see you.</p><p>RENSI:  That problem is solvable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, Ed.  We will continue the conversation.  Thanks so much.  We will see you soon.  Ed Rensi joining us.  Coming up, home buying heats up, a wave of strong housing data shapes up the market to be the best in years.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then Carlos Ghosn back behind bars.  I was about to start an exclusive interview with him last might when 10 agents walked in his house and took him away.  I'll share the full story later this hour.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Hey, guys.  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Volvo open hit top gear in Charleston, South Carolina Wednesday, but it was a mixed day for the red, white, and blue.  Taylor Townsend enjoyed one of the biggest wins of her career, as took out Julia Gorges to reach the third round.  The American closing out the number seven seed in the second set breaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAYLOR TOWNSEND, TENNIS PLAYER:  Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and just really go after it.  I mean I think sometimes you can play a little tentatively, but I just tried to go for it and then whatever happened, happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  The hometown favorite, Shelby Rogers, is out.  She went down to former French Open Champion, Jelena Ostapenko.  The Latvian fighting back from 5-1 down in the decider to put the win in the books to move on.

I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New mortgages soaring as loan rates hit 15-month lows.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to talk more about that.  Stuart Varney, good to see you, Stu.  Good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  You, too, Maria.  You might call this the stealth stimulus?  Maybe.  You got four percent mortgages, we got the latest mortgage numbers today in about one hour's time, could be still at four percent, as what I'm expecting, and last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association says the refi activity went up 36 percent.  Now that's a real shot in the arm for the housing industry and for real estate generally.  I think it's a shot in the arm for the economy.  If you got four percent mortgages, and what six months, seven months ago, we were talking about five percent mortgages.  I think you've got a drop here and I think that really helps everyone.</p><p>And frankly, I'm surprised at how rate-sensitive people are.  A jump of 36 percent in refi activity just because mortgages go from 4.25 percent down to four percent even?  I didn't realize that people were so rate-sensitive --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- and so pent up with demand to get in at a lower rate, but they are, and I think that's a shot in the arm for everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  And even on this program, Stu, we've heard a couple of people says that there are now green suits in housing because of --</p><p>VARNEY:  Remember that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, from way back when, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're singing it.  We're seeing it and housing, Stu.  I know more you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.  Got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his fantastic panel after the program.  But first, President Trump just tweeted again, he really just said, \"There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy.  This is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country,\" writes the President.  Coming up, Carlos Ghosn back behind bars as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the former Nissan CEO, he was taken away to the prosecutor's office.  I'm sharing the full story coming up.</p><p>Then privacy alert, Facebook leaves hundreds of millions of users data unprotected.  The company's efforts to fix the situation coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook under fire again, millions of users' information left exposed on a public server.  Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Hey, that's right, Maria.  Amazing story here -- Facebook two-third party Facebook app level first.  Storing user data on Amazon servers in a way that allowed them to be downloaded by the public.  The information hiding in plain sight.  Up guard, a cybersecurity firm making this information public.  The two offenders here, Cultural Collective, this is a Mexico City-based digital platform with 45 million followers.  They openly stored records on 540 million people.</p><p>At the pool, this is a defunct app.  They stored information including names, passwords, e-mail addresses on 22,000, this is the people kind of information that used to be freely available, and Facebook itself has tried to crack down on it.  Meanwhile, Guggenheim has raised its rating to a buy and privacy concerns here remain.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All, right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS:  Welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, we're going to talk about what's going on in Japan.  Carlos Ghosn is back behind bars, I'm going to tell you all about it.  The details, as I was about to start an exclusive interview with the Former CEO last night when he was arrested.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's end where we began the program.  Japanese authorities rearrested former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn facing new chargers, financial misconduct.  He's denying any wrongdoing.  Saying in a statement, \"My arrest this morning is outrageous in arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals to -- at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I'm innocent of these groundless charges and accusations.\"</p><p>It was a dramatic evening.  I was back at work last night at about 5:30 p.m. because we were about to do an exclusive interview.  He was going to call into the show and I was going to bring you that interview this morning.  As we were about to get started, he was calling into the show.  Ten agents burst it into his apartment and put him in a room and talk to him and then took him away.  They then -- they were both still in their pajamas, Carlos and his wife, Carole.  They then were voluntarily forcing Carole Ghosn to answer questions.</p><p>His wife, she said, after the agents left, \"I wanted to use the bathroom.  The officer entered the bathroom with me and did the body check.  They kept the bathroom door open while I used the bathroom.\"  A female prosecutor stayed in the shower with Carole while she showered.  They are trying to break him.  The whole point here is to get Carlos Ghosn to admit to something.  He remains saying he's innocent.  Guys.</p><p>ELMORE:  Japan has a 99 percent conviction rate, so this looks really bad for Ghosn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the prosecution has not presented any evidence, eventually we'll hear it.  We would hope -- well, eventually, we would hope to hear his side of the story as well.  Renault has raised questions about his expenses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  OK.  So that -- you're saying that Renault did their own investigation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we will keep following this.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  I will.</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 4, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 040402cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Tesla's Troubles; E-Cigarette Crackdown; College Admissions Scandal; Brexit Debate; President Donald Trump to Visit the Border Wall; Interview with Rep.

This after markets were little changed yesterday.  The Nasdaq was the top performer on the day yesterday.  It was up two-thirds of 1 percent, 46 points higher.  The other major indices higher but just fractionally.  Dow Industrials up about 39 points yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the story and it is mixed.  FT 100 down 30 points.  CAC 40 in Paris down 9 points.  But the DAX index in Germany up 26.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher as you can see here with the exception of Hong Kong.</p><p>We are waiting on the jobs report.  It's jobs Friday tomorrow, that may very well be a market mover.</p><p>Cracking down on e-cigarettes.  The FDA is warning of serious health concerns after some users are reporting they're getting seizures after vaping.</p><p>The college admissions scandal continues.  Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman appearing in a Boston court yesterday, after they signed autographs outside.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Plus the vests take over Wall Street.  But now the company behind them, Patagonia, is saying no more.  Wait until you hear that story.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Republican strategist Erin Elmore.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>Jamie Dimon has his annual letter out.  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase out with his annual letter.  And he writes this, \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.</p><p>The letter has become something that Jamie Dimon is real proud of, you know, as he takes a whack at policy issues and talks about concerns for the country, not just JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes.  I think China obviously the big issue on the table.  I think he's speaking for the business community, where they don't like tariffs but they recognize that the game in China is not fair to foreign companies.  It's not fair on intellectual property, et cetera.</p><p>Larger policy points in there, I think some of them are laudable.  But I don't like the idea that businesses have a sort of a social responsibility to advocate for different public policies.  I think the job of a bank, for example, and his bank does it very well, is to fund businesses, allow companies to grow, allow people to have the financial services and I think that's a great service.  You don't need to be involved in public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This reads like a 10-point plan for a man who is running for the nomination of some party.  I don't know which party it is.</p><p>But he talks about infrastructure spending and the infrastructure plan to improve our highways and such.  That is the role of the government, how to pay for it is the question.  Also things like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Education.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- education.  Those are the big l policy issues.  I mean, he's kind of -- again, tell us something we don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He says ten ways to address what's holding back growth and opportunity, education, healthcare costs, regulatory reform, infrastructure, tax system, litigation reform, immigration reform, mortgage reform, labor market, budgeting and planning.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Jamie Dimon, 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, he said he's not going to run.</p><p>ELMORE:  No, no.  Definitely not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's not woke enough, I don't think, to certainly win the Democratic nomination and you already got like a Howard Schultz possibly running as an independent candidate.  I wasn't suggesting that.  I'm just saying it reads like a policy platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  You're absolutely right.  But I will say this, he's probably going to be getting some good news recently -- good news in the near term on China because the Chinese are agreeing to open up their markets, particularly to financial services.</p><p>UBS was the first bank to get an opportunity to own a bank out and out, 51 percent.  But it looks like financial services are going to be the first industry that really gets a shot to sell to the 1.4 billion people in China, which is a big opportunity.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And if you look at what the Chinese have said recently, it sounds like reform.  Obviously, there's this question, and this is sort of the sticking point in the trade negotiations right now, what is the enforcement mechanism?  When do you take the tariffs off?  How do you punish if they're not following the deal.</p><p>I think on the U.S. side, they are convinced that Liu He is a genuine reformer.  He wants to move the Chinese economy toward open markets, the rule of law, respect for property.  Can he sell that to Xi Jinping who is really an old-fashioned communist.  And we'll hear from Gordon Chang who obviously covers this extremely well but covers this extremely well.  But that's really the he question, I think is can He sell that reform opportunity back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm expecting that meeting between the President and Xi Jinping in May, early May, is the guidance that I'm getting in terms of the meeting in Mar-a-Lago -- that must mean reform that they are really down to the final items as we told you yesterday actually.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we've got a great show.</p><p>Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is here.  He'll be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and House agriculture committee member Jeff Van Drew.  We'll get both of their ideas.</p><p>Plus the author of \"The Coming Collapse Of China\", Gordon Chang is with us to talk about where we are in that deal.  And former McDonald's CEO, and Fat Brands international chairman Ed Rensi joining is us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Now to the Securities and Exchange Commission versus Elon Musk, the Tesla chief headed to court today over his controversial tweets that have triggered a legal t battle between his company and the SEC.   A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the agency which is the court to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement.</p><p>Joining us now is ARK investment analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha Keeney.  Tasha it's god to see you.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ARK INVESTMENT ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>Have you been trading or recommending this stock in light of all this -- Tesla?</p><p>KEENEY:  In light of the SEC Investigation?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Keeney:  Well, we know -- we don't try to predict legal outcomes.  We certainly don't know.  But you know, Dagen I heard you say earlier, you don't think that he'll be removed as CEO.  That's really most important to us.  We want him to stay at the helm of the company.  Especially if Tesla is still reaching for autonomy with its vehicles which what we think the largest market opportunity ahead of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Think about the outrage about that, if a federal judge because of a tweet -- a tweet violates a settlement with a securities regulator which has no really criminal authority over companies, it has -- it can file civil cases, having a judge remove a CEO for a tweet ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want to remove President Trump for his lies; for his tweets.</p><p>ELMORE:  And Tasha How do you manage your expectations given the fact that Elon Musk has such volatility in his behavior?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, we look at Musk really as a visionary.  He's accomplished the impossible.  I mean he's changing the face of the auto industry.  So there's a lot of transparency in what he does because he uses Twitter.</p><p>And he has made mistakes in the past and he's admitted those and paid for those mistakes.</p><p>You know, I think, again, for the long term goal of the company in terms of getting to full autonomy, being a leader in electric vehicles, he seems to have a accomplished that.  We're happy so far with how things are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company's new vehicle deliveries plummeted 31 percent in the first quarter.  Tesla is citing challenges associated with taking the Model 3 overseas for the first time.  How are they going to deal with this?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know,  it think there's too much focus on deliveries.  Again, with an innovative company like this you have to look at the long-term picture.  So if Tesla's late by say a month or what have you on those numbers -- I mean, are they -- it's still the best selling mid-size premium sedan.  I mean there's no demand issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: but again but it doers reflect and the \"Wall Street Journal\" writes about this in its analysis today.</p><p>\"Tesla has trouble planning.  And if you're going to be in the manufacturing business, you really need to learn how to cross your t's and dot your i's so-to-speak.  Because Tesla produced 22 percent more cars than it was able to deliver in the first quarter.  This shows in part a logistics problem.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to hurt income --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's more likely but Elon Musk kind -- and Tasha can attack about this.   Elon Musk kind of forecast several weeks ago -- we were talking, remember about the debt payment.  It was really about him saying that the company might not be profitable in the first quarter after two straight quarters of producing a profit because of some of the issues.</p><p>And in part, they are losing that tax credit as well.  It was at $7,500.  Now it's essentially been cut in half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stock is down 8 percent right now.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  Exactly.  So I think -- well, so one, in terms of profitability, I think so Tesla said they have enough cash on-hand at the end of the quarter and I think in general with the delivery figures, I mean, have you to ask yourself, are these logistic challenges going to kill the company?  No.  You know.</p><p>If you're a long-term investor, I don't think this should phase you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wanted to ask about the tweets.  Obviously this is a mechanism to speak to the markets and the company has said that, but people just like with the president, they argue are the tweets critical to his success or is he hurting himself with tweets.</p><p>I wonder how you view the Musk communications generally, whether it's Twitter, whether it's going on pod casts and smoking weed -- is this part of the brand and part of the genius or is it a downside and you wish he would stop talking?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, again, as I said earlier, with Twitter we get a lot of transparency.  And you don't get that with other CEOs.  So I think in a lot of ways investors, this gives us more information.  Now, sometimes he does unpredictable things like the 420 but in general, you know, 420 tweet.</p><p>In general, again, we see the board supporting Musk which is really important for an innovative company like Tesla.  And, you know, as we look forward as the auto industry transitions to electric autonomous vehicles, Tesla's years ahead of the competition.</p><p>And so we don't think that little blips like this are going to sort of affect that competitive advantage that Tesla's built in terms of batteries, in terms of autonomous hardware and in terms of autonomous data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you don't even need to look ahead to autonomous vehicles.  I had this discussion with someone I'm very close to over the weekend who works in Silicon Valley.  Every other automaker, even luxury automakers in Germany, Japanese and American -- they are awful at software.</p><p>There is no other car and no other car company that compares to a Tesla.  We all as drivers and consumers ought to be rooting for this company.  You don't have to own stock in it but you ought to be rooting for them because hopefully all these other automakers will realize oh, our software stinks.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  And automakers really haven't even owned that part of the supply chain.  The software side of things.  They're bringing in all of these components from different suppliers and Tesla's vertically integrated.</p><p>So this is a huge challenge to the traditional companies.  And I mean if you don't -- just take one thing over the air updates.  the car gets better overnight.  Why haven't other automakers been able to do this?  I mean it's ridiculous that Tesla's actually been doing this for years now.  And no one has caught up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they're dug in and they literally don't know now to run a car company in the new century.  That's literally what these companies look like.</p><p>If you -- I'm surprised.  And I'm surprised that Apple and Google haven't done more to try and manufacture a car or produce software for one.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How secured is Tesla's funding?</p><p>Keeney:  So, you know, I think in general if we look at funding for Tesla, ok, so say if you were worried about cash, we actually as investors would be ok with an equity dilution because we just want them to get as many cars on the road as possible.  Each of the cars acts like a mini R&amp;D center.  It collects data for Tesla and it gets it toward that vision of full autonomy because Machine learning improves with the more data you feed it.</p><p>So we're actually factoring in a $10 billion to $20 billion equity dilution over the next five years.  And again, we would be ok with that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  How soon do they need to raise more capital?</p><p>KEENEY:  So you know they've again, they said that they're ok with cash at the end of the quarter.  So no immediate expectations for that to happen.  Now, if things were to change which we certainly think they could, again, that would be ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just to be clear, the stock is down almost 9 percent right now.  Would you buy it here?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, I can't say whether or not we would buy or sell but you know, again, our long term visit .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to tell clients something, right?</p><p>KEENEY:  Well, you know, the market hasn't opened yet.  But the long-term vision for Tesla has not changed.</p><p>I mean we still think they're the largest producer of batteries in the world.  They're the only company that's collecting data off its customer cars on the road, we've seen every other company that's working on autonomous driving have issues, Waymo is having technical issues, the commercial launch was much watered down than what se expected.</p><p>I mean Tesla could launch a fully autonomous car in the next couple of years and then they're really going to run away from the competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I still think he's acted like a jerk in the past but again, like I said everybody in this country ought to be rooting for the success of this company in one way shape or form because it is 's the way of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tasha -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Tasha Keeney, ARK Investment.</p><p>Coming up a major e-cigarettes warning this morning, dozens of users reporting to the FDA that they're suffering features.  The health risk around vaping coming up.</p><p>And then changing the Wall Street\" uniform.  Patagonia takes a stand when it comes to which companies wear its clothes.  Stay with us.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A new potential health risk for e-cigarette users.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Pretty serious one, Maria.</p><p>The Food and Drug administration is revealing about three dozen reports of seizures among e-cigarette users, mainly younger people.  Nicotine poisoning is believed to cause seizures and even brain injury.  Last month the FDA outlined new restrictions on sales of most flavored e-cigs to fight underage use of them.</p><p>Well, billionaire/investor, Carl Icahn reportedly sold his stake in Lyft to fellow billionaire, George Soros before the company's IPO last week.  Sources telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Icahn held about a 2.7 percent stake in Lyft which was valued at about $550 million -- that's the IPO price.</p><p>It is not known why Icahn sold his stake or how much Soros paid for it.  Lyft is up about a fraction of a percent this morning.</p><p>Three global automakers teaming up to create safety standards for self-driving cars.  Ford, GM and Toyota plan to set up the automated vehicle safety consortium, focusing on building a safety framework for autonomous vehicles.  Self-driving cars have come under increased scrutiny since, of course, the fatal crash of an Uber test vehicle last year.  The Ford, GM, Toyota initiative is notable because it involves large car makers but no technology firms who probably will want to weigh in on any new rules.</p><p>And those are your headlines -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  all right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the delay in the U.K., trying to avoid a no deal exit from the European Union.  British lawmakers are now looking for another deadline extension.  We've got the details out of London coming up.  then the college admissions scandal, Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman facing a judge.  The courtroom drama coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  British lawmakers are voting to force prime minister Theresa May to ask the E.U. for another extension to exit the European Union.</p><p>Ashley Webster with the very latest right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We go around and around and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Round and round and round.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- and around we go.  Nothing much as changes other than yes there is a bill that whisked it went through the House of commons yesterday, basically telling Theresa May that she must go to The European Union and ask for an extension which, by the way, the new deadline is a week from tomorrow.</p><p>That went through the House of commons.  It's now in the House of Lords.  It's kind of like the House and the Senate in the U.K.</p><p>Generally nothing of interest ever happens in the House of Lords so this is ground-breaking by itself, that they're actually debating this issue in the House of Lords and doing it quickly.  Nothing quickly happens in the House of Lords.</p><p>And now there's a belief that some conservatives in the House of Lords are so upset with this whole process they may filibuster.  They may talk for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to try to prevent this from going through.</p><p>The bottom line ok, Prime Minister go ask for another deadline from the E.U. It doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.  for the an tension, doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.</p><p>What's interesting is this whole affair has not really moved forward in three years.  You can't come to a majority, a consensus on what the plan is to get the heck out of the E.U.</p><p>What's interesting though is there's a new poll out in the U.K., that says 83 percent of U.K. citizens, sick of talking about Brexit, 64 percent believe it's harmful to their mental health.</p><p>I think we can all agree with that.  But it's certainly --</p><p>And another interesting angle to this, Maria and gang, there are 10,000 riot police that have been undergoing extensive training in the last couple of weeks.  They are ready to deploy in a heartbeat.  That doesn't mean to say they're going to be needed but there has been a ramping up of emotions</p><p>The number of crimes related to Brexit have doubled in the last two weeks.  Not a huge amount but there are incidents where harsh rhetoric is now being translated into actual action.  And there's actual a concern if this continues to drag on and Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British people in that referendum, that things could spill on the streets.</p><p>There are 10,000 riot troops ready to go.  It's a little .   And there's a concern if this continues to drag on and the Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British riot troops ready to go.</p><p>It's a little bit of a scare thing.  Haven't been used and so far, it's been pretty civil, I have to say.  But there's no doubt tensions and emotions are frayed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are always people looking for a reason to loot, aren't they?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly in France.  There's always a small group of anarchists who will jump onto any cause just so they can smash up some shops.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And get what?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Get some free jeans.  Get free stuff.  There's always that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Ashley's -- East London accent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes. But there are people who would jump on any cause just to create problems.  So there is that kind of lurking in the background.</p><p>Bottom line is can Theresa May survive this?  Who knows?  Who would want her job right now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But if she cuts a deal with the Labour Party --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p>FREEMAN:  this is going to be either no Brexit or something that's VERY close to no Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It's going to be a very soft Brexit.  And you know, will Corbyn insist on a second referendum, no matter what deal they make, the choice going back to the people, saying this is the deal we've got.</p><p>Vote for this or we forget the whole thing and stay in Europe.  That could be the next move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will that do to markets.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Uncertainties, sterling ha taken another hit.  We know  that it's funny, you know the economic news out of Europe, German manufacturing again came out really poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Italy and Germany GDP were cut.</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is not a good time economically for the E.U. and certainly the U.K. slowed down.  None of this is good because of the uncertainty.  Businesses aren't spending.  Businesses don't know what to do, especially if you have a lot of exposure to the continent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This referendum the people voted for -- they voted for Brexit --</p><p>WEBSTER:  52 to 48 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is basically being ignored on the installment plan, by the politicians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.  It was always 70 something percent of MPs who voted to remain and there's this strong belief that they would do anything they can to prevent it from happening. And one way to do that is to drag it out, get the U.K. involved in the European parliament elections coming up in May.  They do that this thing gets pushed further and further and further down the line.  And that happens is no Brexit.  That is the fear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all having an impact across the world.  I'm glad you mentioned the factory orders report out of Germany because you're the Eurozone economic numbers do not look good.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This morning the GDP expectations for Italy and Germany were cut again.  They're lucky to get 1 percent growth if at all in the Eurozone.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.  Completely stagnant.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That has to hit the U.S. at some point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course it does.  And you know, no matter what you think of the E.U. it's a huge trading bloc.  It is enormous and there's a lot of business done between the U.S. and the E.U. So it is going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to say, meantime you have political candidates here in the United States pointing to Europe as kind of the gold standard.  Yes, their economy can't grow.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is what socialism gets you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This could be an upside for us.  I was talking to one European BANK and he was saying this all of this debate and concern and uncertainty helps New York remain the world's financial center.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It does.  It's the only game in town.  And where are you going to put your money right now?  U.S. equities look pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Are American businesses, JPMorgans of the world, have they made a plan to stay in the U.K. or move some of their people to Germany?  What's the story.</p><p>WEBSTER:  There have been a lot of movement.  Bank of America moved a lot of its employees out of the -- out of London and to Dublin, to Ireland because their because they'll remain in the E.U.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I THINK There's no obvious competitor in Europe, Dublin, Frankfurt maybe has an argument, but I think London remains the European financial center because of the tradition, rule of law, people want to operate there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Certainly hope so.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that's probably true regardless of what the is.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  I think you're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ashley -- great stuff.

Griff, good morning.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We just got some numbers here in the Rio Grande Valley.  I'm just steps from the border here.  That there were over 1,100 apprehensions of illegal crossers last night.  That is the 13th day of more than a thousand apprehensions that they're having in this surge of migrants, many of them family units.  We encountered more than 180 when we spent all day with the border patrol out on watch.  But they don't all surrender peacefully seeking asylum, sometimes they seek to evade being caught.  And we went into the sticks with them.  It's tough work.  Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  It's unbelievably difficult terrain.  I'm cut, my gloves torn.  This man rushing through here and we found a group, this is the first one we found, just nothing but thorns, bushes, bugs, snakes, spiders.</p><p>This is a spotlight.  You can see (INAUDIBLE), there they are.  They've got two more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) they tried to run.  This one right here was hiding underneath this brush to my left and this one right here just got up from the brush and took off running south but I was able to get him before he went got away.</p><p>JENKINS:  This is the brush underneath here, right where I am, where the last illegal crosser was laid down and Herman had to crawl in like this and go through these bushes and thorns.  It's just treacherous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  And that is not an extraordinary night by any stretch.  That's what they go through every night here.  Also folks are worried about this border closing.</p><p>As you know, Maria, Mexico is Texas' biggest trade partner to the tune of $187 billion.  We wait to see what happens as DHS Secretary Nielsen visits Arizona today, the president to California tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, it really looks like a crisis there, Griff.  Thank you.  Griff Jenkins joining us in McAllen this morning.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to close the southern border all together.  Mexican officials along the border are warning a port of entry delays are already causing tens of millions of dollars in losses for companies that do business along the border.  White House Economic director Larry Kudlow said that there's a way to keep freight lanes open should the border close.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE:  But regarding the economic impact of closing the border, which has not -- the president has not made a decision yet, as you know, I'm not aware that he has, one area we've explored is to try to keep the freight lanes open.  The truck lanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is congressman and House Agricultural Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Thanks, and it's always a pleasure to be here with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your reaction to this news this morning.  We're seeing the lines get longer.  We're seeing a lot of worry over the threat that the president could close the border.  How do you see it?</p><p>VAN DREW:  I sure -- I certainly hope he doesn't have to close the border.  I wouldn't want to see that.  It's obviously not good for business, it's not good for the economy.  So I'm hopeful that we can work this out.</p><p>Yet another example, and I know I drive it over and over again, but where we just need to have -- you know, more conversation, more bipartisanship.  We really need to do more here at the border to try to straighten this out.  If we can get the border under control, then we won't have the problem at the ports of entry with moving things through quickly enough.  And that's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, congressman, this is one of those examples of there are real issues happening in the country and in the world and instead, we have been focused in the last two years on this collusion narrative.  I know that you have come to Washington to get things done.  How are you dealing with your colleagues that seem to only want to take down Donald Trump and have ignored all of the issues going on that affect the American people?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I had a serious conversation with some of them just last night where we sat around a table and talked about it and I agree with exactly what you're saying.  I want to get things done.  People don't even realize at this point the bills that you hear about moving through the House of Representatives.  Most of them, the vast majority of them are not going anywhere.  They're going to get stopped at the senate, because, again, we're not having that conversation.  They're not moving through and becoming law.</p><p>So, I think at so many levels we need to take care of the issues that are real, whether it's Social Security, Medicare, healthcare, making sure that our veterans are taken care of.  I can go through an entire list for about 10 minutes of things that we need to do.  We need to get past this other part.</p><p>So, we're going to get the report.  Let's get the report, get as much that -- of it that is legal, and I want to emphasize that, that we legally can get, take a look at it.  If there's something there, deal with it.  If there's nothing there, that is horrendous, let's move on.  Let's get laws passed that -- you know, really can make a difference.  Let's get our business sector going even better.  Let's take care of the border issues so that we don't have what's now -- was first just a crisis of safety, is now also a humanitarian crisis and a business crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes for sure.  Then there's China and this of course impacts your constituents being on the Agricultural Committee.  I want to ask you about what's going on in China because I heard a story last night which really concerned me.  There is a swine flu outbreak in China, this deadly virus said to be spreading throughout the country, affecting a shocking number of pigs.  China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork.  But apparently 20 percent of the pigs are sick from this swine flu and they've got a hundred million pigs to dispose of.  Dead pigs.</p><p>In the past they would put the pigs in the -- in the ocean and just leave it.  But there are literally a hundred million dead pigs in China.  Have you heard about this?  Do you think there's going to be an impact to our agriculture?  Some people expect that this situation is going to ripple through different meats, chicken and steak, in terms of prices.  It's going to push all prices higher.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher, there's no question.  When -- you're going to have a shortage of meat and you're going to certainly going to have a shortage of pork and the prices are going to go up, number one.</p><p>Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God we have got a good Department of AGs to make sure that we keep everything safe over here.  Just to -- you know, arrest everybody's fears, this is nothing that you or I can catch from eating something.  This is something that goes from animal to animal through a variety of ways, sometimes when they eat waste that is infected from the flies and the transient insects that move around.  But it's a serious issue.  It's another serious issue.  It's another economic issue.  These are the types of issues that government should be working on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting out of a China deal?  The president is expected to tell us later today when he will meet President Xi in Mar-a-Lago.  I'm thinking -- I'm hearing it's either end of April, but likely -- more likely the beginning of May.  Do you think the U.S. is going to be able to get an enforcement mechanism in there to ensure that the Chinese do not steal intellectual property from America?</p><p>VAN DREW:  It may not be as good as we would want, but it's got to be better than it is.  Because it's something we can't put up with anymore.  And the stealing of intellectual property, the tampering with their monetary system as you know and many of the other things that they do are things that we just can't tolerate.  I think there's truth to those who say that for too long China has had the better end of the deal and I think we have to protect our American interest.</p><p>So I think this, again, is another very, very important issue that we've got to work on.  I think we're going to do better.  I believe we're going to do better.  But you know, Maria, this is going to be some hard, tough negotiating that's going to take place.  We're not playing with amateurs here.  These folks are serious.  And they're serious about being the new number one in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And they're looking long term but I think during the whole -- you know, Mueller report drama, the Chinese were questioning if they're even going to have to deal with Donald Trump.  Now after we know officially no collusion, the Chinese are saying we might have to deal with this guy for another eight years.  It just also underlines how irresponsible there was -- it was out there, the media, the Democrats, you know, parading around with this collusion story, basically giving an upper hand to the Chinese while he's trying to do a deal with them.</p><p>You mentioned the Mueller report a moment ago.  It's going to come out.  The Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 to subpoena the entire report.  Some members of the special counsel team reportedly saying that the results are more damaging to President Trump than Attorney General William Barr led on, that's coming from the New York Times today, the New York Times is clinging to this narrative, obviously.  Would the A.G. hide something?  I mean, would the new A.G. hide something in the Mueller report?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, call me naive, but I really believe in the system of law.  And I believe he wants to ensure to keep his good name, so I believe he's going to release what is supposed to be released.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the grand jury testimony, right, though?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Correct.  He can't release that.  That's by law.  But those areas where we're not going to hurt people, not the grand jury testimony, not something obviously that's confidential for certain reasons but the majority of it, a good piece of that report could be released.</p><p>And if that's true, then that will come out.  I'm one -- let me say this, you know, I'm a Democrat.  But frankly, I was glad when it seems to be that there might not be much there because it's important that we can move forward for the next year and-a-half that our president can be effective.  We're going to have an election, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  When we have that election, we can hash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let the voters decide.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Exactly.  Let the voters decide.  Let's hash this out.  Let's have the big, grand argument that everybody wants to have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Right now is the time to accomplish goals and get things done.  And the China deal is an example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one thing that the voters are going to decide on -- one thing that the voters are going to decide on are some of these radical ideas, congressman.  I mean, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill for CEOs to receive jail time after data breaches.  Warren treated this yesterday, today I'm proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families.  Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you'll go to jail.  She wants to make it easier for CEOs to go to jail, congressman.  What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW:  Well, I think if they've done something truly wrong, truly hurtful and truly illegal, then there can be some truth to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VAN DREW:  But I don't necessarily love a full-fledged attack that's occurring in certain sectors on business in general.  That business is bad, that the capitalistic system is bad, that we should change the whole playing field.  You know, I've said this to you before I'm a capitalist.  I'm proud to be a capitalist.  I'm a capitalist and I like to -- you know, have a little phone that I'm a compassionate capitalist.  But that -- I mean that for real that -- you know, there is a place for government.  We want to make sure people don't fall through the cracks.  This is not just Laissez-faire capitalism.</p><p>However, we want to make sure that this economic engine that is taking so many of us to such good places in so many ways is even expanded more and even takes more of us and enables us to live the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well-said, congressman.  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VAN DREW:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Van Drew.</p><p>Coming up, the college admissions scandal is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Constellation Brands out with earnings right now.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We've got the numbers, Maria.  Constellation Brands reporting better than expected results for Q4.  The company posting adjusted profit of a $1.84 a share, revenue of $1.8 billion.  The company also selling about 30 of its lower priced wine brands to E. &amp; J. Gallo for $1.7 billion.  Some of the names, Clos du Bois, Mark West wines and several others.  Shares of Constellation Brands higher in the premarket.</p><p>All right.  Well, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin appearing for the first time in federal court in Boston over the college admissions scandal.  Both are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.  Prosecutors reportedly asking for jail time for everyone charged in the case.  Now the actresses have forfeited their passports.  Loughlin, we should ask, stopped to sign autographs outside of the courthouse after her appearance, Aunt Becky fans in Boston yesterday.</p><p>All right, Patagonia no longer selling its popular vest through corporate sales programs.  These vests with finance from logos on them , kind of a wardrobe staple on Wall Street if you're a New Yorker, especially for those workers that trade in those formal suits for that more casual look for the trading floor.  Patagonia says it wants to add new businesses to its client list, ones that quote, meet certain environmental, social and transparency standards.  The company adding existing corporate customers can remain in the program.  OK, way to make your views there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  Patagonia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's too much.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, real estate is heating up.  Investors are finding it's the perfect time to make a buck in the housing market.  Details on the making -- the money making opportunity rather.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeted on the GOP.  Here's what the president writes, the Republican Party is the party of the American dream.</p><p>Well, let's talk about that because spring has sprung for potential home buyers, falling rates and increased inventory pushing a buyer's market.  Joining us now to give us the state of business is Dolly Lenz Real Estate co-founder, Dolly Lenz and Dolly Lenz Real Estate managing director, Jenny Lenz.  Jenny and Dolly, it is good to see you both.</p><p>DOLLY LENZ, CO-FOUNDER, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  You too.</p><p>JENNY LENZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Asses the market for us, what are you expecting this summer in real estate?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Well, we're seeing a lot more inquiries, we're seeing lots of people at open houses, which is great, right?  That starts the process.  And we're seeing people happy that it's spring.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right?  They go outside, there's flowers blooming.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you think the prices are going to come down?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Yes.  But it doesn't mean they're not going to take advantage of those prices coming down, right?  Buyers will buy if they get a bargain.  So they're looking for that bargain.  Interest rates are so good now that anybody looking to buy is saving, what, 0.3 percent from just a month ago.</p><p>J. LENZ:  And as sellers become more realistic, you know, we're going to see a lot more traction, a lot more buyers in the market.  As she said, you know, spring is just the best time of year for New Yorkers.  It really is a seasonal, somewhat of a seasonal market.  No one wants to go see stuff in the winter, it's cold, everything looks terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about the millionaire's tax?  Let's get into the taxes that are -- that are taking effect.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Not good -- not good.  Millionaire's tax is really another trifecta problem, right?  So, large supply of inventory, over-supply of inventory, lack of foreign buyers and now this tax, right?  And plus the original tax, it's not good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The cap on state and local tax deductions.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deduction on the mortgage interest (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>D. LENZ:  Which isn't even a cap, it's really a elimination, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Because most people pay more than $10,000, so it is an elimination of real estate tax reductions.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The number transactions in Manhattan in the first quarter I read was the lowest in 10 years.  So it is having -- people don't want to buy in high tax states for myriad reasons.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly, and we're also seeing the huge move down to places like Florida because it's not a -- you know, a tax state.</p><p>J. LENZ:  Right, and ultimately, this will all be priced into condos in Manhattan, right?  If you're going to make us pay higher taxes, we're not going to pay as much for an apartment.  That's what we're seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, just to be clear, James, in California high earners are taxed 9.3 percent, plus an additional one percent surcharge on income over a million dollars.  On the opposite coast, New York's upper cast taxed 8.82 percent on income over a million in 2018.  And that's not including an additional millionaire's tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Or the New York city tax.</p><p>D. LENZ:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait a minute, we don't get the California weather either.  So maybe there's not a good deal there.  (INAUDIBLE) OK, so not a lot of buyers, prices lately not that firm.  One, the people who are looking to buy, what are they looking for?  Is it different from previous times?</p><p>D. LENZ:  Well, they're looking for smaller, more efficient, newer homes and especially --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 4, 2019][Time: 06:00:00][Tran: 040401cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Carlos Ghosn Rearrested; FB Records Exposed; Amazon Moves Worldwide Operations Team From Seattle To Bellevue; China I.P.

And Happy Thursday, everybody, thanks for joining us.  Good morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Carlos Ghosn back behind bars this morning.  Last night, what an unbelievable night I had.  I was about to start an exclusive interview on the telephone with the former Nissan CEO when all of a sudden, 10 agents stormed into his apartment and arrested him.  Took him away in a car.  I'll tell you all about it, the full story coming up.</p><p>Startling new details this morning in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, preliminary results of the investigation blaming Boeing 737 Max flight control system for the fatal crash.  Tesla deliveries heading reverse, the automaker reporting a decline of more than 30 percent in the first quarter.  Plus, the Securities and Exchange Commission case over Elon Musk's tweets, that's headed to court today.  Meanwhile this, Conor McGregor may be coming out of retirement.  The cryptic tweet that's sending shockwaves through the MMA world this morning.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And good morning.  The markets this morning are showing some declines.  Take a look at Futures edging lower with investors focusing on the U.S.-China trade talks this morning, as authorities in Japan re-arrest former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn early this morning in Tokyo.  Ghosn is now facing new charges of financial misconduct.  He denies any wrongdoing.  I spoke with Ghosn this week.  He said in a statement last night, my arrest this morning is outrageous and arbitrary.  It is part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors.  I will not be broken.  I am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman; and republican strategist Erin Elmore.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see everybody.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what a night last night.  We scheduled an interview with Carlos Ghosn at 5:30 p.m. last night.  I came back to work, I'm sitting there, getting ready for the interview.  I'm texting with his lawyer, his lawyer says, OK, he's going to be calling in momentarily.  Now, it's 10 to 6:00, we're waiting for Carlos to call in to discuss the interview.  I had already spoken with Carlos Ghosn over the weekend on Saturday, and he discussed the charges, told me everything that you've heard here first for the last 100 days, that this was a coup, he's denying all of these charges and saying that he is innocent.</p><p>All of a sudden, I get this text from the lawyers, 10 agents just showed up, they are -- they took him into a room, they're in the room alone with Carole, his wife, Carole and Carlos Ghosn in the room with prosecutors, talking for a few minutes.  Then, we see them take Carlos in the car and drive away.  They took him to the prosecutor's office and they interrogated him.  He was there -- we were unclear if they were going to put him back in detention or if they were just going to question him.  In the meanwhile, agents went back to the house and they started interrogating his wife, Carole Ghosn.</p><p>Now, part of the reason here is because, as you remember, he put out that tweet a week ago, saying I'm going to -- it's time for me to tell the truth, to tell everyone what's going on, that he wanted to give a press conference, he was expecting to give a press conference on April 11th next week, they did not like the fact that he was going to discuss publicly, I believe, his phones obviously are tapped, the phone is lawyer -- a phone from his lawyer and I believe they are probably tapping Carole Ghosn's phone as well.  Because they probably knew that he was about to talk to the media, he was going to do this interview with me.  And so, they went right when we were going to do the interview, at 10 to 6:00 in the morning.</p><p>Then, they went back, they interrogated Carole Ghosn.  And they -- she wanted to go to the bathroom, they went in the bathroom with her.  She wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the bathroom, in the shower, while she was in the shower, taking a shower.  They want to break him.  The judicial system in japan is such that they want a confession on all of these charges, something that he is refusing to give.  This is an extraordinary situation, it is getting worse.  He is once again behind bars.  He could be there another -- he could be there 10 days and then they could add another 10 days to it, meaning he'll be there another 20 days before he can apply for bail to come out before a trial.  All Carlos Ghosn is asking for is a fair trial.  It doesn't look like he's going to get one.</p><p>ELMORE:  Would you know this, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>ELMORE:  That in Japan, there's a 99 percent conviction rate.  So, the odds are really stacked against him here.  He's also asking that the other defendants, his colleague, Greg Kelly and Nissan itself will be in a separate trial, so then he will get a more fair trial.  However, what I heard from Japanese legal experts is that once you've been released on bail once, you're not likely to be rearrested once, twice, or even three times which has happened to him here.  So, the odds are truly stacked against him.  It does not look good for him.  99 percent conviction rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wasn't going anywhere.  He was not a flight risk.  He was in an apartment that was approved by the Japanese government.  He wasn't violating any parole, but they went and they took him.  Now, this new charge that they're trying to make is that he sent money to a company in Oman, Jordan and he used that money, and then he used the money -- and then they paid him to buy a yacht, to spend money on personal items.  That cannot be proven.  I mean, money is fungible, there's no way to say that the money that Nissan paid to this dealer in Oman was the money that he used to buy his yacht.  It's just -- it's very hard case to make.  His team believes that one of the reasons that they went back to arrest him overnight is because their case is falling apart.</p><p>Now, Carlos Ghosn told me on the phone over the weekend, the reason that this all happened, this coup happened underneath him is because the company was not doing well.  The company was collapsing.  His underlings thought they would, number one, be fired; and number two, that he was going to merge the company with Renault.</p><p>He told me he wasn't planning on merging the company with Renault.  However, he was planning a lot more consolidation, and he was in fact, having to fire people.  He had to consolidate because the company, if you look at the stock chart, if you look at the losses, if you look at the decline in revenue, the company was not doing well.  I don't know how Nissan does any better.  I mean, I'm sure that there are going to be activists that want to boycott Nissan, boycott Japan.  I mean, for a foreigner operating in Japan, what does this look like to you, James?  This is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you certainly had a situation where the Japanese managers at the company did not want him in charge, did not want to be run by a European company.  So, I think that's one of the big questions about this case, along with obviously a lot of people as they got to know the Japanese legal system over the last several months, seeing how long someone can be detained without access to a lawyer, pretty shocking.  But also this question of why now?  Why -- he's been running the organization for years and then all of a sudden when they see this potential consolidation of power in Europe, not in Japan, the Japanese executives come up with these charges against him.  Very suspicious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're also coming up with reasons to question Carole Ghosn.  They took her passport, they took her phone, she no longer has the phone.  He no longer has a phone.  They said sources close to Carole said that they wanted her to voluntarily answer questions.  When I wanted to use the bathroom, the officer entered the bathroom with me and did a body check.  When I wanted to take a shower, a female prosecutor stayed in the shower with her while she showered.  They wanted to humiliate Carole Ghosn, they wanted to intimidate her, and they want to intimidate Carlos Ghosn into confessing.  This is what this is all about.  Let's break him so that he admits to all of this, then he can get out.  All he wants is a fair trial.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where is the -- where is the global outrage about this?  About any CEO, whether it's one in the United States or in any other nation that does business in Japan being outraged?  Their -- the backs of their heads should be blowing off in rage, quite frankly.  The fact that -- I mean, what does this say about the abuse of people, of non -- of the non-Japanese?  And I pointed out, this is a cultural problem, it's not just a problem with the judiciary system.  It's that Carlos Ghosn and his family are targets because they're gaijin, they're non-Japanese.  What -- how is it possible in a developed nation that you have a prosecutor that follows the wife of someone who is under arrest into a bathroom?  Does a body search of that individual and then stands in the bathroom when the wife showers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, this is almost beyond comprehension.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's barbaric, and that is what it is, barbaric.  And I -- and this is something else that I heard, insiders told me that now there's a fight or -- going on between the Prime Minister's office and the prosecutor's office.  Apparently, the prime minister's office has been saying why would we re-arrest him?  This is going to be a stain on Japan.  But the prosecutor's office is feeling like this is my -- you know, this is my situation, and I want Carlos Ghosn to admit this, and they went forward.  But there is a bit of, you know, back and forth between the Prime Minister's Office and the Prosecutor's Office.  They have different takes on how to proceed.</p><p>And I think it's because of what you just mentioned, the global reaction to this.  Where are the global investors, where are the global CEOs to say, this is wrong, stop this treatment of Carlos Ghosn, particularly since over the years he's been hailed as a superman for rescuing Nissan?  He was a comic book character.  They've written books about him and stories about him, about what a strong and leadership position he has taken on in this company.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And we'll see.  I mean, eventually, this will get tried.  There will be a public disclosure, a lot of which there hasn't been to this point.  So, we'll see if they can make a case.  But I think in the meantime, to kind of reassure people, especially people looking to do business in Japan, they might -- prosecutors might start by explaining what they're doing.  I think to someone looking at it from afar, you don't even understand the possible reason for this shower episode.  What -- I mean, what is the justification and what is the reason, what is the theory that requires this kind of intrusion into, again, a relative of the accused, not the accused?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm guessing -- I'm guessing, they're trying to put more pressure on him to cut a deal.  Again, then with 99 percent conviction rate, number one.  And number two, they're trying to make sure that his story doesn't get out to the world media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking phones away.  They're putting -- they're intimidating his wife.  They're trying to make sure that the rest of the world doesn't find out what is going in -- going on within the Japanese judicial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Which is why they started -- rumors were circulating that he was going to be rearrested yesterday before they actually showed up at the House because he was talking about giving a press conference on April 11th.  And I'm sure that because I was communicating with them through the wife's phone, they probably had her phone tapped because it's too coincidental that they show up right before we were about to go on air.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's always a why now, why was he rearrested then at that moment, that's the why now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll keep following this, obviously.  We want some answers from the prosecutor's office and we want to actually understand why a female prosecutor had to stay in the shower when Carole Ghosn was taking a shower and be in the bathroom when she was in the bathroom.  What is going on in Japan?  We're going to cover it here.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal has done incredible reporting on this this morning as well.  A preliminary report on the Ethiopian plane crash, meanwhile, is taking aim at Boeing.  Cheryl Casone with that story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Just getting that breaking news within the last couple of hours, Maria.  This report is critical of Boeing's instructions for the updated 737 Max 8 jets.  It found, and this again is an Ethiopian report, that the Ethiopian jet repeatedly nose-dived before it went down and that the flight crew have performed all procedures that were recommended by Boeing, but were still unable to control the plane which kept nose-diving over and over.  Now, investigators blamed an anti-stall feature on the 737.  That, of course, has been a focus of this global investigation.  The report from the Ethiopians recommends that the flight control system be reviewed by Boeing and that aviation authorities should verify this system before the aircraft is put back into operation.  No real effect on Boeing stock though right now.  It's basically flat in the premarket.</p><p>Now, let's talk about Facebook, they are under fire again.  A cyber security firm has discovered that hundreds of millions of Facebook records were exposed on Amazon's Cloud servers.  The firm says the information included account names, e-mail addresses, and comments, and that all of it can be downloaded by the public.  Now, Facebook says it worked with Amazon to remove the databases once it did learn about the issue.  But now, of course, it's becoming public, the stock as you can see, Facebook up about three-quarters of a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Amazon moving thousands of employees from Seattle to a city that's nearby.  They're planning to relocate the entire worldwide operations division to Bellevue, Washington by 2023.  An Amazon spokesperson says the company is looking forward to bringing more jobs to Bellevue.  And there, Maria, is Amazon in the premarket, slightly lower.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  Let's slip in a short break, then we're talking about China trade.  President Trump met with Chinese -- a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He today after talks proved productive yesterday.  We've got the details next.  Then, a possible retirement retraction, Conor McGregor's cryptic tweet and feud with a fellow MMA fighter may put him back in the octagon, much more ahead on that when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning.  Coming up, Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is with us this morning, along with New Jersey Congressman, House Agriculture Committee member, Jeff Van Drew.  \"The Coming Collapse of China\" author, Gordon Chang is here; and former McDonald's CEO and FAT Brands International Chairman Ed Renzi.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big show right here in the next 2-1/2 hours.</p><p>First though, we want to kick this off with U.S.-China trade talks, President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House today.  The Vice Premier met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade representative Robert Lighthizer yesterday.  President Trump is likely to announce a summit between Chinese President Xi later today, that's according to The Wall Street Journal.  Joining me right now is InterDigital President and CEO, Bill Merritt.  And Bill, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>WILLIAM MERRITT, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, INTERDIGITAL:  Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  You're doing a lot of business in China.</p><p>MERRITT:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that.</p><p>MERRITT:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has that been for you?  Has the trade issues gotten in the way?</p><p>MERRITT:  Actually, I would say the trade issues have been very helpful to us.  I mean, the focus of the Trump administration on protection of intellectual property, we're a company that has 20,000 patents, covering wireless technology, and we've been trying to license in China for years, and we've given them this very stark fact, we've got 95 percent of the non-Chinese manufacturers under license, paying us more or less (INAUDIBLE) billions of dollars.  We don't have a single Chinese manufacturer under license today.  So, that's the focus by the administration on enforcing I.P., creating benchmarks to show that they're complying with I.P. has been actually very good for us.  And we -- you know, we're cheering them on in what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you've seen firsthand then, the theft of I.P.  Tell us about that.  I mean, how significant is it?  What kind of a cost do you see as it impacts your company, and do you think you're really going to be able to see I.P. theft go away, or is that a cultural thing in China?</p><p>MERRITT:  I don't think it's long-term cultural.  It has been.  I think it can change with enforcement.  You know, in terms of the impact, if you think about what we do and others in our industry do, we hand over the technology to the industry, to build phones, and the return is we then get licensed under the patents that cover that technology.  The impact has been when -- with the Chinese companies not paying royalties to us, they have extra money now to invest in research that we don't have.  And the impact has been in 5G.  They have got tons of money to invest in 5G while research companies like us don't have that money.  And it's creating this imbalance in the research environment for 5G.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  So -- well, so as you look at a Huawei or a ZTE product, do you say, hey, that's looks a lot like our stuff in there?  Or, I mean, how are they doing it without licensing?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, it's an open standard in the sense.  We contribute our technology to the standard, anybody can get it, anybody can build a phone.  So, any phone that's built, we know has our technology in it.  How do they get away with not paying royalties?  They simply just refuse to pay.  They hold out.  You know, a company like ZTE, we've been in litigation with ZTE for almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So, they owe you, they just don't pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're still in litigation?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, in terms of -- we have this I.P. theft, that's one thing.  But in China, there are no regulations in terms of workplace, labor, minimum wage.  How can we even level this playing field at all?</p><p>MERRITT:  Yes, I think there's a lot of issues that go into leveling the playing field, right?  And there are some are within our ability, and others are not.  So, you know, things like intellectual property, certainly, there's ways to level that.  There's ways to level all these things, and I think President Trump tweeted a while back about 6G, and telling Americans, you have to compete with other people.  We're not going to just keep people out of the market.  We agree with that.  But compete on a level playing field, and I think he's doing a fantastic job at creating that level playing field as best we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of enforcement action do you think is possible to get the Chinese to keep their promise that they're not going to steal I.P.?  I mean, we're taking a look at Huawei a lot in terms of Huawei stealing trade secrets from Cisco, Motorola Solutions, you know, T-Mobile, et cetera.  So, what do you think it's going to take to get them to keep their promises that they won't steal?</p><p>MERRITT:  So, I think -- I think it's three things: first is a firm commitment from them; the second is the benchmarks, the benchmarks would be concrete activity, signing a certain number of license agreements are things that can be actually measured; and the third is some level of enforcement beyond that.  If those benchmarks are not met, I think that they will work to change what has been a difficult culture in time over time, but you have to work to change that culture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>MERRITT:  I appreciate all of your time.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Merritt there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning, the New York Post is reporting Uber spent $2 million to help push through congestion pricing.  Uber officials say that they're proud of their role in helping pass -- helping to pass the controversial plan to charge drivers a fee for entering Manhattan below 61st Street.  Roughly $1 million paid to some of the top city lobbyists, another 700,000 going to the Fix Our Transit coalition's ad campaign.</p><p>The Chicago Sun Times says Democratic socialists now control one-tenth of the Chicago City council.  Three Democratic socialists winning spots on the 50-seat council in Tuesday's elections.  They will join two others who won back in February.</p><p>And the L.A. Times this morning writes this, Disney shows off Fox titles to cinema owners as a new era takes shape.  Disney delivering a presentation at CinemaCon yesterday, kicking things off with a sizzle reel from several Fox films before showing off new footage from \"Aladdin\" and the \"Lion King.\"  Walt Disney Studio Chairman Alan Horn said that Disney would continue to support an exclusive theatrical release before making movies available at home.  Good stories there this morning.</p><p>But I want to get back to Bill Merritt that we were just talking about.  He made a really good point, as he was leaving, and that is, the Chinese discussions with the United States have taken a new form after the Mueller report was released and the fact that there was no collusion.  Because now the Chinese are saying to themselves, OK, we are looking long term, but now we might have to deal with this guy for eight years.  There's no collusion, he may very well win again, re-election.  So, it just tells you how the talks may very well have taken on a different tone given the U.S. an advantage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wanted to point out a story that's in the Wall Street Journal, too, that talks about -- looks like President Trump is going to announce the -- at least when that summit will take place on Thursday, that's the goal.  But that the United States is part of the enforcement mechanism, wants to keep these punitive tariffs in place.  We will leave the tariffs in place until you prove that you are abiding by this agreement, and that is the sticking point with the Chinese.  But I mean, tariffs on 200 -- you know, a quarter of a trillion dollars in imports in the United States, that's a very, very powerful enforcement mechanism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is poised to leave the tariffs in place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And so, that's -- that seems to be because China wants them kind of date certain for them lifting those tariffs.  And by the way, there are $110 billion worth of U.S. goods that have retaliatory tariffs slapped on them.  So, it's been a drag for the economy.  Certainly not a knockout punch, but a drag.  We'll see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, this whole Mueller report actually is a factor as well.  And the point that I was making was, can you imagine how irresponsible the media and the Democrats have been over the last two years by talking about things like treason, you know, this President committed all of these crimes for two years, it gave the Chinese this upper hand to think that they could actually have their way, that maybe this President is on his way out.  Now, that the Mueller report is out, and it's clear that there's no collusion, they're thinking, well, maybe we have to deal with him for eight years, we better get in line.  That's how irresponsible the last two years have been.  This President is trying to do international deals in North Korea, in China, and they've got the Democrats and the media driving this story, this narrative that never made sense.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So corrosive for people who would not accept the results of the 2016 election.  And we've talked about how investors generally never believed in collusion because you'd see headlines about this alleged conspiracy that put a Kremlin plant in the White House, and markets ignored it.  Essentially had this huge run-up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But that doesn't mean that foreign leaders, especially the nonmarket ones, didn't think maybe this guy is not going to be around, maybe there's something to collusion, and certainly to the extent, they believe it or even suspected it, it weakens his hand across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- and now, you have a whisper campaign that's just beginning, and I want to point out it would -- I'd be remised if I didn't.  The story in the New York Times that they posted yesterday, that people on Mueller's team are sending out signals that wound up on the front page of The New York Times, saying that Bill Barr understated the findings in the Mueller report.  I don't know what the motives are there.  If you read the story, there's really no there, there.  They won't say what it understated, there's no detail.  But again, this is the whisper campaign.  It might be an effort to push this -- the full Mueller report out, and make sure that Barr includes more information in it than he otherwise would.  But again, Robert Mueller is working with Bill Barr to decide what they can release to Congress and ultimately the public.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, first, they won't -- they won't adhere to the results of the 2016 election, now they won't adhere to the results of the special counsel who was godly in their -- in their minds just six months ago, and the attorney general.  You know, Jerry Nadler, the head of judiciary, is calling him a political appointee.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think the New York Times doesn't want to give up the dream, and you wish there was more of an understanding in the media generally that enormous destructive mistakes were made and they're ought to be some reassessment.  But I'm not seeing that at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The New York Times is clearly the aqueduct, carrying water for the people who hate the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And CNN as well.</p><p>ELMORE:  The legacy media and the Democrat Party are one in the same at this point.  You have to just realize.  And they're paying the price for this.  So, there's no collusion.  Now, they're still questioning the report, and next they're saying, we want tax returns from the President.  What's next?  And how is this going to play out?  Not well for the Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  We'll talk about that.  We've got to talk about 2020 because now, Congressman Tim Ryan is going to join the race as well.  We'll take a break, we'll talk about that.  Coming up, more accusations against Vice President Joe Biden after he responds to the initial allegations, what that means for a potential presidential bid.</p><p>More troubles, meanwhile, for Tesla, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in history, as Chief Elon Musk faces off with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  That's next, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 4th, your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are waiting on President Trump's China trade meeting today, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, Dow Futures down 17, S&amp;P down two, and the NASDAQ down seven.</p><p>Markets were a little changed yesterday, as well.  The Dow Industrials added 39 points on the session.  The S&amp;P was up 6, and the NASDAQ, top performer, up 46 points, that was two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, and we do see a mixed story, FT 100 down 41, that's one-half of one percent, CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15, that's a third of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany is up a fraction, six points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the indices were mixed and as you see, the best performer was China, Shanghai Composite up about one percent.</p><p>There is a tornado threat, severe weather in parts of the south, this morning.  We'll have the very latest on your forecast.  And then, McGregor, shocking the MNA world with a tweet that could land him back in the octagon, got those details coming up.</p><p>Plus, this, start your engines, Dolly Parton makes a statement on the NASCAR track this weekend.  We will tell you how.  And wrap it up, Mexican food chain celebrating National Burrito Day today, in a big way, offering plenty of discounts and promotions, we've got all those coming up.</p><p>But first, we want to kick this half hour off with Tesla troubles, the automaker reporting its biggest sales decline in its history.  CEO Elon Musk, meanwhile, is facing off with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, in court, over contempt charges, Dagen on the story, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deliveries, let's clarify that, new vehicle deliveries in the first quarter for Tesla, fell 31 percent from the previous 3 months.  The electric car maker clearly struggling to ship its model 3 compact car to now customers in Europe and China, for the first time.</p><p>This fell came in even below analyst expectations.  That was the biggest drop-off.  We should point out that the first quarter was Tesla's, and so it was 31 percent drop in deliveries.  Last quarter was Tesla's first sales period following the beginning of the phase-out of that important U.S. tax credit.</p><p>So, the tax credit is now $3,750 per car, down from $7,500 for buyers.  That's another concern.  So, Tesla reported two straight quarters of profits, of profitability, it's not likely, based on these numbers, to be profitable in the first quarter.  That was kind of a warning that we got several weeks ago from Elon Musk, anyway.</p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock is doing premarket, before I move on to, well, court, today, for Elon Musk.  It's down 8-1/2 percent in premarket trading, so this delivery shortfall was a surprise and a big one, based on how the stocks moving this morning.</p><p>Meantime, here, in New York, a Federal judge is going to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that's trying to hold CEO Elon Musk in contempt for violating the settlement deal with the SEC.</p><p>This was over these tweets.  The settlement was over these tweets that he sent, funding secured, back in August, and then he was tweeting about how many cars that the company would produce.  He had to amend that tweet earlier this year.  This was in mid-February.</p><p>Here's what's going to happen, probably nothing.  That if the judge sides with the SEC, Elon Musk could get another fine, maybe a big one, limits on his social media use.  He will not get ousted as the CEO of Tesla, mark my words.  You know, it's theoretical, a possibility, but not going to happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Question for you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>ELMORE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not done.  We -- this is this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, in a Manhattan courtroom.  It's not clear if Elon Musk is going to be there.  I would say, not likely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In a Manhattan courtroom.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's it.</p><p>ELMORE:  So, I was going to ask you, since he has this agreement with them, and this is a contempt hearing, I think it's likely that he will be found in contempt.  He did violate the settlement from last fall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He argues that he didn't.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He says that the settlement -- that the SEC says in place, that they are trying to enforce it in a way that it does not exist.</p><p>ELMORE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they did.  The -- it's -- he is supposed to have people, in the company, review the tweets before they go out.  The tweet was quickly amended and it wasn't off-base, based on things that had been communicated to investors.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm talking about the tweet in February, I think that this is a whole lot of nothing and the SEC doesn't like being called the short seller enrichment commission by Elon Musk.</p><p>So, I think that he has been poking the bear and the bear is clawing back, and I don't think anything significant happens out of this court hearing today, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He likes to poke the bear, the SEC, and he likes to poke the short sellers too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>ELMORE:  And we'd like -- we have to see how aggressive the SEC is going to get today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  What was that, funding secured twitter message that got him in trouble in the first place.  Looks like production not secured either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Hey, let's talk 2020, guys, because new developments here, Joe Biden, first, three more women reportedly accusing the former vice president of inappropriate behavior.  Biden broke his silence and he released a video.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Social norms have begun to change, they've shifted, and boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it.  I get it.  I hear what they're saying.  I understand it.  And I'll be much more mindful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Karl Rove is weighing in this morning in the Journal.  The Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush has a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled this, Don't Count Joe Biden Out.</p><p>Rove writes this, Mr. Biden's subsequent apologies and his promise Wednesday to be more mindful because social norms are changing are acknowledgements that he is struggling in today's Me Too culture.  This reinforces the sense that his first day as presidential candidate will be his best one.</p><p>ELMORE:  I don't know about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As the touchy, feely person on the panel --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll weigh in on this, and I'll get into trouble, but I think it's always been the responsibility of a woman, if a man gets in your space, or another woman gets in your space, then you need to look at him and say, hey bud, you need to have an elbow here, and say, you know what, I'm not that kind of person, don't like, pinch my elbow, don't -- because I'm not that kind of person and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll have what I would do, get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just get off of me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have said that to people.  There was a creepy guy who was on air, once, here, it's not anybody working in management or who was on staff, but he started giving me a shoulder rub in the hair room, and I turned around, I was like, you need to put it in reverse, buddy, and back this truck up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back off.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't put your hands on me.  And you know what?  If somebody like Joe Biden, like, put his arm around me, I would just think that that was just a sign of affection --</p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in a very, excuse me, nonsexual way, Southerners are exactly like this, men and women, and I always hate it, because I encountered this in New York, where you would refer to somebody -- when I first started working here as, thanks, hon.</p><p>And then, the person would go around you, and go to management, and complain about you, rather than just looking you in the eye and saying, please, don't address me that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm not your honey.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, that's why -- I</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what I hear you saying is, he shouldn't get bullied out of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just because he smells somebody's hair or kisses them, maybe he shouldn't get bullied by this, even though norms have changed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I find it very --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's no tolerance --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- suspect that these women come out now, and then complain about it publicly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when he's about to declare his run for the Democratic nomination.  People who clearly, one of them, at least, a Bernie Sanders supporter.  That they say it publicly, but never had -- never looked at him and said, you know, and said, I'm not comfortable with this.</p><p>ELMORE:  But speaking of publicly, all of this conduct occurred in public.  No one is alleging anything that wasn't on camera or in front of a big crowd.  No one said things happened behind closed doors or in a bar or in a restaurant or in a hotel or on text.  This was all conduct that occurred in the public eye.  So, what could have really happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, will we be talking about Biden, as a 2020 contender, in six months?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will he be able to get over this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The -- really quickly, the one thing that he does -- that Karl Rove writes about, which you mentioned, that he needs to stop apologizing.  Remember, Cynthia Nixon called him out for referring to Vice President Mike Pence as being decent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We actually talked about that on the show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he needs to stop apologizing for that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, his only premise as a candidate is that he's going to chart a more moderate course.  So, if he begins his candidacy, if he does become a candidate, and he spends all of this time trying to persuade people that he's just as woke, just as hard left as the other candidates, then there's no point in running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can tell you for sure that Congressman Tim Ryan, from Ohio, will enter the race. He is going to run for the presidency.  So, this question about Joe Biden is opening up a whole new avenue for Tim Ryan.  He could be a force because he's from Ohio, he's a working man's guy, he's not radical left, crazy idea Green New Deal, 70 percent tax rates.  What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this does look like a bet that Biden's not running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But, you know, he's not --Ryan is not that moderate, so that's going to be a question, but definitely, striking a more moderate tone at least.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  They can't beat you on ideas.  They'll try and shut down based on your personality, and I think Joe Biden's feeling that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, moderate relative to --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a short break, then we've got to get to Cheryl.  Markets are lower this morning after finishing higher yesterday.  We'll tell you what's moving and we'll tell you the big news of the morning when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new CEO at PG&amp;E.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE:  Maria, good morning again.  PG&amp;E tapping Bill Johnson, he is the current head of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  He will now lead the troubled California utility.  PG&amp;E also announcing a new board as it looks for a way out of bankruptcy.  They face billions of dollars in liabilities for their role in starting deadly wildfires in California.</p><p>Well, severe weather in the south to tell you about, after hitting Texas, a series of thunderstorms is ready to slam other southern states, including Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi.  Large hail and damaging winds expected across the region today.  A few tornadoes could develop.  Forecasters say the system is going to continue to move east tomorrow.</p><p>And finally, Maria, it is National Burrito Day.  Mexican food chains from Chipotle, (INAUDIBLE) are offering deals to celebrate.  And you can be, if you want, a human burrito.  Yep.  Tortilla blankets for babies and adults now viral.  Now, if a burrito isn't your thing, Maria, and I have no idea if it's not, possibly more important, May 5th is National Enchilada Day.  Let's get excited about that.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I really want to wrap up like a burrito.</p><p>CASONE:  Don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, markets this morning seem to be searching for direction, of course we are waiting on news out of the China-U.S. trade talks.  They are close.  I understand that we got a market that is very close to where the indices closed yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon out with this annual letter.  In it he says this: \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition trade but they are manageable.\"  He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.  Joining us right now the Kadina Group President, Gary B. Smith.  Gary, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see markets today?  Are you still bullish?</p><p>SMITH:  I am getting less bullish, I'm afraid.  You know, the times that we've been together in New York, I think I was very bullish.  Hopefully at the right time.  Now, as we start to get toward those old highs and the fact that volatility has dropped, back to where it was in last October, when there was really nothing on the horizon to bother it, bothers me.  Because it tells me there might be something out there.  We don't know what it is, some black swan event.  Maybe it's in the investigation into Trump's tax returns, maybe it's the whole China thing going south.  I get worried as we approach those old highs, especially as we've gone almost straight up since Christmas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anywhere to hide?  Real quick.  You're expecting a decline in stocks then?</p><p>SMITH:  I think we go to the old highs.  That's another 700 points.  I guess if I was an investor, I'd probably start to take a little off the table, maybe go to 50 percent cash as we get there and kind of wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks for weighing in briefly.  We appreciate it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Spurs' head coach ejected, just 63 seconds into the game.  Jared Max on sports, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Like they say, that escalated quickly.  Gregg Popovich, the first NBA coach in seven years to get kicked out of the game in the opening two minutes, barely lasted one minute -- 63 seconds into the Spurs' eventual loss at Denver.  Pop was gone after being issued a second technical foul.  Maybe something with coach from Texas last night, because the Houston Astros' manager and head coach were both kicked out pitch apart in a loss to the Rangers.</p><p>If you like trying to hit a golf ball through a moving windmill, you are going to want to check out Steph Curry's new venture.  Yes, the Golden State Warrior star is going to become the executive producer and resident golf pro for a 10-episode series on ABC called \"Holy Moly.\"  (INAUDIBLE) but are going together the best mini golf players to compete on epic course.  Each episode has 12 contestants and $25,000 to the winner for each show.</p><p>What was it?  Eight days ago?  We told you that that ultimate fighting champ star, Conor McGregor, said he was retiring and now we suspected that it probably wouldn't the case.  Well, last night, Conor McGregor pretty said he's unretiring, on the same day where had exchanged nasty tweets with fight rival, Khabib Nurmagomedov.  Conor wrote on Twitter: \"I want to move forward with my fans of all faiths and backgrounds.  All faiths challenge us to be our best selves.  It's one world and one for all.  And now, we see you in the Octagon.\"  So, he's going back.</p><p>And the queen of country is about to be the queen of the racetrack.  Check this out!  Dolly Parton is sponsoring her own race car driver.  Tyler Reddick is going to speed off in the pink Chevy Camaro at a race this weekend.  The Xfinity Series on Saturday in Dolly's home state of Tennessee in Bristol.  Dolly Parton on a race, Maria.  How cool is that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Do you know anything about that, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Xfinity race, which is on Saturday, and it's at Bristol motor speedway's thunder dome.  It's the greatest racetrack in racing, so everything should watch it and everybody loves Dolly, everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I like that pink car.  Thank you, Jared.  Jared's sports reports are on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.  Still ahead, the Patagonia power suit no more; why you'll no longer see the iconic clothing brand at some top tech and finance companies?  Right here, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2208138201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-1SM1-JBHT-D3H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank  you so much.  Happy Tuesday to you.  And good morning, everyone.  Thanks  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it is Tuesday, November 20th, your top stories right now just before  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets in selloff mode once again this morning.  Take a look at  futures, pointing to another day of loses on Wall Street extending  yesterday's loses, down 164 points right now on the Dow Futures, two-thirds  of one percent.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">S&amp;P 500 down three quarters of percent, 19 points lower, and the NASDAQ  currently down 77 points, better than one percent lower on the NASDAQ this  morning.</p><p>After yesterday's dropping, take a look at the sharp declines yesterday,  and this wasn't even the worse.  The markets actually closed off of the  lows of the day.  </p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both falling roughly one and a half percent on the  session.  </p><p>The real weakness was in technology.  The NASDAQ was better than three  percent on the session.  That was 322 points lower yesterday.</p><p>Check out the declines in the biggest technology stocks yesterday, really  the leadership on the downside yesterday, Facebook was down almost six  percent, Netflix down four percent -- I'm sorry, almost six percent as  well.</p><p>Those were the worst performers on the day.  </p><p>Apple, Amazon, as well as Alphabet, all very low, sharply lower yesterday.</p><p>Global markets following the U.S. lower this morning.  The FT-100 is down  two-thirds of a percent, 42 points lower right now on the Financial Times.  </p><p>The CAC Quarante in Paris is down about one percent, 45 points lower, and  the Dax Index in Germany down 104 points lower, that's about one percent  lower right now.</p><p>Overnight in Asia, declines across the board.  Taking a cue from Wall  Street, China was down better than two percent on the Shanghai Composite  and the Hong Kong Hang Seng.</p><p>Well, the future of Renault-Nissan Alliance hangs in the balance.  Leaders  from France to Japan are looking to take action following the shocking  arrest of Carlos Ghosn.  </p><p>Retail earnings in focus this morning, major names including Target,  Lowe's, Kohl's, Best Buy, all set to report their earnings this morning.  </p><p>We will have those results and tell you what they say about the health of  the consumer and the economy right now.</p><p>Plus crypto carnage, Bitcoin prices plunging below $5,000.  What's behind  this decline coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Forbes Media Chairman and Former Republican Presidential Candidate, Steve  Forbes, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN AND FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE:  Good morning.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And now -- thank God you two  are here to make sense on these markets this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another major selloff yesterday as these concerns continue,  Lindsey.  What do you think's behind it?</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I mean I think it's really this growth concern that has been  plaguing the market in the last several weeks, and obviously trade, that  plays into the growth concern.  </p><p>With Apple, you know, leading the tech sector lower, the concern really is  with iPhone demand, but the consumers seem strong and I think that you're  going to hear that what the retailers are going to report today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think, Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  I think it boils down to that one word, \"trade,\" having a real  trade war with China, tariffs perhaps coming in January, but the  uncertainty's starting to hurt business investment.  </p><p>You don't know what the rules are, you can start to hold back.  And that  uncertainty's starting to creep around the U.S. economy.  So the sooner -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why CapEx spending is really -- we're looking at that,  to see whether or not business managers are saying, \"You know what, I don't  know where this trade deal is going, let me just stop putting money to  work, which -- </p><p>FORBES:  That's right.  And that's why the meeting in Argentina between Xi  and Trump is going to be critical.  </p><p>Are they going to set the right tone so people feel, \"Okay, they'll work  this out in the next few months,\" or is the temperature going to get lower,  colder?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the problem, too, with the business investment side, and  exactly what you're talking about, corporations are backing off on their  investing and probably they're hiring as we go into year.  </p><p>Because we don't have the wind at our backs of tax reform or fiscal  stimulus.  So, that's wearing off.  So, we really need to come on to a  conclusion.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And here's another earnings in the retail sector.  </p><p>Lowe's just hitting the tape, earnings beating expectations with $1.04  share versus an estimate of $0.98 a share.</p><p>Pretty much when you look at all these retail earnings, they've been better  than expected.  </p><p>Revenue at 17.42 billion, versus an estimate at 17.36 billion, over and  over we're seeing this trend, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But L Brands got hammered yesterday.  I think it was down two  percent on the day, but that's an antiquated business model.  </p><p>I think that they need to rethink the kind of underwear that they're  selling to women.  </p><p>That was my opinion yesterday.  </p><p>Nordstrom though was a disappointment last week, so it's been hit or miss  depending on the retail earnings and of course later today we do get  Target, which is a -- kind of a little bit broader indicator of what's  going on.  </p><p>But if Lowe's does -- if Lowe's is doing well, it'll be interesting to see  how the stock reacts because home builders have really been hammered in  recent months, even this year because of the higher interest rate.  </p><p>You saw sentiment come in yesterday as a disappointment for the home  builders.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We had on the CEO of the International Shopping Centers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was on about two weeks ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said it's going to be a knock-out fourth quarter.  </p><p>And anybody I've spoken with continues to say it's going to be a knockout  fourth quarter in terms of consumer earnings.  </p><p>I know that it's been hit and miss on some of these numbers, but for the  most part, the consumer has been pretty song.  </p><p>So, I think -- I think you're right, I think it's the trade, uncertainty,  and that is keeping business spending at bay.</p><p>FORBES:  You wave the magic wand and all these trade disputes disappear,  the Dow would go up 5,000 points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  I agree with you a hundred percent on that.  </p><p>And if you look at some of the retailers actually in the last week -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  -- I know, you know, the tech wreck has a -- has a huge saying and  some of those stocks are in bear market territory from their highs.  </p><p>But the retailers -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BELL:  -- Macy down 11 percent in the last week, that's worse than some of  those FAANG Stocks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huh.  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  Right?  Walmart's down seven percent.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  Okay.  </p><p>BELL:  -- they're reporting good numbers, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet they're not -- people are not reacting.</p><p>BELL:  But the investors are worried.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  The fourth quarter last year was so good -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BELL:  -- that even though it supposed to be good this year, they're  worried that they're not going to be -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll add, people who work for retail industry organizations  tend to be a little more optimistic than investors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they're not the owners of the stocks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, people will sell first and ask questions later.</p><p>FORBES:  And then listen -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it is about growth.  It is about growth.  </p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) caution out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  You see that automobile sales aren't quite as robust as people  would like.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FORBES:  So, people are just wanting to know, what's the future?  </p><p>We know with the markets, it's not today, it's what they think might happen  in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's an -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I will say this, the President of the Dallas Federal  Reserve Bank joining me this weekend on Wall Street this upcoming Friday  and he continues to believe that we may see three plus percent this year in  growth.  </p><p>But it's going to go all the way down to 1.9 percent at the end of '19  going into 2020.  So, that'll be on this weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And even though earnings are expected to grow next year, this is  something Lindsey has pointed out.  </p><p>We were expecting going into the third-quarter earnings season of double- digit growth in 2019, and now it's single-digit growth, right?  </p><p>It's -- where is it now?  Eight and a half percent roughly?  </p><p>BELL:  7.9.  It's coming back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it keeps coming down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  We got a lot to talk about this morning.  </p><p>And then of course there's the latest news on Carlos Ghosn, which we're  going to get to as well.  </p><p>Coming up this morning, joining the conversation, Texas Congressman and  House Veterans' Affair Committee member, Jodey Arrington is here.  </p><p>Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer will join us along with Fox  News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane is here.  </p><p>Former Toys\"R\"Us and HBC CEO, he's also the former Target Vice Chairman and  Storch Advisors CEO, Jerry Storch is with us.  He's going to give us a good  window into what's going on.  </p><p>And then media and tech, Activate Founder and Partner Michael Wolf here to  talk about the carnage that we've been seeing in that sector.  </p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we have a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with our top story and that is tech tumbling.</p><p>Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, all take a dive yesterday and  have been taking a dive in the last month coming in the heels of what has  been a terrible month for the technology industry.  </p><p>Both Facebook and Apple down better than 10 percent over the last month.</p><p>Joining us right now is SkyBridge Capital Senior Portfolio Manager, Troy  Gayeski.  </p><p>And Troy, good to see you this morning.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this carnage we've been seeing.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, look, I think in regards to what you discussed on trade,  there's one other factor to remember, and that -- and the big picture here,  for quite some time, capital markets outperform corporate fundamentals  which, in turn, outperform the real economy.  </p><p>And a lot of that had to do with the Fed's hyper loose monetary policy, not  only here but with ECB.  </p><p>And so what you've seen this year is as the fed has tightened and obviously  they're winding down their bond portfolio, we've seen a significant  multiple compression in equity markets, which is very healthy for the  longer term.  </p><p>But in the shorter term, we think volatility will continue to be elevated  and you've seen a lot of deleveraging, particularly in the hedge fund  industry the last six weeks.  </p><p>Which have added to this very ugly tape, not only in tech but across the  board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- </p><p>FORBES:  Do you -- do you -- do you think the fed's going to go ahead with  multiple rate increases next year or are they going to take a pause?</p><p>GAYESKI:  So, look, they're going to go -- </p><p>FORBES:  Or are they going to indicate a pause in the next couple of weeks?</p><p>GAYESKI:  The -- they're -- let's start with the probability of outcome.</p><p>So, December, they're more than likely going to hike. </p><p>FORBES:  Right.</p><p>GAYESKI:  And then (INAUDIBLE) Powell started to walk back, the potential  for more aggressive hikes, so we would say next year is more like one to  two hikes this stage, given the softness we've seen not only in the U.S.  but overseas.  </p><p>That onto itself, though, might not be enough to get the bull market really  supercharged again unless you get a resolution for trade. </p><p>The broader point here is that the years of massive outperformance from  equities versus corporate fundamentals and real economy are over.  </p><p>And if you look at next year, if you're talking high-single-digit earnings  growth, that's probably the high-end of return expectations unless the  dollar really tanks, which could cause a little bit of upside from there.</p><p>FORBES:  So are we going to see real slide on corporate buybacks of stock?   Which was a huge mainstay the last (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  So, in terms of buybacks, the pace has to come down, right?   From where this will be the peak year in terms of buybacks.  </p><p>Even though a quite a large amount of capital's gone into CapEx as you  discussed before.  That's trending down.</p><p>So that will be removed, one of the -- reduced the buying power of one of  the most steady buyers throughout this whole bull market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Journal is reporting that Apple suppliers are facing  turmoil.  Let's take a look at Apple for a second because it's really been  taking a massive decline.  </p><p>The results of the technology giant's decision to cut production orders for  all three of the iPhone models unveiled in September.  Is this a sign of  bigger problems?  </p><p>I got to give Dan Niles credit again.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because Dan Niles joined us back in October and he was very,  you know, cautious on Apple.  Before the company reported, he was right, he  talked about a supply issue and that is an issue.  </p><p>But now you see the suppliers having their own issues.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  The whole supply chain is getting hammered.  So, you know,  if you look through it, right?  You had investors that were extrapolating  several quarters of extremely strong numbers.  </p><p>It -- basically not into infinity, but at least over the next several  quarters.  </p><p>Now what you've seen is you've had a global slowdown.  Remember, not only  in the U.S., but China slowed significantly.  Europe's way off their growth  rates of last year.  </p><p>A lot of the topline numbers have not been hit and, you know, that's flowed  through the stocks.  </p><p>And the other point we made, you know, last time around the show was how  crowded they were, right?  </p><p>And not only Apple, but Netflix, et cetera, so, you know, the downside  potential in heavily-crowded stocks that miss their fundamentals is rather  enormous compared to uncrowded options.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Facebook at a critical turning point.  </p><p>The Journal is reporting this morning that CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to  take a more aggressive approach given the recent scandals hitting the  company.</p><p>What do you think about that?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, look, so -- from a hedge fund standpoint, most hedge funds  (INAUDIBLE) that position back in Q2.  </p><p>The view was that we had peak social media back in Q1 and Q2</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So have you been short, these stocks?</p><p>GAYESKI:  We're not short, we've been out.</p><p>So, we had a little bit of exposure earlier in the year we've been out.  </p><p>You know, right now, it's not quite a high -- a track of risk-reward to get  overly short.  You want to be defensive, you want to be in cash-flow  oriented positions.  </p><p>And you want to bide your time to start the Point Capital once we get a  floor on the markets.</p><p>Because right now, we're about to retest lows and there's a chance we go  through there.  </p><p>If we do, sit back, wait for things to stabilize, and into early next year,  it'd probably be a better buying point.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, but if you look at Apple getting to your cash-flow point -- </p><p>GAYESKI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BELL:  -- and quality, people want quality, especially in the tech space.  </p><p>Looking at Apple trading it just over 13 times now, they have a ton of cash  on the balance sheet, they're buying back a ton of their share, to Steve's  point.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  They're going to buy back about a quarter of their shares over the  next -- over here for the next three years.  Wouldn't this be a time to get  into Apple?</p><p>GAYESKI:  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not unless you face tariff risk.  And see, Apple has been immune  from the tariffs so far and kind of been immune from the trade fight that  the U.S. is having with China.  </p><p>However, if we move ahead and there isn't a resolution, Apple has nowhere  else essentially at this point to make that iPhone -- </p><p>GAYESKI:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but China.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so maybe that's part of the -- part of the reason people are  selling.</p><p>FORBES:  But a real fundamental problem with Apple is there's not the wow  factor anymore.  They got these nice little improvements on the 11, 12, and  the 21, whatever else they're bringing out.  </p><p>But what's the big leap forward, so to speak?</p><p>GAYESKI:  We got some -- it's unclear what the next transformational  technology will be.</p><p>To your point, every change they made is incremental, that's the point.   You've brought up, remember, there's short, medium, and long-term, so as a  long-term investor, this is a good entry point.  </p><p>However -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  -- you have to look at the short-term, and the technical still  look pretty ugly, it's still heavily owned, and Apple, even though they've  played their cards better than most of the FAANG Stocks in terms of the  political environment in Washington -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  -- you know, if the trade war takes a turn for the worse, there  could be supply chain disruption as you've been highlighting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  One thing I'll point out about the whole Mark Zuckerberg  fight.  Again, the guy was busy learning Mandarin and reading a book every  two weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And essentially, it seems like now that he's angry about the  response to all of the pressure from the outside of the company and the  missteps within it, it seems it begs the question of where have you been  the last couple of years?  Number one.  </p><p>And number two, you have the founders of Instagram who are really the  reason for the success of that part of Facebook's business, they're gone.  </p><p>And, again, will Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg fouled out up to is  another question.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, look, I think -- to be fair, you know -- </p><p>FORBES:  What's your point of view?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, no, no.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's a -- again -- </p><p>GAYESKI:  It's a great point. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said this yesterday, a friend of mine said over the weekend  when I was -- did you read -- I asked, \"Did you read the New York Times  article about Facebook?\"</p><p>And he said, yes, have a drink and join the party.  This is what  everybody's known about the company, the way it's run -- </p><p>GAYESKI:  For a long time, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and the way it operates for literally -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- oh, I don't know, over a decade.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, forever.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they've been allowing this stuff to go by and not do  anything.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean even when it comes to regulation, which is a point  you've pointed out over and over again that they should have been policing  themselves.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we were laughing about Sheryl Sandberg writing that book.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, telling women how to live their -- live their lives -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's like how about doing your job? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  No, one thing to say is to be fair, creating a successful  tech company is very different than managing the political environment -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HIGGINS:  -- and regulatory environment in Washington.  Right?  So that's a  -- that's a tricky (INAUDIBLE) to negotiate as Steve can highlight, I'm  sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick before you.  Lowe's, Kohl's, Best Buy, Target, all  reporting earnings.  What's your sense of the consumer?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Oh, so the consumer is in fantastic shape.  I mean even if you  look at withholding data, which one -- is one of the most real-time  indicators you have, there's a chance we hit the similar withholding this  year as we did last year, which is remarkable.  </p><p>Because even though the economy is doing better, remember, as the cycle  matures, it's harder and harder to create more and more jobs with low  unemployment.  </p><p>So, we think consumers are in tremendous shape.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I think, too.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean it -- but we'll see.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Recession risk a low, but that doesn't mean markets are destined  to go up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, Troy.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Great to see you, too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Troy Gayeski there.  </p><p>Coming up, a leadership crisis at Renault after Nissan Chairman Carlos  Ghosn is arrested on a slew of alleged financial violations next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fallout after the arrest of Nissan Chairman,  Carlos Ghosn, Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  After that shock arrest  yesterday for Carlos Ghosn, the French Finance Minister and the Wall Street  Journal is reporting this.  </p><p>\"We'll ask Renault, the board there, to install interim leadership at the  company as they continue to investigate what is going on.\"  The Finance  Minister did say that Carlos Ghosn has some nice qualities.  </p><p>But obviously this is a -- this is a problem for Renault, for Nissan, and  for Mitsubishi, that is a trio, a car conglomerate, that Carlos Ghosn  forged.  </p><p>And when he forged, it was all about scale.  Now those companies produce  one in nine cars worldwide.  They make that many cars, really competing  with the big player, which is Volkswagen.  </p><p>So when he first created that that was about scale, but now -- because the  question is, well, in the absence of leadership, what happens to that pact?  </p><p>Well, now that pact has to compete with Silicon Valley, so the times have  changed.  </p><p>Of course, as you know, the shock arrest yesterday for Carlos Ghosn.  He  was arrested and jailed, accused of underreporting his pay for using  company assets for private use.  </p><p>We saw the stocks tank yesterday, Nissan stock was down six percent,  Renault stock was down sharply.  </p><p>Many of these stocks trading to the downside in Asia today as well.  </p><p>So now they're looking for new leadership.  In the meantime, at Renault --  and I do know that the Nissan Board will meet on Thursday.  So -- </p><p>FORBES:  How much was this conglomeration just dependent on one person and  how much of it was truly structural?  Can it -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's the question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is such an important question because -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he was the Chairman of Nissan -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he was running Renault -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and he was also overseeing Mitsubishi.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, those three companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you have that much power, that's what people worry about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was the Chairman, so it's Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi  Alliance.  He was Chairman of the alliance and Chairman of each individual  -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- automaker on top of it.  And then as Maria just said, the CEO  of Renault.  </p><p>And it looks like -- people on the outside, Steve, questioned, whether this  was a tenable situation that it was solely dependent on him.  </p><p>And right now it looks like how are they going to keep -- prevent it  unraveling.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And that's where competing with tech, competing with Silicon  Valley comes in, because, yes, he did architect, he was the architect of  that alliance, but the times have changed.  </p><p>And maybe somebody else can come in, or maybe the focus is different now  for these companies because they're not just competing with Volkswagen,  they're competing with, you know, Tesla and that sort of idea of electric  and artificial intelligence.</p><p>FORBES:  But how well would those companies survive if they weren't allied  together?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good question.  </p><p>FORBES:  It's a very, very competitive world.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We'd ask why the stocks are down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean how ironic that Carlos Ghosn as one of the first people  to bring an electric car to the table, okay?  </p><p>And they didn't gain traction when he first came out with the electric car.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Relief for Nissan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And then all of these -- they never took -- it really  did not gain traction, but he was really one of the first to come out and  say, \"This is where the market is going.\"  It's a shame.  It's a shame.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Nissan was almost bankrupt when he moved in and bought a  stake.  </p><p>FORBES:  But he saved it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, he saved Nissan.  So he is -- </p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) bring Frenchman into a Japanese company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it -- he -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He was known for cost-cutting.  That was his trademark.  </p><p>FORBES:  Extraordinary (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  That was his trademark, a brilliant mind, but really scared a  lot of these companies with his aggressive cost cutting, too.  That's how  he got them, one of the ways he got them back on track.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's extraordinary that he was arrested in Japan when Japan  looked at -- lauded him I mean like a comic book figure was created around  him.  </p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean he was big in pop culture, but it's really, what a  comedown.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Astonishing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a comedown.  Lauren, thank you.  We'll keep watching that.  </p><p>Coming up, caravan crisis, the federal court says no to enforcing President  Trump's asylum ban as the fight over border wall funding continues in  congress, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are indicating another decline at the  start of trading this morning.  </p><p>Take a look at markets, down 162 points on the Dow.  Down 20 points on the  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ down 83 points right now.  </p><p>Looks like another tough open this morning.  Meanwhile a police officer  attacked by a knife-wielding man in Belgium.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Good  morning.  </p><p>The suspect described only as male was shot by responders there.  It  happened outside the city's main police station around 5:30 a.m. local  time. </p><p>The officer is in the hospital with none life-threatening injuries.  Police  say they don't have a official motive, they're not as of now calling it  terrorism.  </p><p>But a Belgian newspaper did report the man shouted, \"Allahu Akbar.\"</p><p>Belgium has been under tight security since the 2016 terror attacks that  killed 32 people.  </p><p>Well, back here at home, three people are dead after a gunman opened fire  at a Chicago hospital.  The suspect, Juan Lopez, shooting and killing his  ex-girlfriend in the parking lot before running inside and shooting two  others.  </p><p>Responding officer, Samuel Jimenez, was one of the victims killed.  He was  with the Chicago Police Department for just 18 months.  </p><p>He leaves behind a wife and three children.  Police say the gunman was also  killed but it was unclear who pulled that trigger.  </p><p>And then the value of Bitcoin continues to plummet.  It's now hovering  below $4,500 this morning.  It hasn't been this low since October of 2017.  </p><p>The selloff comes up in speculation that increased regulations are going to  prompt (INAUDIBLE) to liquidate their holdings.  </p><p>Bitcoin a notoriously volatile cryptocurrency at its peak, remember, that  was last December.  </p><p>Bitcoin hit nearly 20,000, which means the price has fallen, Maria.  </p><p>About 75 percent, a lot of folks are not looking for risk right now and  Bitcoin's kind of a good</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 20th.   Your top stories right now, it's 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures indicating another lower opening for the broader averages this  morning.  </p><p>Wall Street's going to see another downturn at the start of trading, down  172 points right now on the Dow Industrials, that's two-thirds of one  percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is down 21 that is three quarters of a percent, and  the NASDAQ with a 90-point decline, is down one and a third percent.   Extending yesterday's sharp fall, the major indices finished in the red  yesterday, and this was off of the lows of the day, at the close.</p><p>The Dow Industrials down 395 points yesterday had been down better than 500  at its worst, down 1-1/2 percent at the close.  The S&amp;P was down one and  two-thirds percent, but the NASDAQ was the really worst performer, hardest  hit, down better than three percent at the close, 220 points lower on the  NASDAQ.</p><p>Google parent, Alphabet, joining Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, now, in bear  market territory, after yesterday's fall, as you can see the sharp declines  there, Apple, stopping short just $0.21 cents away, pretty much they're all  in the bear market territory at this point.</p><p>In European trading this morning, take a look at the indices and we are  seeing selling across the board, the FT-100 down two-thirds of a percent,  the CAC Quarante in Paris is down better than one percent, as is the DAX  Index in Germany.</p><p>Asia, overnight, take a look, lower across the board, worst performer,  Shanghai and Hang Seng, in China and Hong Kong, down better than two  percent.  Meanwhile, retailers are reporting earnings this morning, lows  came out earlier, with better-than-expected numbers, top of the hour, as  you can see, low shares, down two percent, yesterday.</p><p>We are moments away from Target, reporting its earnings as well.  We are  expecting earnings per share at Target at $1.12 a share, revenue of $17.8  billion, but take a look at the stock premarket, down better than four  percent right now, as the numbers are -- </p><p>It's double miss, the numbers are hitting the tape right now and they are  missing earnings and revenue with this quarter, and that's why the stock is  down four percent, Target, hitting the tape, weaker than expected, on both  the earnings line and the revenue line at $17.8 billion in revenue.  As you  can see, the earnings at $1.09 versus an estimate of $1.12 a share on  Target.</p><p>Meanwhile, a record on the gridiron, the Rams and the Chiefs taken to the  field with a record-setting game, we'll have that for you.  The teams are  taking a moment to salute first responders who are fighting the wild fires  in California.  We will have all of the details, coming up, in sports.</p><p>Plus, Alexa, get me my tree, Amazon delivers live Christmas trees this  holiday season.  Amazon shares taking a hit this morning, in the premarket,  extending yesterday's selloff.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, border battle, a federal judge blocking  President Trump's asylum rules, which look to prevent immigrants from  seeking asylum if they cross the southern border, illegally, it comes on  top of a fight over immigration on Capitol Hill, funding the border wall.</p><p>President Trump is keeping the door open to a partial government shutdown,  joining me right now is FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack  Keane, General, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.) FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to see  you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this judge's ruling.</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think it's unfortunate.  I think what the President and his  homeland security team was trying to put in place, is not a process that  deny asylum, quite the contrary, to put in place a process so that it would  be orderly, that the people would be protected.</p><p>You do it at the port of entry, just as where our cars come in, and  therefore, you don't have to pay somebody $5,000 to take a mother and two  kids across the river at night, that's the nonsense that's been going on,  and it's unfortunate, I think, that we have this interpretation.</p><p>I think there's going to be another look at it in a few weeks, and maybe  the President will get a better ruling out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this court is basically saying that anyone, seeking asylum,  can come to the border and just get in, then?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, he's saying that the law of our land, states, and he knows  better than I, because he looked at it, that if you're seeking asylum, in  the United States, you can do that from any place in the United States, a  place of your choosing, and you can ask for that asylum.  That's the rights  that we have given to people by the laws of our land.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's the catch and release, though, right?  I mean,  then, if you're caught crossing the border illegally, you get caught, but  then, you get court date and we just have to release you, so you may or may  not show up for that court date.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, the problem is, people are caught all over the extent  of the border and we do not have, in place, a system and a process to be  able to take care of them, so what we are trying to do is organize that  process, get the tents there, get the entire system there, so we can speed  that process up and do it properly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>KEANE:  -- as opposed to being forced, because we can't sustain and support  it, to release somebody and tell them, hey, take a bus some place and head  on out into America, doesn't make any sense what we are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  It's really incredible what's going on.  Meanwhile,  there's the defense budget, new concerns here, military services reportedly  looking for places to cut, as demanded by the White House, going into these  two appropriation's bills.</p><p>They've got to get done by the deadline, December 7th.  You took part in a  bipartisan report, providing for the common defense, which warns about the  risks of cutting budgets right now.  What are you expecting this to look  like, in the next week or so, ahead of the December 7th deadline?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I hope there's not significant cuts, I understand the  pressure on deficit and certainly on the debt, but the reality is, what we  try to say in our report, is that because of the 9/11 war, 17 years.</p><p>And because also of sequestration, there has been serious erosion of U.S.  military capability, so much to a point, Maria, that we don't guarantee  anymore that, we could win a war against China and Russia, we have  commanders out there who doubt that seriously and we've spoken to them.</p><p>So, this is -- this is a clarion call, we're trying to raise awareness that  we really have a serious issue here and resources are a part of it.  Now, I  would hope the Congress would step up to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you expect the easy places to cut, if anywhere?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I've always said this and I had the opportunity to say this  to the President, when he talked to me about the Secretary of Defense  position, I said, you know, the Department of Defense is not a business,  but it has business-like functions, use real-estate holdings, product  development, et cetera, and we don't run them like business-like functions.</p><p>We don't do cost analysis and try to take costs out like people do in a  private sector.  We don't do exhaust to financial reviews to find every  dime that's not being spent properly.  If we got that system in place and  really put some teeth into it, I think we can find money in that Department  of Defense, I'm convinced of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Well, we'll wait to see, because this is obviously going  to be front and center in the next two weeks.  We are also waiting a White  House report on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>President Trump says over the weekend, that we could get the report today,  General, that follows the back and forth on the reports that said, first,  the CIA found Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman did order the murder.</p><p>MBS is reportedly going to the G20 next week.  This is going to be some G20  meeting next week, with all of these hot-bun issues.  What's your take on  what this report shows, what if it does show that MBS did order this hit  against Jamal Khashoggi, how does the U.S. respond?</p><p>KEANE:  I don't think they have conclusive evidence to that, at least,  that's what I'm reading, given the leaking that's taking place with  intelligence services.  I think this, though, this relationship has been  damaged and the relationship is in our vital national interest.  Can we  repair it?  Yes.</p><p>But, I believe we have significant leverage now, Maria, because of what  took place.  I mean, at a minimum, you've got to come to this thought, that  the Saudi culture and the Saudi environment tolerated the killing of a  dissident, who was speaking out against the regime, by officials that were  very high up in the system, not necessarily MBS.</p><p>That is at a minimum what took place and that is unacceptable, and we have  got to change this relationship.  We are at the intersection right now and  national interest and values, and we've always had this kind of tension.   We have an opportunity to move the Saudis closer to us, on values and  insist on it, and insist on full disclosure, and insist on accountability.</p><p>We will not going to put up with this nonsense if we are going to go  forward together and have a relationship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what are the vehicles to do that, General, because there  were already some sanctions put on individuals, correct?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so what is in the tool box for this administration to tell  Saudi, we're not going to tolerate this kind of behavior, but at the same  time, yes, we do want you as a partner, we recognize the threat of Iran?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think we reset the table in terms of what are the  conditions for the relationship to go forward, and we laid that out for  them, and then we assess how that relationship is progressing and we tell  them that's what we are going to do.</p><p>And this is absolutely pretty outrageous, what has taken place here, and  the administration has every right to stand up and call it out for what it  is and also insist on behavior change by the Saudis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will -- we will watch that then.  Let me ask you  about Venezuela, the White House reportedly considering designating  Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism, adding to the list, what effect  would that have on Venezuela, and do you think this is appropriate?</p><p>KEANE:  You know, I think so, I mean, they have the -- they have the facts  that I don't have, in terms of what is actually taking place inside the  country and the terrorist organizations that are gathering there.  You  know, the Iranians and the Hezbollah are there, and they are supporting  those kinds of activities.</p><p>So, if we've got the evidence to that, then let's get on with doing it, and  isolate Venezuela for the pariah that has becoming by virtue of who is  running that country.  And I still think the issues in Venezuela are  largely those belonging to the countries that are in the region.</p><p>I don't think the United States has to take a lead role here, but the  United States shouldn't sit on its hands either, and this is a step in the  right direction.  But we've got to work with our allies in the region who  are very close to Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, at this point, the White House says it is likely  putting Venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and I don't  think anybody is surprised by that, General.</p><p>KEANE:  No, no one's going to be surprised and I do think it helps the  regional leaders in the other countries, as well as we go forward.  I mean,  it's a real mess there, as all know, we've been talking about it now, you  know, for a couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  It's tragic what's happening to the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Thanksgiving to you.</p><p>KEANE:  Same to you and your family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane joining us there.  I want to give you an  earnings alert, because Target is out, but the stock is down sharply.  Now,  this is -- this is actually a mixed report.</p><p>Earlier, I said it was a double miss, it is not, because the revenue was  actually a bit better than expectation, accounting for other revenue on top  of sales, revenue actually was fractionally better than estimates, as you  can see, at 17.82 billion versus an estimate of 17.8 billion, so it's  pretty much in line, but obviously, the market is seeing it as a weaker  than expected report overall.</p><p>The earnings were weaker than expected, and that's an issue at $1.09 a  share versus an estimate of $1.12, so all in all, this market is seeing  this report as weaker than expected across the board, with a nine percent  selloff, after same-store sales also missed estimates.</p><p>So, even though revenue was in line or a little better, you can argue it  either way, earnings and same store sales really driving the stock this  morning, down nine percent.</p><p>Take a break, when we come back, Ivanka Trump is firing back, lawyers for  the White House official, slamming misinformation this morning, over report  she used a private E-mail for government business, we've got all the  details next, and then, fully grown Christmas trees, courtesy of Amazon,  the shopping giant's new delivery venture, right here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An actress files a restraining order against  Michael Avenatti.  Cheryl Casone with that story now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  The filing coming just days after Avenatti  was detained on domestic violence charges.  Not clear if the actress was  the same woman who accused Avenatti of domestic violence, but Avenatti is  an outspoken critic of President Trump and the attorney for adult film  star, Stormy Daniels.</p><p>Well, Ivanka Trump's lawyer firing back ahead of a report saying she used  her personal e-mail for official White House business.  The Washington Post  alleging Ivanka Trump has had hundreds of e-mails about government matter  last year, possibly violating federal rules.  But Ivanka's attorney  slamming that report saying, \"misinformation is being paddled in the press  and drawing a distinction with Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal.\"  Trump's  attorney says that she did not create a private server in her house or  office and there was never a classified information transmitted.  The  Washington Post reports that Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, also  had a private e-mail account on the domain, ijkfamily.com.  </p><p>Well, holiday season, really in full swing now at the White House.  Today,  President Trump and the first lady will welcome peas and carrots.  Two  lucky turkeys, they're going to take part in the traditional Thanksgiving  pardoning ceremony.  Of course, peas and carrots spent the night in the  presidential suit at a luxury D.C. hotel.  President Trump is going to  pardon the turkeys before they head off to live of the rest of their lives  at a sanctuary in Virginia, Dagen.  Yesterday -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Virginia Tech. It's at Virginia Tech.</p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's where the sanctuary is.</p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  This is yesterday when they welcomed the White  House Christmas tree.  It's the Fraser fir from North Carolina.  The tree  is going to be displayed in the blue room of the White House when it's all  fixed up.  Later today, President Trump is going to head to Mar-a-Lago to  spend Thanksgiving with the family.  </p><p>Finally, this, you can now get an Amazon Christmas delivered right to your  door pretty quickly.  Real full-size Christmas trees are now available.   Amazon says the trees come from farms in North Carolina and Michigan, and  they range in price and sizes, maybe $50.00-$120.  Prime customers can get  theirs delivered for free in three to seven days.  Taking a look at shares  of Amazon, lower in the premarket 1-1/2 percent.  So, you can either take  the family out and cut the tree down and go to the tree store or you can  just get it deliver today your door, it's your choice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, what are you going to do?  </p><p>CASONE:  Delivery, are you kidding me? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon is making it easy again, Lindsey.  </p><p>BELL:  In New York City, you got to have it delivered, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but other places too.  I mean, it's just -- it's  convenient.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes, easy.  </p><p>FORBES:  In rustic New Jersey, we still buy our set locally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, by the way, I adopted a bunch of turkeys for --</p><p>BELL:  You did?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't, I gave money to a farm sanctuary because, you  know, I don't eat, well, animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But anyway, you can give money to basically take care of a flock  of turkeys for the next year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that you did that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where the need (INAUDIBLE) where the money will go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When come back, a game full of touchdowns;  the Rams topple the Chiefs in one of the highest-scoring games in NFL  history.  More in sports right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a record game for Monday night football last night,  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  What a night in Los  Angeles, Maria, like a three-hour plus Hollywood production, nonstop action  and turned out to be the third highest scoring game in NFL history.  Before  the 9-1, Rams hosted the 9-1 Chiefs, first responders from recent  California tragedies along with victims honored on the field.  Players game  worn jerseys to be auctioned for charities.  Also, they got to like the  cauldron at the L.A. coliseum and then, the fireworks began on the field.   Fourth quarter, 37-30 L.A., this touchdown by the Kansas City Chiefs gives  K.C. a 44-40 lead -- one of the defensive touchdowns.  That was the first  of four lead changes in the final quarter.  </p><p>Rams come right back, Jared Goff with one of his four touchdown passes, 47- 44 L.A., still almost 10 minutes left and Chris Conley catches a 10-yarder.   Kansas City here sets the record for the most points in a Monday night game  between the teams, who would score last?  The L.A. Rams.  Gerald Everett,  40-yarder with under two minutes left, Rams win 54-51.  105 points -- third  most in an NFL game, eight away from the record.  First time two teams  score 50 in the same game, of the six-lead changes, four in the fourth  quarter, what a night in L.A.  </p><p>Baseball, Chief Wahoo, logo on Cleveland Indians uniforms and signage since  the late 1940s, gone.  The team reveals these alternative uniforms for next  season, no sight of Chief Wahoo anywhere, he had already been removed from  the team's traditional jerseys and also other signage.  </p><p>You heard the one about the Canadian curling team that got ejected from a  tournament this weekend because they were \"extremely drunk.\"  Gold  medalist, Ryan Fry, among the four men team, who was ejected from the Red  Deer Curling Classic in Alberta.  And Fry then went on Twitter and  apologized.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>FORBES:  Fry got fried.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You got to keep the bones warm, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were extremely drunk.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes, something like that.  Also, they caused some damage in the  locker room or whatnot.  Somebody mention to me this morning, our  colleague, that the only crime was them drinking Coronas in Canada.  It  should be, I guess a (INAUDIBLE) -- or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a relatively low-alcohol beer too, so you would have to  consume a lot of Coronas. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like they did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe it was more than the Corona.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think so.  I can't see it, it was only Corona beers that  got them so drink.  </p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) -- you never think of that.  By the way, New York  Yankees, Paxton.  </p><p>MAX:  Bigger picture, Yankees get the 6-4 Canadian-born pitcher, the first  Canadian to throw a no-hitter.  James Paxton comes over to New York, a good  lefty pitcher.  But Steve, I got to tell you, that football game last night  or early this morning, I guess, all those points like an explosion at a car  crash.  It was just one after another like we saw in last Super Bowl.  And  exciting game, I want to see some defense, because of all we're going to do  is go to the buffet, if all I'm going to do is and eat desert all night,  some of the sweetness gets lost.  </p><p>FORBES:  But don't you think this is going to help get attendance back  again?  </p><p>MAX:  You know who this helps, I think this helps Bill Belichick.  I bet  the Patriots coach last night saw all the weaknesses that the Chiefs have.   And when you look the AFC championship game in January, maybe Kansas City  and New England, I think Belichick profits from this game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Record night and it's not good enough for Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  No, it was amazing.  It was amazing.  But you know, I like some more  drama. </p><p>STEVE:  And the Indians, they got rid of the logo.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes, Wahoo is gone.</p><p>STEVE:  They're getting rid of the team, too, aren't they?</p><p>MAX:  I'm sorry?  </p><p>STEVE:  Aren't they getting rid of the team, too, aren't they getting a lot  of their key players?  </p><p>MAX:  Oh, yes, yes -- I thought you meant like in the movie.  Remember that  movie, \"Major League\"?  They're getting rid of the whole team.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God bless Bob Uecker.

The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both falling roughly 1.5  percent on the session.  </p><p>But the real weakness was technology.  The Nasdaq sliding 3 percent on the  session, down 219 points on the Nasdaq yesterday at the close.</p><p>Check out the declines in the biggest technology names -- Facebook,  Netflix, the worst performers on the day yesterday.  And as you can see,  Netflix was down 5.5 percent, Facebook down 5.75 percent.  The others down  between 3 and 4 percent overall.</p><p>Global markets following the U.S. lower this morning.  European indices are  now mixed.  The FT 100 just turned positive.  It's up now 7 points in  London.  But the CAC 40 is down 31 points.  That's two-thirds of 1 percent  and the DAX index in Germany down 73 points.  That's also down two-thirds  of 1 percent.</p><p>Overnight in Asia, declines across the board.  Worst performer was the  Shanghai composite in China, down better than 2 percent.</p><p>Retail earnings in focus this morning.  We are waiting on more as we speak.   Target reported mixed results last hour.  The stock is down sharply on  disappointing same store sales, also a miss in terms of earnings.  Target  shares down six and a third percent right now.</p><p>We are waiting on Best Buy and Kohl's.  We will bring you those numbers and  the analysis as soon as they hit the tape.  We've already heard from, as  you know, Target and Lowe's.</p><p>Thanksgiving countdown -- the wild winds could put the iconic Macy's parade  at risk though.  We have the forecast that could ground the balloons with  really heavy gusts of wind.</p><p>Then the turkey challenge that goes viral, parents are freaking out when  their kids ask how long does it take to microwave a 25-pound turkey.   Really?  Now Butterball is offering the answer.  We've got all that coming  up ahead of Thanksgiving.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman  and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, and CFRA  investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Very nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially on this holiday shortened week.  </p><p>BELL:  Can you even fit a turkey in a microwave is my question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  </p><p>FORBES:  It shows civilization can't be that bad.  We're talking about --  asking questions like that, having good fun.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's going to keep you laughing for the next two hours.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got the giggles.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hate when I get the giggles.</p><p>We've got a lot coming up because it's another rough day at the office at  the opening of trading this morning.  Joining the conversation coming up --  Texas congressman and House Veterans Affairs committee member Jodey  Arrington is with us this morning.  Former White House press secretary Sean  Spicer joining us, along with the former CEO of Toys R Us and HBC, now the  former Target vice chairman as well and Storch Advisers CEO Jerry Storch is  here.  Lots to talk about with Jerry.</p><p>Activate founder and partner Michael Wolf is here to go through all the  innovations happening in technology and get his take on the selloff.   \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host Stuart Varney weighs in as well as always.  Don't  miss a moment of it.</p><p>And we kick it off with this top story this half an hour.  A tech wreck on  Wall Street -- most of the big names in technology in bear market territory  right now.  Facebook down in the premarket this morning again, 5.75  percent.  The company hammered by bad news lately.  It is down another 1.25  percent right now extending that 5 percent decline for the week.  \"New York  Times\" detailing an article, how CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly ignored  warning signs that the site was being used to influence the election.   Reports also out on how Zuckerberg has his company on high alert and ready  for war after the negative press hit.</p><p>Here now is LJH Investment Advisors managing director, media and  entertainment analyst Larry Haverty joining us this morning.  Larry -- it's  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your thoughts on Facebook.  What's your reaction?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think there's the business and the stock and the business  needs a fair amount of repair -- Maria.  It's very, very clear that the  trust factor, which is absolutely critical in a business like this, has  been wounded.  That's the bad news.</p><p>The good news is that I think it's fixable.  And I think here in Facebook,  basically you have a situation where you have dual class stock so that Mark  is really the key mover and shaker here.  It's unclear whether there's a  lot of external influence on Mark's decisions.</p><p>I think at the end of the day he's going to do the right thing.  And I  think from the stock point of view, the way he's going to do the right  thing is to in fact add a lot of people and spend a lot of money. </p><p>And I think when he announced that he was going to do this about six months  ago at an earnings call, I think the stock became very, very difficult to  own because no matter what you think, tech investors don't like margin  compression.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  So we've had a lot of -- a lot of price correction here.  If you  take yourself and put yourself on a desert island, this stock is now no  more expensive than Coca-Cola or Procter &amp; Gamble.  And in my opinion it's  a lot better business. It's more global than even Coca-Cola and it has  basically zero cost of goods sold because the users make up the content.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  You don't get a product when you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we don't know what's coming, right, Larry?  I mean we don't  know what's coming in terms of regulation, in terms of new fees, in terms  of the pressure that this company might face -- Steve.  How do you he see  it?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, the pressures on regulation will be very real.  But Larry --  you mentioned hiring people, doing the right thing.  Can you get a little  bit specific about what Facebook should do?  People feel -- a lot of people  feel it's a tired product now.  And so what does he do to jazz it up again?   Make it an attractive stock?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think there's a couple of things and they're all going to be  painful.  I would like to see someone externally come in in a supervisory  position of considerable import -- more or less like what Google did with  Eric Schmidt.  I don't know who they would get.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you don't want to see Zuckerberg at the helm then.  You  don't want to see Zuckerberg stay as CEO?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think Zuckerberg needs a senior counselor.  He's going to stay  at the helm -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  You buy the stock, that's the way it's -- that's the way it's  going to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's got voting control.  So nobody's going to tell him to  leave -- right?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  No.  No, he's going to stay there.  But that doesn't mean that he  shouldn't have somebody blowing in his ear like Eric did with Sergei and  Larry to the great benefit of the shareholders.  That's the first thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's one thing that you mentioned yesterday -- Dagen.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  One other thing I'll point out is only about a couple of  months ago that the co-founders of Instagram -- Instagram being the growth  engine at Facebook, very critical.  The co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike  Krieger -- they left because Facebook was trying to remove the autonomy  that they had in running Instagram because again, maybe they want to foul  up Instagram the way that they have the rest of the social media platform.</p><p>But Larry -- I don't know if investors have fully factored in what this  means for Instagram in terms of those two founders and leaders leaving in  September.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And they're getting rid of these bad accounts.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes.  That can't be -- it can't be a positive.  But all of these  things, you have two things.  You have the business and then have you the  price of the stock.  And the price of the stock is down at extreme low  levels.</p><p>Now, the other thing that Zuckerberg and the board need to do, Zuckerberg  in particular, they need a massive share repurchase.  This stock has 27 --  has I guess $40 billion, I don't know exactly what the number is, but  billions and billions of dollars of net cash.  There's no financial  leverage in the stock at all.</p><p>The numbers are compelling for the stock to be bought by the company.  And  they've never been an aggressive share re-purchaser.  They need to do that.</p><p>So I think they need somebody from outside to come in a la Eric Schmidt.  I  think they need a massive share repurchase.</p><p>And then the last thing that I think they need to do, a lot of the  employees who are really critical here have lost a lot of money, Maria,  because this stock is a large part of compensation for those employees.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And one way or another, they've got to be made whole and that's  going to cost the shareholders a lot of money, whether they like it or not.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way -- the company said in the first quarter  earnings report that cash and equivalents rose to $44 billion.  That was  for the first quarter report, just to -- because you said you didn't know  the number.  </p><p>What were you saying?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One other thing that's hard to quantify is Larry, you talk about  making those existing employees whole but the ability to hang on to the  talent if they're not happy working there, based on the management at the  company, if they're not happy and actually luring other talented people  from other technology companies, if there's one industry where the jobs are  more plentiful than any other, it is in technology.  And there are a lot of  unhappy people within the walls of Facebook.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey Larry -- Lindsey Bell here.  I just want to ask about the top  line.  You know, they've got margin pressure.  You're saying they should  buy back shares.  Obviously the morale is a problem, regulation is coming  down the pike.  What are you expecting to see with the top line?</p><p>Ad sales is a huge component of that.  And they are one of the largest  advertisers out there.  Are they going to -- like is Amazon going to steal  revenue from them?  Is it going to be Google?  What's going to happen?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, you still have the very, very compelling fact that digital  advertising is gaining monstrous amounts of share from conventional  advertising.  And that Facebook and Google have a 75 percent share of  digital advertising.</p><p>Now clearly, Amazon is going to get some of those ad dollars and it's a  marvelous platform for advertising.  But I think Facebook and Google are  still going to be net share gainers and you're looking at Facebook as a  global proposition.</p><p>And in a large number of the countries, I don't think the users  particularly care about this and the advertisers I think they may care  about it but they're going to inevitably follow the users. </p><p>So my guess is, look, my guess is three years from now the cash flow growth  in this company is going to be in the neighborhood of 12 percent to 15  percent.  If that's the case, I think the stock's going to be a lot higher  because financially it's going to look like Coca-Cola or Procter &amp; Gamble.   It's not going to look like -- </p><p>FORBES:  Larry -- a quick question.  Quick question.</p><p>What are the odds of privacy regulation coming here that we have seen in  Europe and what would that do to their model?  Isn't that the real cloud  overhanging -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the issue.  Exactly, yes.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think they can live with the privacy regulation.  We're going  to see what it's done in Europe.  But I think that's a lot less problematic  than the fact that the margins I think are going to be really hurt by  having to make the employees whole and making the platform trustworthy.  </p><p>That said, a lot of the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't see a new regulatory backdrop as having to change  the business model in any way?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, I think there's going to be margin pressure, Maria, but  you're dealing with a company that has margins just almost confiscatory.   You know, well over 30 percent.  This is not the supermarket business.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to buy this stock?  it's down 25 percent year-to- date.  It sounds like you're looking mostly at valuation and the quality of  this company and you're saying look, the stock is now attractive where it's  trading.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes, there's only one caveat -- Maria.  I would like somebody to  buy it first.  I think -- I don't know what the price of -- the right price  of Facebook should be.  The market's got to determine that.</p><p>This is a stock that I think is best bought by investors and I like to  consider myself an investor, on the way up, rather than trying to be a hero  on the way down.  Because there's no such thing really in a stock as an  intellectual bottom.</p><p>I think there's only an emotional bottom and this thing is in the emotional  category right now.  And it's very hard to make, you know, tremendous sense  out of numbers when emotions are this high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  But this is the kind of behavior -- this is the kind of behavior,  Maria, that six months from now if we're talking, we're going to say oh, my  gosh, this was a tremendous opportunity.  But I'd just like to be a little  more cautious and let someone jump in the water before I do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are we talking about, a $375 billion market cap right  here?  I mean who would buy it?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, no.  I mean, I'm not talking about a corporate event.   There's not going to be a corporate event.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said you would like to see somebody buy it.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think it's -- no, I think, no I think it's investors.  I'm  talking about, you know, other investors.  I mean it would be nice if  somebody from Blackrock got in here and said, you know, I think we can live  with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  And I mean you know, you've heard Larry Fink is at the high end  of the ethics category.  If he thinks it's good enough for his firm,  probably it's good enough for me.  But I'd just like to see the stock start  to go up.  I think the emotion here is just too much to get in the way of  at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And you know, the other thing, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lost $120 billion in market value just as the stock slid last  week, that's incredible.  </p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Larry.  We've got to go.</p><p>HAVERTY:  You're going to start seeing margin calls.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Thank you for joining us --  Larry.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights as always form you.  We appreciate it.  Larry  Haverty joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, retail in focus today -- Target, Lowe's, Kohl's, Barnes &amp; Noble  all out.  We have the very latest numbers, giving you a sense of where the  consumer is going into the holidays.</p><p>Plus this, grounded -- wind gusts may keep the Macy's Thanksgiving Day  balloons from flying this year.  We've got it all coming up after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Get ready for record cold and winds and this could affect this year's  Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Oh, yes -- Maria.  </p><p>Forecasters say that those brave enough to watch Macy's Thanksgiving Day  Parade outside should bundle up for the coldest temperatures in 20 years.   And brace for powerful winds that can ground those giant balloons.</p><p>It's expected to plunge into the low 20s here in Manhattan but it will  likely feel more like the teens.  It's the coldest projected Thanksgiving  temperatures we've seen since 1996.  Parade officials say all balloons will  be grounded if winds exceed 23 miles per hour.</p><p>But the cold will not be keeping Americans grounded this Thanksgiving.   Triple A predicting travel for the holiday is going to be the busiest since  2005.  They're estimating 54.3 million Americans will journey 50 miles or  more from home, most of them by car.  That's up nearly 5 percent from last  year.  Triple A says higher wages, more disposable income and rising  household wealth are the reasons why.</p><p>And if Thanksgiving traffic doesn't give you enough of a headache, there's  a new turkey prank going viral ahead of the holidays.  It's driving parents  crazy.  The turkey challenge says text your mom and ask her how long it  takes to microwave a 25-pound turkey and then you have to post the results.   This is the kid.</p><p>One Twitter user said after she asked her mom called her an idiot three  times.  One mom responded wrap it in foil, put it in the microwave, then go  buy a precooked one so you can feed the fire department.</p><p>CASONE:  Butterball responded saying that microwaving a turkey is actually  possible, to Lindsey's question earlier, but you might want to find a  smaller bird.  If millennials, by the way, need turkey cooking advise  without getting shamed by mom, call the official turkey talk line, 1-800- butterball -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good idea.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Call 1-800-butterball.</p><p>CASONE:  You can do it though, if it's small enough.  That's what I thought  was interesting, you know.  </p><p>BELL:  They get hundreds and thousands of calls at that line for  Thanksgiving.  Impressive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, caravan crisis -- a federal court says no to President Trump's  asylum ban as Congress battles over funding for the border wall ahead of an  important deadline coming up.</p><p>Then fast tracking a deal, Chinese officials are approving Walt Disney  Company's multi-billion dollar takeover of 21th Century Fox's entertainment  asset, the parent company of Fox Business.  We've got the latest there,  next up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Checking markets this morning.  We are near the lows of the morning with  the decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 185 points, three- quarters of a percent.  The S&amp;P is down 22 points.  And the Nasdaq down 80  points right now, better than 1 percent.  We're looking at a weak open  extending yesterday's losses this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile retail earnings in focus, we've been bringing you a number of the  retailers reporting earnings this morning.  Big names like Lowe's, Target,  Kohl's, Best Buy, all reporting their quarterly earnings this morning.  And  as you can see in the premarket they are all lower, despite many of them  reporting better than expected numbers.</p><p>We're watching a school (ph) of major retailers including Barnes &amp; Noble,  TJX Companies and Ross set to report in the next hour.  And they, too, are  down about 2 percent on average this morning in the premarket.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former CEO of Toys R Us as well as the CEO of  HBC, former target vice chairman and Storch Advisers CEO, Jerry Storch.   Jerry -- it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>JERRY STORCH, CEO, STORCH ADVISERS:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>Ok.  We've got all this weakness and uncertainty around the consumer and  retail earnings.  How do you characterize the consumer right now?  </p><p>STORCH:  The consumer is not weak.  And there's no uncertainty about this.   This is the strongest consumer that we've seen in over a decade.  Surely  the sales being reported by retailers are dream sales.  Their sales like  the good old days when it used to be impossible not to have a 4 percent  comp, 5 percent comp.  That's not the problem.</p><p>So the problems that we're seeing with these retailers is either something  has to do with all retailers, that is a lack of confidence in the future,  you know, where things are going, whether it's with trade or the economy or  whatever.  Or some of the retailers are seeing their margins crushed as  they're buying the Internet sales to competing with Amazon and the profit  formula is under massive pressure.  And we did see that with Target's  report this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's it.  It's really a margin issue and they're trying to  compete and do digital as well as Amazon.  Not necessarily the strength of  the consumer.  </p><p>STORCH:  Yes.  I've been -- I started target.com, by the way.  I still own  Target stock from being vice chairman.  And, you know, we had to compete  against Amazon.  And what's funny is that we did everything exactly the  same as Amazon, we got punished because we wouldn't make any money just  like Amazon doesn't make any money -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STORCH:  -- in a lot of the Internet fulfillment (ph).  So bricks and  mortar retailers at the beginning weren't willing to make the massive  investments to compete with Amazon, they let Amazon grow.  </p><p>FORBES:  So who are the ones you think are doing it right and who is  stumbling? </p><p>STORCH:  Well, there's a lot of people doing it very well.  I think Walmart  is clearly the big competitor to Amazon in the future.  And it's going to  be those two dragons going after each other for dominance on the U.S.  retail stage, at a minimum, if not -- if not -- if not globally eventually.</p><p>So they're clearly doing it right.</p><p>I think Costco is fantastic.  Costco's value proposition is so superb.   People come for the savings.  All income levels -- they actually have  higher income shopper than any of these other guys, you know.</p><p>And people love Costco, great deals.  And you can't beat it because you buy  in bulk.  They're doing big time (ph).</p><p>The off-price, I expect to see great numbers at least on the sales line of  the off-price guys today TJ Maxx, Burlington, (INAUDIBLE), you know they  call Burlington now (INAUDIBLE) stores but you know, Ross -- these are  going to have great numbers.  So people who offer their customer value are  doing tremendously well.  </p><p>BELL: How do you feel about inventory levels though?  Because we saw -- you  know, you look at Nordstrom, you look at Dillard's, Target even today --  inventory is up.  But part of that is because retailers are ordering things  ahead of the tariffs going into place.  Maybe that's a concern for margins.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STORCH:  I'm not worried about the inventory levels.  Sales are so strong,  they're going to sell through that inventory.  It's really not a long-term  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not what happened with Apple.  Apple inventory was up 89  percent.  </p><p>STORCH:  Now we're out of retail and into tech stocks.  Totally different  story.  I'm not trying to judge -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that's going to be one of the biggest retail products  that people are going to buy for the holiday?  </p><p>STORCH:  Well, you know, it's a question of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  An Apple item?</p><p>STORCH:  -- right.  That's whether or not people are buying phones.  If  you're a -- versus other consumer products or buying Apple phones versus  other types of phones.  If you're a Target or Walmart you have you know, a  whole assortment of products.</p><p>I remember at Target, we used to use prerecorded music as a big traffic  driver.  Then we realized in the 90s that wasn't going away because we  could digitize it.  It's going to the Internet.</p><p>So we said what are we going to do, my gosh, we're going to lose here.  So  you sell something else.  So you think big stores -- big department stores  mass purchase and can sell other products.  Apple basically is dependent on  the phones.  And as that goes, so they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>STORCH:  That doesn't mean the consumer's not strong.  The consumer is  spending their money elsewhere.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not worried about the inventories in retail, generally  speaking then.  </p><p>STORCH:  No, I'm really not.  I mean individual companies, of course  because their product may be out of fashion or may not hit the mark.  It's  not like people are doing things poorly.  This is not a question of that.</p><p>FORBES:  So tariffs -- looking at the future, say we go 25 percent in  January instead of 10 percent, what's that going to do to the margins and  to prices that consumers face next year?  </p><p>STORCH:  You know, I believe that's very unclear.  It depends a little bit  on what alternatives are available in terms of alternative sources of  supply and also depends on what categories you're operating in.</p><p>You know, many, many -- right now a lot of retailers depend very heavily --  depend very heavily on China to source their products.  There's absolutely  no doubt about that.  And they're showing little desire to move the bulk of  that away.  But there are alternatives, you know, India, other Southeast  Asian countries, North Africa, et cetera for apparel, so there are options.   But you can't move them overnight.</p><p>So the real question is, if you're a retailer, can I move quickly enough,  can I be better than my competitor which is really all that matters and  whether I am or am not, when the prices go up, can I pass along to  consumers.</p><p>And I think for the retailer, this may not be a big loss at the end of the  day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The question is also do you start moving your -- changing your  supply chain and moving your manufacturing and your sourcing based on the  actions of essentially one man in the White House and the administration  because, again, it's not a job for life.</p><p>So do you make that decision if you know an election's coming up in less  than two years.  And I'm not making predictions.  I'm just saying that  that's part of the equation.  </p><p>STORCH:  You know, for quite some time retailers have been developing and  branded product manufacturers alternative countries to go to.  I mentioned  some of them just now.  You know, particularly for apparel, other than  China. Not because of tariffs, but because of the sense that eventually what would  happen is what always happens which is China would no longer be the lowest  cost producer.  And so it would migrate to the next country.</p><p>There's some opportunity to do that regardless.  But China is just so darn  big that right now I think most people are kind of hoping it doesn't  happen.  Or that there will be a solution other than having to move all  their production.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Black Friday is this Friday.  It's only Tuesday but  obviously there's a big holiday coming up.  We've got people lining up  already so that they're in place when the stores open on Black Friday.</p><p>What kind of a Black Friday are you looking for?</p><p>STORCH:  I think it's going to be tremendous.  Every year Black Friday has  grown.  And every year people say Black Friday isn't going to be so good.   People don't like waiting in lines. </p><p>You know, balderdash or whatever -- that's not true.  People love Black  Friday, they love going out.  And now a lot of it is on Thursday.  Oh my  gosh, don't open on Thursday -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They hate their families, Jerry -- that's why they want to get  out of the house.  Not that they love shopping, they really can't stand  their Aunt Myrtle from Omaha.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this year they'll be talking politics.</p><p>STORCH:  There are a hundred lines on Black Friday looking at consumers,  talking to them -- people are happy, they're having fun, it's a form of  entertainment.  And it is not going away.  </p><p>FORBES:  So shopping malls are going to be with us forever?  </p><p>STORCH:  You know, they're going to change.  So the best shopping malls are  migrating rapidly, I'm sure you have malls near you that are like that,  with really nice restaurants, alternative forms of entertainment, little  specialty shops that are not quite the big department stores.</p><p>What's going to change is that these big hulking department store anchors  are in big trouble.  So you see, you know, Sears is basically gone.   Penny's, that report last week was devastating.  I mean, it was not good.   So there are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're really bifurcated.  </p><p>STORCH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the anchors now are like Cheese Cake Factory and Dick's  Sporting Goods.  </p><p>STORCH:  And the movie theater.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the health care, lots of health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And by the way, I just want to point out Aerie, which is  part of American Eagle, is the best store.  That is going to be -- it's for  women.  It's like underwear, essentially.  </p><p>STORCH:  So, I'm glad you mentioned, because another big thing in retail is  that those who are vertical, who make their own product, who design,  manufacture and source their own products, they have a huge margin to play  with and it can't be competed away by Amazon.  Because Amazon won't carry  it unless they sell it to them.  So, it really pays off to be vertical like  that and to have a distinctive confidence and a distinctive skill and to do  it well.  You can make money no matter what.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, we all miss Toys 'R' Us.  Everybody is trying to  buy their assets right now.  </p><p>STORCH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any though -- I mean, what a shame.  </p><p>STORCH:  It is a shame.  I think you're going to see a lot of that product  picked up.  I think that's one of the reasons why Target's going to have a  great Christmas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STORCH:  Wal-Mart's going to have a great Christmas, Amazon going to have a  great Christmas.  There's toys, babies, video games, business that have to  go to different places.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STORCH:  You know, it's billions of dollars thrust back on to the market.   You know, I wouldn't want to be a toy manufacturer this year because it  won't all be recovered.  But it's going to be a great time for their former  competitors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jerry, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for your  insights.  </p><p>STORCH:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Greta insights from Jerry Storch this morning.  </p><p>Coming up, election closed, Florida's votes are finally counted and an  official certification is on the way.  More on that coming up, we'll bring  you the latest.  </p><p>Then, free food for life.  Chick-fil-A granting this loyal World War II  veteran all the chicken he can eat.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 20th.   Your top stories right now 07:34 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures headed lower again this morning.  Looking like another tough  opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials down 211 points right  now, the S&amp;P is down 25, and the NASDAQ is down 88.  </p><p>This after a red day on Wall Street yesterday, sliding across the board for  the major indices, the Dow Industrials gave up 395 points at the close, 1- 1/2 percent lower and that was actually off of the lows.  It had been down  500 earlier.  S&amp;P was down 45 at the close 1-2/3 percent lower and the  NASDAQ the hardest hit of all, down 220 points yesterday, better than three  percent lower on the NASDAQ yesterday.  </p><p>Google parent Alphabet joining Facebook, Amazon and Netflix in bear market  territory yesterday.  Apple just shy of the bear market territory as well.   As you can see, they were all down sharply and are in bear market  territory.  Apple is down again this morning in the premarket.  It is down  better than two percent right now.  The iPhone maker getting hit in the  premarket after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the stock from 209 to  182.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, declines there as well.  As you can see, the FT-100  is down 30 points that's a half a percent lower.  The CAC Quarante in Paris  is down better than one percent, 52 point lower.  And the DAX Index down  121 points, better than one percent lower in Germany.  </p><p>Asian markets closing lower overnight as well.  Worst performer Shanghai  Composite down better than two percent.  </p><p>Retailers are reporting earnings this morning, Target out with a mixed  report.  The company beating on revenue estimates but missing on earnings.   The stock is down sharply this morning as are many of them.  Best Buy also  hitting the tape this morning.  The electronics retailer out with a double  beat, TJX and Barnes &amp; Noble still to report this morning.  We will bring  you those numbers as they come out.  But again, many of the stocks are  taking a hit in the premarket.  </p><p>Honored by Chick-fil-A, a fast food chain celebrating a World War II  veteran with a special tie to the restaurant.  We'll tell you about it  coming up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.  But first, this top story this half an hour,  the court ruling hitting the border, a federal judge in San Francisco is  barring the United States from enforcing the Trump administration's asylum  ban.  This as congress faces a rapidly approaching December 7th deadline to  fund the federal government, avoiding a partial shutdown.  The president's  border wall set to be a major point of contention.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Texas Congressman Jodey Arrington.  And  congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much you for  joining us.  </p><p>REP. JODEY ARRINGTON (R), TEXAS:  Happy early Thanksgiving, Maria.  Good to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you as well, Happy Thanksgiving.  Your reaction to this  judge banning the asylum seekers?  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  Well, it's the law clearly supports the president.  The  immigration and nationalization act, if you read the plain language, he has  the authority to suspend aliens from coming off all kinds and classes as he  deems appropriate and necessary.  I think this is just another activist  Obama judge with no surprise coming out of the sanctuary state of  California to try to tie up the president a and stymie his efforts to do  what?  To do his job and defend the sovereignty of this country and protect  the American people.  </p><p>So, he's doing everything he can with the tools that he has and the  authority he has to do that first job and that's keep Americans safe and  put American citizens' interest first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe but the judge is winning here, right?  I mean, they've  ruled this.  What's the next catalyst to turn this around?  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  Well, I mean, he's going to lose on appeal.  I mean, the law's  clear.  It's unfortunate that you can legislate from the bench and stymie a  president, again, doing his job.  But I think this highlights also, Maria,  the importance of not just keeping the Senate in Republican hands but  improving our position because changing that judiciary at the federal  level, both the lower courts, the appellate and the Supreme Court is  critical to the future of this country and certainly the most long-lasting  legacy for this president.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ARRINGTON:  So I think this highlights that as well.  </p><p>FORBES:  Congressman, about that order, can you get a stay of that order by  going to another judge or a Supreme Court justice?  They sometimes put a  stop to this until the thing is finally adjudicated.  Because this is a now  thing, not something six months from now.  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  Sure.  I'm sure the president and the administration will  exhaust all efforts to put a stay on this.  He's already --you know,  directed the military to support the border patrol which I thought was the  right approach.  This is a national security issue.  So, I'm sure they'll  exhaust all avenues to ensure that they can do their job and support the  border patrol to stop the folks coming over here, exploiting the loopholes  in our law, particularly the asylum policies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was a -- on Wall Street Journal has a long story,  congressman, today about the U.S. slashing the number of migrant border  crossings.  And on Monday, for about three hours during the morning rush  hour, that the kind of busiest entry point between Tijuana and San Diego  was shut down and that was -- it was closed and that was in response to  intelligence reports including from the Mexican government that groups of  migrants from the caravan planned to rush the border through the automotive  lanes.  This is according to a senior Department of Homeland Security  official.  And that led to the closure.  </p><p>So again, the more this goes on, many American people if not most look at  this and say this is our border, it's our right to defend it and decide who  gets to come in and who doesn't.  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  Well, that's right.  I mean, it's a crisis.  I think it's been  a crisis for some time.  It's unfortunate.  And one of the biggest  disappointments that I've had in my first term was not negotiating in good  faith, the Democrats didn't, to get the immigration reform which would have  closed the loopholes, given the president what he needed to secure the  border and stop illegal immigration.  But the Democrats they didn't had  faith.  They said if we take care of DACA, that they would go in with us,  we did that and we didn't get a single vote.  Not only one, but on both  pieces of legislation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but are you going to see -- are you going to see any  changes to that, given the fact that now they're in the majority?  I mean,  look, we should point out that we still don't know the leadership on the  left at this point.  I know that the Republicans have done their leadership  races and we have a clear idea of whose running things.  But 16 Democrats  are opposing House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi's bid for House speaker.   They are stating they, quote, are committed to voting for new leadership.  </p><p>I recently spoke with Congressman Tim Ryan who signed this letter of  descent.  Here's what he told me on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" right before  the midterm elections.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (R), OHIO:  We've got a couple more days.  There are a number  of candidates that are having conversations that are talking about running.   I will say it's not going to be a coronation.  Somebody is going to run for  leadership.  I think it's important that we have this discussion and have  this conversation.  I think the American people want a change.  I think a  lot of Democrats want a change.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's the impact here if we do see them push for Nancy  Pelosi to not get the speaker and are you seeing any opportunity to come  together on immigration?  You just said you had a plan for DACA but the  Democrats wouldn't do it.  Not like you're going to be able to get that  done in the next two years, right?  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  Well, I don't hold a lot of hope out for the lead -- the  Democrats to lead on this issue.  I think they want amnesty.  I think they  like the open borders situation.  They won't state that publicly.  Most  people won't.  Although some will say they want to abolish ICE.  That's how  radical the left part of the party wants to go and take this country.  </p><p>Then you've got the sort of centralist people in the party and then you've  got the establishment sort of Nancy Pelosi who by the way, I see no  scenario where she doesn't get the gavel and she's not the leader of the  party.  She did way too much to raise money in support of this Democrat  victory to take the House back.  I think she's going to be an  obstructionist in her agenda, in her leadership.  But that's -- maybe some  see that is better than the radical left of the sort of socialist open  border amnesty views of Cortez and others, sort of the new socialist  Democrats.  </p><p>So either way, I think the American people are going to get a pretty clear  stark contrast between not only the policies but the governing style of the  Democrats versus the Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right congressman, we'll be watching of course.  Good to  see you this morning, thanks very much.  </p><p>ARRINGTON:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Jodey Arrington joining us there.  </p><p>Coming up, an angel loses its wings, Victoria's Secret replacing its CEO.   Cutting the dividend the stock is sliding this morning 7-1/2 percent lower  right now.  </p><p>Plus, Disney another step closer to finalizing the deal to acquire 21st  Century Fox Assets which is the parent company of Fox Business.  Details  next, right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, it has been two weeks of recount chaos in  Florida but now the midterm election results will be certified today.   Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, the certification  ceremony scheduled for this morning.  Republican Governor Rick Scott beat  Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in the Senate race after a hand recount.   Scott's win gives Florida two Republican senators for the first time in  more than a century.  And former Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis won  the governor's race against Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum after a machine  recount was completed.  </p><p>Well, Chinese regulators without conditions have approved Disney's plan to  buy major assets of 21st Century Fox, the parent company of this network.   Disney's CEO Bob Iger says the acquisition now could close quote,  meaningfully earlier than expected.  The $71 billion deal is a key part of  Disney's shift towards streaming services to compete with Netflix.  Shares  of Disney up eight percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Victoria's Secret is getting a new CEO.  The lingerie retailer hiring  John Mehas, who is currently president of Tory Burch.  He's going to  replace Jan Singer.  The corporate parent L Brands' trying to raise  earnings and pump up the popularity of the brand.  They plan to cut their  annual dividend by the way to $1.20 a share, that starts with the March  payout.  Taking a look at shares of L Brands, it's actually down in the  premarket substantially, almost 7-1/2 percent.  </p><p>And then there is this, Chick-fil-A is honoring a World War II veteran with  free food for life.  Ernie is a 92-year-old vet, he lives in Ohio.  He is  no stranger to this restaurant.  He's been eating lunch there every weekday  for the past year.  He says the chicken nuggets are his favorite.  And he  gets a root beer to go along with it.  Also an employee from Chick-fil-A  usually keeps him company during his meal.  And if you're 92 years old you  should eat all the chicken you want.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is so great.  Beautiful.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, getting a jump start on your holiday shopping, we've  got some of the hottest toys hitting the market this season in studio.   Wait until you see them.  Don't miss it.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Checking markets here, we are at the lows of the  morning, things are worsening.  Dow Industrials down 261 pounds right now,  that is down better than one percent.  The NASDAQ is down 110 points, 1-2/3  percent after a three percent selloff yesterday.  It's going to be a down  opening obviously for the broader markets as this market extends  yesterday's losses.  One issue is that the market did not close at the low  yesterday, came back to close down 395 points, had been down better than  100 -- I mean, better than 500, rather.  So, we are looking at that  extension this morning.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the holidays are almost here, ahead of Thanksgiving on Thursday,  you will want to grab the sweet toy deals before they're all gone.  Joining  us right now is the Toy Insider editor-in-chief Marissa DeBartolo.

You  know, we had the loss of Toys 'R' Us, but the other retailers are really  stepping it up.  And we've got lots of great toy deals to offer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So one of (INAUDIBLE) -- and these names are funny.  </p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holly and Jolly Fingerlings with exclusive mini Merry.  What is  exclusive?  Tell us about this one.  </p><p>DEBARTOLO:  So, this one is going to be exclusive at Wal-Mart for $29.99 on  Black Friday.  So, you've got two Fingerlings, Holly and Jolly.  You turn  them on underneath their little hats here.  And then you also have -- so  they're very festive.

So, $29.99, Wal-Mart exclusive and this is going to be one of  those fast items to sell out.  So, you better grab it right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it, all right.  So then you've got the Hatchimal,  Hatchiebabies Foxfin.  These can hatch without you.  </p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Yes, so these actually hatch on their own Hatchimals, but the  Foxfin is going to also be exclusive to Wal-Mart for $34.88.  So, it's  originally $59.99.  So a great price point for Black Friday.  And it's a  breed that you can't get anywhere else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this just hatches like this?</p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what this is and then it comes down.  </p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Yes, hatches right out of its egg and then you get to take care  of your little forever baby friend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cute.  The hat game is named the Chow Crown.  This is a  competition game?</p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Yes, so, Chow Crown is a super fun food frenzy.  So, you wear  the crown on your head.  You attach a little snacks to it on the ends here  and then you have to try to catch each snack in your mouth.  And the player  who gets the most is going to be a winner.  So, really great Instagramable  moments.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is so cute.  All right, next up is the Pikmi Pops FlipMi  Super Flip and they are scented.  </p><p>DEBARTOLO:  Pikmi Pops, yes, you got it.  So, this looks like a giant piece  of cotton candy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.</p><p>DEBARTOLO:  But it actually flips into this cute little plush friend here.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Tuesday, November 20th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  Global markets are in sell-off mode and we are at the lows  of the morning right now.  Looks like it's going to be a 300-point sell-off  right out of the gate this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials right now down 288 points.  Better than one percent lower  on the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500.  The NASDAQ down 115 points right  now.  That's 1-3/4 percent lower extending a sharp decline of yesterday.   Take a look at the damage yesterday with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 were both  down roughly 1-1/2 percent apiece but the real weakness was technology and  the NASDAQ slid three percent on the session 220 points lower yesterday.</p><p>This morning is no different, we're looking at declines across the board  and some of the biggest names in the sector and the premarket, Facebook  down two percent, Amazon down almost three percent as is Apple.  Netflix  down better than three percent.  Alphabet, parent of Google down almost two  percent down across the board on tech.  Global markets are following the  U.S. lower.</p><p>European Indices are down across the board, the FT-100 down a half of a  percent, 34 points lower.  The CAC Quarante in Paris down better than one  percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany down 1-1/4 percent right now.  In  Asia overnight, declines across the board as well as you can see there.   Meanwhile, from the tech wreck to the retail route, Target, Lowe's and  Kohl's all under pressure this morning on earnings.</p><p>Target and Lowe's same-store sales missed expectations.  Kohl's stock is  down almost 10 percent right now.  9-1/2 percent down on Kohl's, reporting  better-than-expected results and raising guidance.  The people are not  happy with the same-store situations.  Target down 9-1/3 percent as you can  see there.  Lower's down six percent, down across the board.  Meanwhile,  the future of the Renault-Nissan Alliance hangs in the balance this  morning.</p><p>Leaders from France to Japan, looking to take action following the shocking  news of the arrest of Carlos Ghosn.  We have the very latest this morning.   The ultimate gift guide.  Courtesy of  Gwyneth Paltrow.  You won't believe  some of the items on goops list from marble dumbbells to an entire Spanish  village.  Yes.  We've got it for you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes media chairman and  former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes and CFRA investment  strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good to be here.  Man,  that retail, those same store sales numbers are weaker than expected, those  retails are down worse than techs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And meanwhile, we just had on the former CEO Toys\"R\"Us  who said it's going to be a terrific black Friday, terrific fourth quarter.   So what are missing here?  </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think that -- well, some of these same-store sales numbers  came in just slightly below expectations but I think what the problem is we  look out to the fourth, last year was a blockbuster fourth quarter.  So the  question is, are we going to be able to beat those exceptional numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  The CEOs of these companies feel very good about it but then also I  think people worried about inventory and most importantly, Steve, you  pointed this out earlier, we're getting to 2019, tariffs that they got from  10 percent to 25 percent if they go on the additional 267 billion that's  left out there, then we're going to have major problems at retailer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Jerry Storch made the -- made the comment that it's really  margins under pressure for these companies.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  If you have to raise  prices, that's great but the margin pressure comes if you have tariffs  slapped on your goods that you're importing from China, and then you can't  raise the prices that puts pressure on your with margins and then also that  -- you have company -- again, it's not just about consumer prices and the - - oh your little can of soup isn't going up that much.</p><p>It's about essentially disrupting business and introducing uncertainty  where there wasn't any, to a vast array of businesses in this country.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Yes.  Huge complicated supply chains  are going to be disrupted.  These tariffs are going to hit profit margins  saying, yes, will consumers pay more, will consumers don't like to pay  more?  That's going to impact them next year.  And the longer they allow  this trade thing to drag out the worse it's going to be.  And the markets  in unmerciful mood, any slight thing and they will smash you, not good  sign.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We got all of that coming up this morning.  Joining the  conversation this hour, former White House Secretary Sean Spicer is here.   The founder and partner of Activate, Michael Wolf is going to walk us  through what's going on with technology and media.  And the host of Varney &amp; Varney, Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We  got a big hour coming up right here.</p><p>We kick it off right here with the tech wreck taking a toll on Wall Street.   Lauren Simonetti is on the floor of the New York Stock exchange with that  and the retail rout this morning.  And Lauren, technology took the market  down sharply yesterday.  Looks like it's doing the same this morning.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Basically since Apple  reported their latest earnings, investors are saying what is going on with  Apple and we keep getting new news every day.  The news today is Goldman  Sachs came out and they cut their price target on the stock to $182 from  $209.  Why is that important?  Well, that would be bear market territory.   Apple is near bear market territory right now but down in the premarket, it  probably gets there by the end of the day.</p><p>Two things they noted, Goldman says there is weakness in demand for Apple  products in China, and the 10R is not being well-received thus far.  Let's  talk about retail getting killed today and a lot of the stores that are  reporting here saying, why are they getting killed?  Let's talk about  Kohl's n general.  Good news it's being sold.  They raised their forecast,  double beat but the stock is down and down in a big way.</p><p>Same-store sales a little bit light, investors also might have wanted more  from that increase, forecast for earnings on the year.  Target, the CEO  comes out and says they are better position for this holiday than ever  before.  They grew their e-commerce sales 49 percent but with that  fulfilling those orders, their margins are getting squeezed, this stock is  getting hit hard and Lowe's is down in a big way as well.  Maria, back to  you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  We'll be watching what  all this means for the open which we are looking at now, could be a 300- point selloff in the Dow Industrials at the opening of trading in an hour  and half.  Meanwhile, new rules at the White House.  White House Press  Secretary Sarah Sanders releasing new mandates that news conferences which  state this.</p><p>Journalists will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to  others.   A follow-up question may be permitted at the discretion of the  President.  Failure to respect these rules may result in suspension or  cancellation of a journalist's hard pass.  This outline of course coming  after officials dropped the effort to suspend CNN reporter Jim Acosta's  press pass.  </p><p>Joining us right now is former White House Press Secretary under President  Trump, America First action PAC, senior advisor and author of the briefing  book, Sean Spicer.  Sean, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us  this morning. </p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning.  Thanks for  having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  New rules after the whole Acosta mess, a couple of weeks ago.   What's your reaction to all of this?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think it's sad and unfortunate that it's come to this.   You have to mandate professional behavior and decorum because a few bad  apples are trying to make it about themselves and make a show of what is  supposed to be an opportunity for journalists to ask the President  questions.  As you saw at that press conferences up 100 plus members of the  media from all sorts of backgrounds and publications that are seeking to  ask the President of the United States a question.</p><p>And yet one journalist in particular wants to monopolize it for himself and  make it into the Acosta show.  So I think in the past, there have been sort  of unwritten rules in terms of how you behave respect the office of the  President.  This one individual is clearly blown through them now we have  come to the point we've got to treat them looks like children rules and now  we've come to the point where we've got to treat them like children.</p><p>And put down rules and regulations so that people can actually behave and  it's not just about the President, right?  I think mostly comes out to  treating other journalists with the respect that they deserve. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think there's anything negative to have certain rules  for decorum when you're speaking to the office of the President.  I mean, I  don't -- what do you guys think?  I mean, I want to stand with journalist  but at the same time I think there should be a respect for office of the  President. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But if the White House had done this first Sean and just said,  here are the rules of conduct that we're going to lay out rather than just  pulling the guy's hard card.  Again, you kind of -- you end up losing, you  know, losing that initial battle.  This happens over and over again where  it seems like that somebody at the White House is behaving rationally and  not stepping back in taking a breath which quite frankly the President just  done when Jim Acosta was trying to grab that mic or keep the microphone  from that young woman.</p><p>If he just stepped back and folded his arms and said nothing and said, I'm  ending this press conference in five minutes unless Jim Acosta sits down,  again, he would have won and it wouldn't have be a win for Jim Acosta. </p><p>SPICER:  Yes.  I think that's partially right and -- but I --and as I said  at the outset, I think it's unfortunate that it's come to this because you  won't -- you've been able to exist all along without having to go this  route.  I think that what it's going to mean is -- you know, I agree with  Dagen in the sense that I don't know why he called him in the first place.   But if you don't call on him then they -- then they do the antics as well  and they start going, I haven't been called on any yells and he jumps up  and down and disrupts them in the first place.</p><p>So the court basically said that the CNN in this case, Jim Acosta had a  Fifth Amendment right to due process.  So the White House is basically  complying with the court order and saying great, then we will have a  process, put in place, we will notify them what the -- what the rules are,  and what the procedures will be if you violate them.</p><p>But this is a result of a court order that said that in this particular  case, that there was not necessarily a first amendment right to enter the  White House but that there was a Fifth Amendment due process rule to ensure  that there was a way to know that what they violated and that there were  rules so that they could follow in the first place. </p><p>FORBES:  That gets to the whole thing, Sean, and that is -- there's no law  that says the White House has to have these press conferences, they can set  the rules any rules they want.  And so the court I think was stretching  things.  The White House can could whatever it wants on the - on the -- on  press availability with the press. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that but CNN has been criticizing and poking  President Trump for the last two years.  And then he fights back and then  it's like this big thing fighting back. </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think this makes it just these press conferences much more  orderly.  This is how corporate earnings calls go for a lot of these bigger  companies you get one question and you move to the next analyst. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>BELL:  What's so wrong with that? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>SPICER:  Yes, I mean -- and look, and here is the thing, it's just -- I  think it's sad and unfortunate all around because I think Steve is right,  you don't have to have a press conference, you don't have to call on  reporters, you don't have to do a lot of things but I think it's good for  democracy  that the President of the United States from time to time gets  up and as he does so often engages with these members of the press so that  they can ask their questions.  I think it's good for -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know about that.  I mean -- I mean, we are living  in America where we have free speech and we are, you know, I mean they have  to answer reporter's questions.  I'm not saying that.  I mean, when you say  they don't have to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>SPICER:  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess so.  But you do have to speak to the press.  You  do have to --</p><p>SPICER:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you know, answer questions.  I'm just saying the way that he  put on such a show that it was all about him I think there should be a  level of decorum at the White House. </p><p>SPICER:  I agree and that's what I'm -- I think that we should engage with  the press, it's very healthy for democracy, it's great for the rest of the  world to witness us doing this but I think at some point, here is what is  think is missing in this discussion and I think it was sad and opportunity  was missed by both CNN and the White House Correspondents Association which  is this, they should have come forward and say, you know what, we believe  in a free press.</p><p>We believe in access, we believe in transparency, but we also acknowledge  that there are rules of decorum and professionalism that should stand as  the model for our industry of journalists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  And they failed to do that and I think that that speaks volumes  about the state of journalism today where they defend this kind of  inappropriate unprofessional behavior that is not only disrespectful to the  President of the United States but disrespectful to other journalists. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's right.  And let me -- let me get to this because  there's so much dishonesty going on around this story as well.  In fact, I  saw it, I have to say on CNN this morning and it was incredibly dishonest.   Ivanka Trump's lawyer is slamming this report that is alleging that the  President's daughter used her private e-mail for government business.  Her  attorney says, Ivanka followed protocols like those who transitioned into  government before her.</p><p>His statement reads in part.  To address misinformation being pedaled about  Ms. Trump's personal e-mail, she did not create a private server in her  house or officer.  There was never classified information transmitted.  The  account was never transferred our housed at Trump organization.  No e-mails  were ever deleted and the e-mails have been retained in official account in  conformity with records preservation laws and rules.</p><p>So, the bottom line is CNN this morning was going crazy about this  hypocrisy that Ivanka Trump used a private e-mails.  The issue around  Hillary Clinton was the fact that she had a server in her home, so there  was nothing stopping her from just deleting anything she wanted because  they weren't in White House, Sean.  So again, so much dishonesty in the  media about this story.  What's your reaction, Sean?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, exactly, but actually I think the bigger issue was Hillary  Clinton was transmitting sensitive and classified information on an  unsecured nongovernment e-mail, that was the bigger thing and then she  tried to cover it up.  And here is the thing that's interesting in that  statement.  Understand one thing that what is important about the statement  that Ivanka's lawyer issued is that if you use a private e-mail which  you're right. Maria, many government officials do.</p><p>The question isn't whether you use it, it's whether or not you forward it  your government e-mail or preserve it, that's the key so that the  government has a record of government transactions occurring.  So it's not  a question of using it or not, there are rules about using a personal e- mail in government service and it's just ensuring that if you do conduct  government business even if it's just routine correspondence then it's  actually housed and maintained for the presidential records act and other  applicable laws which she did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You can't have a record of it if the server is in your  basement.  Sean, thank you.  Sean Spicer.</p><p>SPICER:  You bet, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back in a moment with Carlos Ghosn and the (INAUDIBLE) shake- up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The fallout is continuing this morning following  the arrest of Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  Cheryl Casone with the details  and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  Ghosn -- well, we  should add to this now.  France's finance minister says that he should no  longer lead Renault as the company's CEO and chairman.  Renault's board  reportedly going to meet today to discuss his replacement.  Nissan set to  fire him later this week.  Ghosn is taken into custody of course in Japan  yesterday for allegedly reporting a salary and there are other charges of  financial misconduct.</p><p>Now, Ghosn's arrest also raising questions about the Renault-Nissan  Alliance which sells more than 10 million vehicles a year.  Board of  Ghosn's arrest in Japan hitting Asian stocks hard today.  Shares of Nissan  closed down nearly six percent yesterday.</p><p>Well, California's raging wildfires now responsible for 82 deaths, 700  people are still missing with crews warning some people may never be found  due to intensity of the flames.  Some relief though could be on a way, four  to six of rain is in the forecast but officials are worried about these  heavy downpours because could trigger mudslides and already devastated  areas.  </p><p>Well switching gears, \"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL,\" pretty cool last night.  The  Los Angeles Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs honoring the first responders  that worked tirelessly to combat the wildfires as well as those were first  on the scene at the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill shooting back on November 7th.   Now the game itself, the Rams came up on top in the highest scoring \"MONDAY  NIGHT FOOTBALL\" game ever.  The final scores, Rams 54, Chiefs 51.</p><p>105 points.  That's the third most of any NFL game and it was the first  time two teams scored more than 50 in the same game.  I think Steve Forbes  said, where was the defense.  Good point, Steve. </p><p>All right.  Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop has released its gifts  guide for the holidays.  The annual list known for being eco parts,  nonsensical and expensive.  One item that made the list this year, marble  dumbbell.  It's 2.2 pounds, it's $100 for one dumbbell.  Then there's this,  a  banana lamp with a golden finish, that's $340 because he doesn't to pay  $40.00 for that and if you really want to spend a lot of money, Goop has an  entire Spanish village (INAUDIBLE) it can be all yours for just $172,000,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASONE:  The Ridiculousness starts now for Christmas.  Just letting you  know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No words.  </p><p>CASONE:  There will be more of these.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She apparently is bringing -- is inking a deal for Goop with  Netflix.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if you are -- if you are already annoyed by Gwyneth Paltrow,  prepare to be more annoyed.  Some of the garbage that Goop site has sold  over the years, it's just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, a marble dumbbell, I guess that's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Is that supposed to be like a statue, you're not using  the dumbbells.</p><p>BELL:  It's peeling crystals. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the banana peel with gold.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is me self-editing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't get me that for Christmas.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- you know what I will never --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You promise?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I promise to never, ever, ever buy you anything from Goop ever. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back.  Screen  time concerns.  We are breaking down the alarming report about how much  time Americans are spending glue to their phones.  What do you think?   Plus, Activate founder and partner, Michael Wolf weighs in on that and a  lot more.  Back in a moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tech revolution Activate's annual technology and  media outlook report forecast the most important trends to watch for 2019  transformation from e-commerce to smart camera, even sports betting.  The  report finds Americans will spend an additional 11 minutes a day, every day  with tech and media by the year 2022 bringing the total time per day spent  with technology to 12 hours, 32 minutes.</p><p>Joining me right now is the founder and writer of that report, Activate  founder and CEO Michael Wolff.  Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL WOLF, FOUNDER AND CEO, ACTIVATE, INC.:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Before we get to the report, your thoughts  on what's happening with this tech wreck.  You see companies like Amazon,  Facebook, Netflix falling out of bed as people worry about growth, any  thoughts? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I mean, first of all, they've lost cumulative over the last  six weeks, they've lost about $700 billion in value.  And so they drove the  market up and they're driving the market down.  There is a bunch of things  that are concerning people.  One of them is privacy and what's happened  with Facebook in the last couple -- really in the last couple weeks.  The  other is, of course, security.</p><p>And there is also concern like how much more growth can they go through.  I  believe that these companies are going to continue to grow, I think that  the biggest Black Friday bargain is Amazon because Amazon is going to  continue to grow, they're going to continue to add a lot of revenue.  And I  don't think that Facebook's privacy problems are really going to have much  of an impact on revenue.  I mean, they may have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  People may delete the app but with two billion users, advertisers  are hooked on Facebook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think.  That's where the growth is the economy.   So,  you know, we're seeing an investor reaction but really when you look at the  growth what's happening that's what you're writing about.  Let's talk about  your outlook report, the reports finding that we're spending more and more  time on technology.  What struck you most about this year's report?  </p><p>WOLF:  I think there are a couple things.  One of them is smart cameras  that the average American within three years is going to have 12 smart  cameras in their homes.  So we're talking about things like the ring  camera, others cameras in their kitchens that help really cook, the camera  on your car and what's fascinating as much as you might think people are  worried about privacy, in reality all of our research shows that the people  who were the most worried about privacy are the most likely buy a smart  camera or own one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, a smart camera is what?  Like that I could pull up the  cameras on my phone which a lot of people can do right now with their --  with their alarm systems, but the cameras talk to each other.  </p><p>WOLF:  The cameras talk to each other and it's not just the camera that  talks to you, it's the people within neighborhoods are linking the other --  their cameras and either looking at ring for example from Amazon has an app  that allows you to look at what's going on in your neighborhood and report  things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>WOLF:  And lot of it's going in to the processing using A.I., so you know  what's going on but you also can do a bunch of things that are predicting  the camera in your kitchen that helps you cook.  It's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  So the cameras talking to each other and  that's forming an intelligent network.  </p><p>WOLF:  And intelligent network, so it's not just the cameras in your homes,  the cameras in the car, so they go together, to all the cars can talk to  each other, they can talk to the cameras on light poles, they can talk to  the camera on your phone.  We're going to see a lot more intelligence in  the network and it's going to enable things like self-driving cars.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about E-commerce?  Let's talk there because E-commerce  growth dollars will surpass physical growth dollars from three trillion to  six trillion you write by 2022.  </p><p>WOLF:  It -- this year is the inflection point.  And so we've got e- commerce got dollars that are growing about 20 percent.  We've got physical  retail which continues to grow but only around two percent.  So we're going  to see consumers are going to be buying a lot more and the we've got -- if  you look at the biggest companies, it's -- the biggest is Alibaba, it's  followed by Amazon, then you go JD.com, and then you've got eBay.</p><p>And all of them are going -- are going to continue to see growth.  What's  fascinating is they're all marketplaces.  They're really not --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's interesting. </p><p>WOLF:  They're not actually holding inventory, they're just selling other  people's stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fascinating actually.  All right.  Online betting is  another item that's highlighted in the -- in the report.  Online sports  betting projected the industry to explode from six billion to 119 billion?  </p><p>WOLF:  119 billion, a lot of it is money that was illegally bet, and now  it's going to be coming online.  This is all the big tech companies are  going to benefit as well.  So sports leagues and E-sports, and by the way,  even the enterprise companies like Oracle.  So it's going to end up being  within three years about $35 billion in incremental revenue for tech and  media.  None of which is there -- so it -- today, so it really reflects my  optimism for the stocks and the growth in these companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where is the growth?  When you look at this whole space of  technology and media, what do you think are the most important growth  takeaways that we should understand about where this industry is going?</p><p>WOLF:  So, I think that we're still going to see a lot of advertising going  from traditional media into these -- into these companies.  We're -- it  certainly going to be E-commerce, it's going to be new devices like the  smart camera, still more home speakers and then finally we're going to see  a lot of video out there.  People -- we -- it's not just Netflix, it's  Amazon, it's Hulu, so many of these companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even Apple.  </p><p>WOLF:  Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're starting a streaming service.  </p><p>WOLF:  They're starting a streaming service.  I'm not -- I'm not convinced  that Apple is truly going to be a competitor to these others but YouTube  with Google is already -- they're already starting YouTube premium and so  it -- in each case it's new revenue streams coming in.  I mean, betting is  going to be enormous and we don't see this today in anybody's P&amp;L.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you see new policies, regulations putting a hamper on any of  this?  I mean, the growth stories are still in place, and yet these stocks  are falling out of bed because I think some people are worried about  regulation because these companies keep getting more powerful and more  powerful.</p><p>WOLF:  It's not clear that regulation can do much, I mean, we -- I recall  myself a technology determinist, which is anything people can do with  technology, they're going to do, so there can be regulations but these  industries are different, they're not like telecom where you're regulating  a pipe.  So, there's going to be some things I think that Facebook and  others are going to identify where advertisements come from because there  is this concern about people hacking elections, and it's not just foreign  or -- foreign companies or government, it's also within the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  But I'm not convinced there's going to be a lot of regulation, the  main thing is going to be the antitrust concerns, and the Time Warner  merger ultimately has gone through.  And a lot of that isn't just about  concerns about monopolies and control, a lot of it is just political.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You doubt -- I mean, I would expect that this is not going to  impact the innovation story because the innovation story is very much in  place.  I mean, the things that you've just brought up in terms of your  report show real innovation, whether it's smart cameras, the online  betting, or e-commerce.</p><p>WOLF:  Artificial intelligence is going to be a massive enabler across most  of these industries.  I think we're going to see a great deal more  functionality, even the phones.  We're at a point where the phone has  gotten very sophisticated would you could do with the phone is going to  continue to grow and continue to play a bigger part on people's lives.  And  there's a lot of money that's going to flow from other places that hasn't  been there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Michael, it's great to see  you so.</p><p>WOLF:  Great to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on another fantastic  report.  Michael Wolf, a founder of Activate.  We'll see you soon, Michael.</p><p>Coming up, technology titans tumbling.  We're watching Silicon Valley  giants this morning after yesterday's big selloff, and more selling this  morning.  And then, gift-giving guilt next.  Thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 20th,  your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the East Coast.  Futures headed  lower this morning.  Again, we're at the lows of the morning with a decline  of almost 300 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down  one percent.  We're expecting the S&amp;P to be down one percent as well.  And  the NASDAQ to be down almost two percent, out of the open, this morning.   NASDAQ is down 115 points right now.</p><p>Technologies stocks bringing the markets down, that's what happened  yesterday.  Google parent, Alphabet joining Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix  in bear market territory.  Apple, also, very close to bear market territory  this morning.  The technology giants hit in the premarket.  Goldman Sachs  cutting its price target on Apple from 209 to 182.  I'm not sure how to get  to 122 at Goldman, but stock is down 2-2/3 percent on that news this  morning.</p><p>European indices down across the board as well.  Take a look, we're looking  at selling, it's getting worse, down 33 points on the FT-100, half a  percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris down better than one percent.  And the DAX  Index in Germany down 1-1/4 percent right now, 135 points lower there.  We  are looking at Asian markets, also down across the board, closing lower  overnight, as you can see, down two percent apiece on Shanghai and Hang  Seng in Hong Kong.  </p><p>Retailers are reporting today, and the reaction from investors is not good.   Best Buy out with its better-than-expected numbers that beat both on  earnings and revenue compared to estimates.  TJX Companies also hitting the  tape moments ago, the company behind TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods also  missed on earnings expectations.  TJX is down three percent, and Ross  Stores is down almost eight percent.  We are also looking at the rest of  the sector, down across the board.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we just got a look at the housing market, the October housing  starts coming in slightly higher than expected, the building permit number  is slightly lower than expected.  We've got housing starts looking -- we  were expecting a weak showing here, Steve Forbes, but it looks to me like  it's a miss in terms of housing starts.  What's your take?</p><p>FORBES:  It is -- it is a mix, and once interest rates -- once people can  get used to four, five percent mortgages and this economy continues to  grow, so we get China out of the way, which I think we will, that market  will recover.  We forget we grew up with four or five percent mortgages.   And once that shock is over, I think housing will come back as the economy  comes back.</p><p>BELL:  I think, though, that the problem is that you have first-time buyers  going out there, and we've seen interest rates -- Dagen always point this  out -- in the mid-2016, the 10-year was at 1.16, something like that.  Now,  we're twice that.  So, that moved up so quickly makes a difference.  And if  you're a first-time buyer, you're looking at that change in interest rates,  and it makes a difference on your mortgage payments.  So, this isn't the  weakness in the housing market.  It isn't -- this is kind of a reminder,  it's nothing new.  The existing home sales we get tomorrow have been down  year-over-year for seven months in a row now.  And that the decline is  increasing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In order for like these houses to make sense at higher mortgage  rates, you look at a house like in Connecticut, it's for sale for a million  and a half dollars.  If you go back to mortgage rates that were eight  percent which is kind of the longer -- about in the ballpark of the longer- term average over the last several decades, eight percent mortgage takes  that home price -- what did it sell for in the early 90s -- less than  $400,000.  It was like a $300,000 house is now selling for a million and a  half dollars, so I think that you have to -- that's the grave worry here is  that housing prices, in order to move the inventory that's piling up in a  lot of places, they've got to come down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying put it in perspective, you're coming off at such  a rich time for prices.</p><p>FORBES:  But you're also going to see I think a real sharper divergence  between red states, blue states, i.e., high-tax states versus low-tax  states in this region, tri-state region.  Forget it.  You're just going to  be worse and worse.  You go to place like Texas, Florida --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you've lost your deduction in the high-tax states.</p><p>FORBES:  You've lost your deduction, and -- but Texas, Florida, I think  those places are going to still boom.</p><p>BELL:  It's just like the equity market, as interest rates go up, when you  have some of these assets that prices have gone up so significantly, so  quickly, they have to come back down, you know, when you have interest  rates rising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, what about this market in terms of retail, Lowe's  out earlier this morning beating expectations but Futures on the decline.   Look at the stock here, Lindsey, down 7-1/3 percent on lows, and you've got  all of the majors, even when it was a double beat or earnings better, even  a revenue was light, it was same-store sales that really triggered the  move, but they're all down across the board.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And same-store sales is a key.  When you look at Lowe's, their  same-store sales is up I think 1.5 percent.  Look at Home Depot in the  U.S., 5.4 percent same-store sales.  Meanwhile, Home Depot is also down.  I  think it was down three percent in the last week.  Lowe's was down nine  percent going into this earnings report, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the NASDAQ is down, what, almost 14 percent from the  highs, on the NASDAQ.  So, we're seeing, I mean, a serious correction  happening as we speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Amazon was in bear market, and it entered a bear market in  October.  Alphabet, Google's parent company also in a bear market now.  And  if you're talking about -- but this is -- this is moved way outside of  technology.  You were talking about how hard these retail stocks have been  hit going into this earnings report, Target since November, like early  November 11-9 is down -- was already down 10-1/2 percent, and then it's  down another almost 10 percent in premarket trading.  And this is for --  Kohl's was down 14 percent before today, Lowe's down, 12 percent decline  for TJX, Ross Stores down more than 11 percent.  This is before the rout  that you're seeing this morning, which is astonishing.</p><p>BELL:  But this morning, Kohl's -- like Target was still off like 20  percent going into this morning.  Kohl's was still up 30 percent year-to- date, going into this morning, so look at that versus the market.  And some  of these other sectors, and they were looking pretty good and maybe still  highfliers, so they're being brought down, too.  Even -- so, even the good  quality names.  And look, Target five percent comp that it's slightly  missed.  It was a -- that's an amazing number like Gerri said earlier.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  Well, the market tries to anticipate the future, and the future,  next year for the consumers is not going to be so good as this tariff thing  kicks in. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the issue.  And if you're worried about growth  going forward and you want to get out of some of these stocks and you want  to just allocation shift, you're going to sell what you can sell.  So,  you've got, what, Apple still up whatever you said, 30 percent. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, where's money been going or what have people  been buying, they've been buying treasuries which does seem to suggest  people are worried about what the economy and growth looks like moving into  next year.  So, they were -- the yield was down I think through yesterday,  six days in a row, and that's the longest winning streak for the 10-year  treasury, I believe in more than two years.  Let me go back 2016.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're worried about growth, you're going to sell what you can  sell and if you've got gains of 40 percent as some of these retail names or  tech names, well, take some profits.  Even in the face of good consumer and  a good economy now, there's a new Gallup Poll showing the approval of  President Trump handling of the economy is up, 53 percent of Americans  approve how the President is handling the economy.  Those are his best  numbers yet, up from a previous high of 51 percent.  So, how many people  have come on this show, Dagen, and said that things are going really well?   You had the head of shop -- international shopping says, it's going to be a  blowout fourth-quarter.  You had Jerry Stork (ph) saying it's going to be a  terrific Black Friday.  And yet, people are selling their holdings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- but some of what's going on, some of the nervousness,  some of the uncertainty among businesses is this self-inflicted wound by  this administration.  And Steve has talked about that all-year long, and it  is a -- trade is the problem.</p><p>FORBES:  We're talking during the break about Larry Kudlow that's going on  Stuart Varney.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  He says nice things about maybe something is going to happen with  China, you'll see this reverse.  If something does happen in that meeting  in a few days between Xi and Trump --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The G20.</p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) framework that they might negotiate, sentiment can  turn pretty quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>BELL:  The market needs to see more though than just talk, they need  action, they need a game plan on trade.  I think that the market is not  going to believe like some positive rhetoric out of the G20.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, Stuart  Varney is going to weigh in on the technology titans' tumbling this  morning.  Plus, gift-giving guilt.  Check this out, the shocking study on  the pressure to overspend during the holidays.  That's up next.  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We want to give you this market alert because  Futures are near the lows of the morning, again, just shy of them, Dow  Industrials down 350 points, 1-1/3 percent.  The NASDAQ is down 145 points  right now, that's better than two percent lower.  Yesterday, of course, the  NASDAQ was down three percent, the Dow was down two percent.  </p><p>Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.   And Stu, you say all of the news is bad news for the market.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, it's a perfect storm of  bad news, isn't it?  I mean, let me list some of the items here.  Number  one, the Democrats have won the house, so you're not going to get any new  stimulus for the economy for next year.  Number two, you got a global  slowdown, that is going to hurt us.  Three, no good news at this point from  the trade talks with China, that is a negative.  Four, Goldman Sachs says  that by the end of next year, we'll be growing at a less than two percent  growth rate.  That's not good.  Number five, most important, you've got a  tech sell-off and then some.  They did lead the market, now they don't, now  they're leading it down.  If you add them all up, we could be facing one of  those blowout situations, and if we are, maybe that sets up a buying  opportunity.  But everything points south at this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it seems like, at some point, it's going to be a big  buying opportunity, Stu.  I think you're right about that.  I mean, we're  seeing expectations of a slowdown in the economy, but how much slower -- I  mean, how significant will that slowdown be?  I mean, this has been the  issue for about a year now that people are saying things will slow down  considerably going into 2020.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, the people that we're talking to and you're talking to, are  looking more towards a 2-1/2 percent growth rate for next year.  That's  nowhere near recession, and it's not that bad.  It's a slowdown but it's  not that bad.  So, I think we may be setting up a really good buying  opportunity but we're not quite there yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>VARNEY:  You've got to see that just -- I forget the exact word for it, but  you got a blowout of sort -- capitulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  We haven't got that yet, but when we do, then maybe you see the  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not capitulation when a market closes off of the lows,  we were down better than 500 yesterday and we closed down 395.  So, I know  you're going to have a lot more on it in about 10 minutes, Stu, we'll see  you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes, Larry Kudlow, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry Kudlow is coming up.  That's going to be such an  important interview.  Join \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" as Larry Kudlow join Stuart  to talk about where we are in this economic story.</p><p>First though, a news alert as we go to break, Boeing reportedly canceling a  conference call on the 737 Max jet to discuss the systems on the model.   This is the same model involved in a Lion Aircraft that crashed.  Here's  what Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told me in exclusive interview earlier  this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING:  This is an ongoing investigation, so it  will take whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly,  again, we participate fully in these investigations, we provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  The  bottom line here is the 737 Max is safe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Boeing shares up -- down 3.8 percent right now.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Holiday shopping headache, a new bank rate  survey claims nearly half of Americans feel pressure to overspend during  the holiday season.  Parents feel the pinch even more with over half of  respondents with kids overspending.  Joining us now is Ramsey Solutions'  financial expert, author of the upcoming book, \"Everyday Millionaires,\"  Chris Hogan is here.  Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you avoid overspending?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, Maria, you have to start off with a plan.  Make a list of the  people that you're going to shop for, assign a dollar amount on what you  can afford to spend for that individual, and only spend that amount.  I  don't want people to wake up in January and have a holiday hangover for the  next 18 months, trying to pay off credit card debt when they bought things  they couldn't afford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That makes sense.  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Well, what about the ability to just take some people off your  list and just not get gifts?</p><p>HOGAN:  I don't think there's a problem with that at all, Lindsey, I really  don't.  If you can't afford to buy a gift, then be creative, think of ways  you can make a gift.  If they have kids, gift them with babysitting, take  them out for a dinner, or make someone a dinner.  We've got this mind-set  in America that we have to buy a gift in order to give a gift.  We can give  the gift of time or we can use our talents to be creative. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because when you give people something like I'll babysit your  kids, the recipient of that gift knows that that babysitter is never going  to show up, and then they're going to have a problem.  Again, it's the fact  that like at least a gift that you bought in a store is something tangible  that like, oh, I can use this bath bomb, not something that, you know,  well, I'm going to -- you know, I'll drive you to the mall when you need me  to.  It just never materializes.</p><p>HOGAN:  Dagen, you sound like you've stood some people up with babysitting  before.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- I don't babysit.</p><p>HOGAN:  But I think -- I think if you --</p><p>BELL:  You're cracking me up.  You're cracking me up.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, I think if you give them a certificate or something.  I just  don't want people to dig themselves further into a hole.  Spending in our  debt (INAUDIBLE) situation is pushing toward a trillion dollars.  This  holiday season is a season where people dig themselves into a hole, that  some of them still haven't crawled out from for the last three to four  years.  So, the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over  and over and expecting a different result.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HOGAN:  Let's approach this Christmas with cash, make this a cash  Christmas, and don't have financial regret.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, one way to do it, I won't mention a family member who does  it, and that is -- he has a great gift for recycling.  So, recycle some of  the presents --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, recycled gift.  You mean, regift?</p><p>FORBES:  Regift.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve Forbes, I know who it is.  Should I say who it is on  television?  It's --</p><p>FORBES:  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Forbes name has nothing to do -- it doesn't represent like  somebody who has an endless supply of money, they'll regift something that  they got in previous holiday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what's wrong with regifting if it wasn't used?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you were the -- </p><p>FORBES:  It's the thought that counts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's like I gave Steve a gift and he gives it back to me the  following Christmas, it's a little bit --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, that's a problem.  Chris, thank you, sir.  Happy  Thanksgiving, Chris Hogan.  We'll be right back.</p><p>HOGAN:  Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, everybody, great show.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great show.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day, everybody.  Let's get to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The New York-based company announced[3] a pilot program for Ghostery Midnight[4] in late October, and the subscription-based desktop app is now ready for prime time. Ghostery Midnight comes with a slew of features to protect users at the device level across all applications \u2014 including an ad blocker, tracker protection and monitoring, and \u2014 for the very first time in a Ghostery product \u2014 a virtual private network (VPN). While this launch is an indication of Ghostery's efforts to build a sustainable business model, it also signals changes in the browser landscape that have necessitated a shift to device-level protection. Google, in particular, has proposed major changes ('Manifest V3[5]') that would impact how third-party extensions work inside Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, sparking complaints that it will become much more difficult for ad blockers and privacy-protection tools to dynamically respond to threats at the browser level. </p><p>According to Ghostery, it was already internally discussing a device-level privacy product before Google's new Chrome proposals came to light, but the news may have expedited Ghostery Midnight's launch. 'Tracker protection in Ghostery Midnight works very similarly to our extension by detecting and blocking trackers from third-party companies, but this time at the device level,' Ghostery president Jeremy Tillman told VentureBeat. 'Midnight monitors network activity on an app-by-app basis, needing only access to standard permissions in the operating system used by similar applications.'The story so farNew York-based Ghostery came to fruition back in 2008[6] as a FireFox add-on that analyzes web pages for trackers[7]. In 2010, Ghostery was acquired[8] by behavioral advertising regulatory platform Better Advertising, which introduced the Ghostery extension to all the major browsers,[9] followed later by a dedicated mobile browser app. Although Ghostery has garnered some high-profile fans over the years, including U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden[10], it has also courted skepticism[11] for inviting users to opt into sharing ad-related data that it then sold to other companies. This business model was seen as problematic, given that Ghostery is built around privacy. So in 2017 Ghostery sold its trademark and main consumer technology to Cliqz[12], a Mozilla-backed[13] privacy-focused browser company based in Germany that later made Ghostery open source and announced a new business model[14]. For the past year or so, Ghostery has operated two new moneymaking schemes in beta. Ghostery Rewards[15] is an opt-in feature that notifies users about deals or special offers relevant to a site they're on \u2014 it's basically affiliate marketing, with Ghostery taking a cut of any sales it generates. Then there's Ghostery Insights[16], priced at $49 per month, which provides real-time web tracker analysis data for businesses. Back in January[17] Ghostery introduced its first consumer subscription plan in the form of Ghostery Plus, ushering in advanced features such as in-depth insights around trackers, priority support, and new themes for $2 per month. Ghostery Midnight builds on this with the introduction of a new premium subscription plan that costs $14 per month. It's worth noting that the service comes with a basic tier that protects up to two browsers for free. 'For years, we at Ghostery have been focused on protecting users and their data on the browser,' Tillman said. 'However, with impending changes in the browser landscape and privacy threats expanding at a device level, we're excited to debut Ghostery Midnight, featuring app-level tracker-blocking capabilities and our first ever VPN so users can feel protected at every level.' Here's a quick look at the main features Ghostery Midnight offers.Ghostery MidnightThrough the main Ghostery Midnight control panel, users can activate and deactivate the various features that work to protect the entire desktop. This includes a VPN, a tracker blocker, and an ad blocker, with additional 'quick stats' showing how many tracker requests have been blocked. Above: Ghostery Midnight control panel (Mac) Users can click on each desktop application to see what trackers are at play and which have been blocked. Above: Ghostery working with Chrome at the device level (Windows) Above: Ghostery detecting trackers inside Thunderbird The VPN offers six separate IP regions \u2014 two in the U.S. and individual ones for the U.K., Canada, Germany, and Singapore. Above: Ghostery VPN (Windows) If the user needs to temporarily deactivate their various blocking tools, they can choose to do so for 30 minutes, one hour, or 24 hours without having to manually turn off the features individually. Above: Pausing GhosteryThe privacy pushWhile cookies have served as an effective way of tracking users since the dawn of the modern web, they are easy to spot and block, which is why advertisers and other nefarious entities have sought new ways to identify and track users across websites. One such mechanism is 'fingerprinting,'[18] which works independently of cookies and allows advertisers (or anyone) to build a picture of an individual's browsing habits by monitoring signals such as the time zone of a machine, the screen resolution, HTTP headers, and more. Unlike cookies, fingerprinting is more difficult to spot, and anti-tracking tools typically feed from a database of known trackers. Ghostery maintains a proprietary tracker database that is updated regularly to detect and block trackers, and the company will leverage this same database for Ghostery Midnight. However, the Ghostery browser extension also uses more advanced anti-tracking technology[19] that leans on machine learning to spot new or otherwise unknown trackers that have yet to be added to any database. This isn't yet available inside Ghostery Midnight, but it will be thrown into the mix sometime next year. 'As everyday digital users, we're incredibly vulnerable,' Tillman added. 'Today's websites have dozens, if not hundreds of tracking technologies built into them. And, increasingly, modern desktop applications are using the same technologies to extend the reach of third-party tracking beyond your browser to include everything else you do on your device. This allows big tech companies like Google and Facebook, not to mention hundreds of smaller ones, to cast a bigger net to collect and monetize our data.' Ghostery Midnight is available to download now and comes with a free seven-day trial.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, \"I haven't eaten breakfast yet. Have you?\"</p><p>Since 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. It's set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the family's full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebook's headquarters.</p><p>Occasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep \"pushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.\" But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerberg's master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. \"We're not-pick your noncontroversial business-selling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,\" he told me, of his business. \"It's at the intersection of technology and psychology, and it's very personal.\"</p><p>He carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, \"I haven't clipped in since.\"</p><p>He and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. \"It gets extremely competitive,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.\" Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. \"He's not playing you in a game of Risk. He's playing you in a game of games,\" Morin told me. \"The first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. He's trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.\"</p><p>Across the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerberg's desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of Twitter, told me, \"He's a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, you're going to take a beating.\" Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, \"There are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that he's really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.\" Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. \"For many years, it was, like, 'Your LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though we're friendly, I don't want to get too close to you personally, because I'm going to crush you.' Now, of course, that's behind us and we're good friends.\"</p><p>When I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on \"network effects,\" in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, \"there's a natural zero-sumness. If we're going to achieve what we want to, it's not just about building the best features. It's about building the best community.\" He added, \"I care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But that's not primarily the way that I think I roll.\"</p><p>For many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation \"Domination!\" Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, \"dominance\" refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friend's daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerberg's program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, \"During the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.\"</p><p>If Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerberg's dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.</p><p>A couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precision-a business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.</p><p>For years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape people's behavior. The company's troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebook's automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as \"fake news.\" In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-Donald Trump Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to \"microtarget\" ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.</p><p>The other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia's role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an \"interference operation\" that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clinton's standing among Democratic voters. (One read \"Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote.\") With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.</p><p>At the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the company's role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the American Journal of Epidemiology, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebook's first president, called himself a \"conscientious objector\" to social media, saying, \"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.\" A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, \"The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works-no civil discourse, no co\u00f6peration, misinformation, mistruth.\" Palihapitiya, a prominent Silicon Valley figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, \"I feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.\" Of his children, he added, \"They're not allowed to use this shit.\" (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, \"Facebook was a very different company back then.\")</p><p>In March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the Times and the British newspaper the Observer reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using \"psychographic\" techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebook's history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebook's peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. Elon Musk deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, \"We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,\" but \"we've elected not to do that.\" At Facebook's annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerberg's renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read \"YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.\" It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.</p><p>On July 25th, Facebook's stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at Vanity Fair, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, \"double what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.\" Facebook's user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.</p><p>Zuckerberg's friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, Bill Gates, who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, \"Somebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.\" He added, \"I wouldn't say that Mark's an arrogant individual.\" But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, na\u00efvet\u00e9, and contempt for oversight.</p><p>In a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebook's problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.</p><p>Zuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, \"For a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.\"</p><p>Facebook's headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the \"Facebook fifteen.\") Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word \"Hack\" is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.</p><p>On Zuckerberg's campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebook's blockchain project, told me recently, \"When I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because it's not the guy he is.\" Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. \"He's not an asshole,\" a former senior executive told me. \"That's why people work there so long.\"</p><p>Before I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasn't necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politician's bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerberg's case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that \"my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,\" the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title \"Zuckerberg in rare emotional moment.\"</p><p>I asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.\"I'm not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,\" he said. \"I don't want to inflict that pain, or do something that's going to not reflect well on the people around me.\" In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the \"Recode Decode\" podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isn't sure if they are \"intentionally getting it wrong.\" After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial \"deeply offensive.\" Zuckerberg told me, \"In an alternate world where there weren't the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldn't have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.\"</p><p>The downside of Zuckerberg's exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year's resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a \"listening tour\" that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama's former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family's philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, \"When a politician goes to one of those, it's an hour, and they're talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.\"</p><p>But the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, \"No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebook's signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, told me, \"Sometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, 'Well, I've never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells me\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.'\u00a0\" She went on, \"He acknowledges he doesn't always have the most experience. He's only had the experience he's had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.\"</p><p>Long before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was \"a teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,\" a longtime friend told me. \"I think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.\" Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.</p><p>In Zuckerberg's case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailman's son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, \"He was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.\" Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, \"I am literally the Father of Facebook!\" (Since 2013, Zuckerberg's parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)</p><p>In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computers-the Atari 800, the I.B.M. XT-and Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his father's dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was \"beyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.\" When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. \"They came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,\" he said. \"Their dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.\" His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.</p><p>When Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (\"It's very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated that\") and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, \"You have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.\" For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.</p><p>\"What are the trade-offs in that?\" Zuckerberg said, growing animated. \"On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.\" On the other hand, he said, \"that didn't come for free, and he had to do certain things.\" In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, \"My wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.\" The couple named their second daughter August.</p><p>In 2002, Zuckerberg went to Harvard, where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. \"The 'fuck you' to those in power was very strong,\" the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (\"the\" was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (\"they 'trust me.' dumb fucks,\" he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.</p><p>During Zuckerberg's sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. \"I suddenly go to Harvard, where there's this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,\" she said. \"Then I met Mark, who so exemplified that.\" She was struck by how little Zuckerberg's background had in common with her own. \"Fifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,\" she said. \"I was just, like, 'This person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that I've never seen before.'\u00a0\" She added, \"Maybe there was some judgment on my part: 'You don't understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,'\u00a0\" but, she said, \"I had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.\" After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about Sitzfleisch, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. \"He'd actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,\" she said.</p><p>After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebook's first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said \"I'm CEO\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. bitch!\" Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisher's \"Valley of Genius,\" an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, \"\u00a0'How much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?' That's a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.\"</p><p>Facebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.</p><p>In Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, \"The Boy Kings,\" explained that the \"engineering ideology of Facebook\" was clear: \"Scaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.\" Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as \"growth hacking,\" the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about \"connecting people,\" that was, in effect, code for user growth.</p><p>Then, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldn't budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. \"You will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,\" he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency \"should not stand in the way of innovation.\"</p><p>Sandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as \"We believe in the religion of growth.\" He said, \"The Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the 'Growth X' or the 'Growth Y' to try to get people excited.\"</p><p>To gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a \"platform\" for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off users' messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, \"Do you really want to see what you'll find?\"</p><p>Parakilas told me, \"It was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.\"</p><p>New hires learned that a crucial measure of the company's performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7. \"You could say it's how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,\" Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. \"But, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about 'Well, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?'\u00a0\"</p><p>Facebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.</p><p>Sean Parker later described the company's expertise as \"exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.\" The goal: \"How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\" Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect people's political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an \"I Voted\" button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand people-more than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its \"I Voted\" button.</p><p>These powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, \"In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.\"</p><p>Facebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in \"persuasive technology.\" He explained, \"A hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasive-it doesn't have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.\" In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. \"I said, 'You guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,'\u00a0\" he told me. \"They didn't do anything about it.\" He added, \"My points were in their blind spot.\"</p><p>As Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friend's page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (\"Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.\"), and people got used to the feed.</p><p>\"A lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,\" Zuckerberg told me. \"If you think about the early narratives, it was, like, 'Well, this was just a college thing.' Or 'It's not gonna be a big deal.' Or 'O.K., other people are using it, but it's kind of a fad. There's Friendster and there's MySpace, and there will be something after,' or whatever.\" He added, \"I feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you don't know what you are doing.\"</p><p>In 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, \"Our growth had stalled out.\" Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. \"I think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,\" Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership \"left within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but that's a pretty powerful lesson.\"</p><p>On several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a user's friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (\"We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,\" he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.</p><p>Despite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a \"social norm.\" That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for \"engaging in unfair and deceptive practices\" with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a \"comprehensive privacy program\" and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: \"I think that a small number of high profile mistakes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have often overshadowed much of the good work we've done.\"</p><p>Facebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, \"Move fast and break things,\" which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerberg's longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, \"A failure can be a form of success. It's not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.\" In Zuckerberg's view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. \"There's always someone who wants to slow you down,\" he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. \"In our society, we often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can't keep us from starting.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie \"The Social Network,\" an account of Facebook's early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerberg's motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. \"First impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,\" he told me. \"My reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.\" His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about \"how is our company, how are our employees-these people I work with and care so much about-how are they going to process this?\"</p><p>Before the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, \"the movie.\" Sandberg, who is the company's second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerberg's most ardent defenders, told me, \"From its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.\"</p><p>While the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for Instagram, the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The Wall Street Journal called the I.P.O. a \"fiasco,\" and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. \"We got a ton of criticism,\" he recalled. \"Our market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.\" (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)</p><p>Zuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. \"Within a month, you literally can't meet with Mark if you're not bringing him a mobile product,\" Bosworth recalled.</p><p>In 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, \"Move fast and break things,\" to the decidedly less glamorous \"Move fast with stable infrastructure.\" Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didn't give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.</p><p>The incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebook's \"ugly\" physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: \"Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.\"</p><p>This spring, after the memo leaked to BuzzFeed, Bosworth said that he had been playing devil's advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: \"Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg was also experimenting with philanthropy. In 2010, shortly before the release of \"The Social Network,\" he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newark's struggling public-school system. The project quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, it's generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newark's mayor, said of the donation, \"You can't just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, 'This is going to fix everything.'\u00a0\"</p><p>For all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. \"Your earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,\" he said. \"There were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didn't work.\" Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. \"I think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,\" he said.</p><p>In 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune \"to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.\" They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiative's perspective. \"I think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,\" he said. \"You need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.\"</p><p>In contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) \"The whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a co\u00f6rdinated attack,\" Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanford's Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, \"There should be much greater transparency, so that it's not dark. That's not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. It's a criticism of the law.\"</p><p>In 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to \"help cure all disease in our children's lifetime.\" That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to \"cure, prevent or manage all diseases.\" The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerberg's presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, \"It's funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of 'Oh, that's obviously going to happen on its own-why don't you just spend your time doing something else?' And then a bunch of people have the reaction of 'Oh, that seems almost impossible-why are you setting your sights so high?'\u00a0\"</p><p>Characteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. \"On average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,\" he said. \"We're going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that we'll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like there's a reasonable shot.\"</p><p>I asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerberg's objectives. \"There are aspirations and then there are plans,\" he said. \"And plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.\" He added that Zuckerberg's long-range goal is \"very safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.\"</p><p>As Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The company's financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebook's WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the Times, \"The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.\"</p><p>Nowhere has the damage been starker than in Myanmar, where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the country's population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a \"Jihad against us.\" Others gamed Facebook's rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that \"when Muslims become the most powerful\" they will offer \"Islam or the sword.\"</p><p>Beginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a \"campaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.\" Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, \"I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.\" Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was \"hiring dozens\" of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.</p><p>More than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. \"We haven't seen any tangible change from Facebook,\" he told me. \"We don't know how much content is being reported. We don't know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.\"</p><p>I saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, \"I think, fundamentally, we've been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because it's actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.\" It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, \"Across the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.\"</p><p>I told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebook's resources has failed to heed their complaints. \"We're taking this seriously,\" he said. \"You can't just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.\" He promised that Facebook would have \"a hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,\" and added, \"I hate that we're in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.\" A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmar's Army chief and several other military officials.</p><p>Over the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, \"When you're running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as na\u00efve and uninformed.\" He went on, \"The problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.\"</p><p>The 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be \"a big deal in terms of ad spend,\" comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.</p><p>Facebook offered to \"embed\" employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton's campaign said no. Trump's said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trump's language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trump's descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.</p><p>During the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, it targeted three Democratic constituencies-\"idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans\"-sending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign's digital-content director, later told an interviewer, \"Without Facebook we wouldn't have won.\"</p><p>After the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerberg's staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. \"The idea that fake news on Facebook-of which, you know, it's a very small amount of the content-influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerberg's defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told Wired, \"We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn't, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.\"</p><p>When I asked Zuckerberg about his \"pretty crazy\" comment, he said that he was wrong to have been \"glib.\" He told me, \"Nobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.\" But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. \"I find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,\" he said. \"Because it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.\"</p><p>Shortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. \"The initial reaction was completely dismissive,\" he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. \"They were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,\" Warner said. \"It was getting better, but I still don't think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.\" Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, \"Most of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, don't get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then we'll go away.\"</p><p>Facebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.</p><p>In March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.</p><p>\"I feel like we've let people down and that feels terrible,\" he told me later. \"But it goes back to this notion that we shouldn't be making the same mistake multiple times.\" He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: \"The average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that we've seen so far suggest.\" He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. \"I actually don't consider that a closed thing,\" he said. \"I still think that's the kind of thing that needs to be studied.\"</p><p>In conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesn't accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreement-a fact, a methodology, a premise-and hammers at it. It's an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, \"They only want to hear good news. They don't want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of 'You go along to get along.'\u00a0\"</p><p>I once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. \"I probably mostly read aggregators,\" he said. \"I definitely follow Techmeme\"-a roundup of headlines about his industry-\"and the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.\" He went on, \"There's really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these days-most people don't read the physical paper-but there aren't many news Web sites where I go to browse.\"</p><p>A couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. \"I felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didn't necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,\" he said. \"I guess what I tried to convey, although I'm not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.</p><p>James\u00a0P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebook's headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteen-the minimum age to use the primary Facebook app-to make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. \"I respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,\" Steyer told me. \"They still seemed to be in denial. Would you 'move fast and break things' when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.\"</p><p>To some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the company's new stated mission to \"bring the world closer together,\" as well as to items on Zuckerberg's social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.</p><p>In September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. \"I was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,\" he said. \"I couldn't change the values. I couldn't change the culture.\" He concluded that measuring the \"true social outcomes\" of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. \"I think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,\" he said. \"But I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didn't feel great about the product. I didn't feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didn't feel I was helping the world.\" (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)</p><p>In March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebook's handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.</p><p>In barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the Wall Street Journal published an article that began, \"Imagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.\" It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty \"so powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.\" He called this the \"curse of bigness.\" Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeis's phrase, told me, \"Today, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.\" He added, \"When a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.\"</p><p>Shortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that \"the computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.\" Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted \"taunting\" regulators, saying, \"Not something I would choose to repeat.\" He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. \"I said, 'Get an office there-now.' And Mark did, and he owes me,\" Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.</p><p>On April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the Senate hearing, he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: \"Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we've solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.\"</p><p>As it turned out, nobody asked him to resign-or much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if \"users don't pay for your service.\" Zuckerberg replied, \"Senator, we run ads,\" allowing a small smile.</p><p>To observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiac-he said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow up-but when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebook's stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading \"Senator, we run ads.\"</p><p>When I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is \"extremely competitive,\" he told me. \"I think sometimes people get into this mode of 'Well, there's not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.' Well, actually, that makes it more competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.\" He acknowledged the deeper concern. \"There's this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?\" he said. But he argued that efforts to \"curtail\" the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. \"I think that anything that we're doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,\" he said. \"I wouldn't worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situations-in Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.\"</p><p>The rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, \"in the United States you're allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.\"</p><p>Facebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the European Union's top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Google's search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an \"illegal advantage\" to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the company's practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.</p><p>In Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presence-nearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. \"What we're dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,\" she said. \"Human decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something that's important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.\"</p><p>Vestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls \"unbalanced.\" She paraphrased those terms as \"It's your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.\" Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. \"Your children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,\" she said. \"But this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when it's digital.\"</p><p>In Vestager's view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. \"We need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,\" she said. \"You're more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.\"</p><p>As the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as \"auto-play\" videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote \"active engagement.\" In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, \"We can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.\"</p><p>The company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.</p><p>Samidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebook's \"election integrity\" work, told me that the revelations about Russia's Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. \"This wasn't the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,\" he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russia's model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. \"There are lots of copycats,\" Chakrabarti said.</p><p>Zuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of \"frictionless sharing,\" but these days Facebook is working on \"imposing friction\" to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama's National Security Council, to blunt \"information operations.\" In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.</p><p>As hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerberg's most intractable problem may lie elsewhere-in the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, \"acts of protest,\" and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving \"easier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.\"</p><p>The cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook \"content moderator\" was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a \"platform for all ideas.\" But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban \"hate speech\" and impose lesser punishments for \"misinformation,\" a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the Guardian last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say \"You are such a Jew\" but not permissible to say \"Irish are the best, but really French sucks,\" because the latter was defining another people as \"inferiors.\" Users could not write \"Migrants are scum,\" because it is dehumanizing, but they could write \"Keep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.\" The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as \"Not Protected\u00a0+\u00a0Quasi protected\u00a0=\u00a0not protected.\"</p><p>In July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerberg's lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook school massacre are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it \"reduced\" him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.</p><p>Then, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed \"Dear Mr Zuckerberg,\" in which they described \"living in hiding\" because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after \"an almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.\" In their view, Zuckerberg had \"deemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.\"</p><p>Facebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jones's videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company \"does not tolerate hate speech,\" stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jones's pages for \"repeatedly\" violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: \"I don't believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.\"</p><p>Jones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.</p><p>\"O.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,\" he said, homing in. \"The initial questions were around misinformation.\" He added, \"We don't take it down and ban people unless it's directly inciting violence.\" He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, \"When they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldn't just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.\"</p><p>It will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebook's free-speech dilemmas have no simple answers-you don't have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the company's extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on \"I know it when I see it.\" For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruz's standards, he quoted Martin Niem\u00f6ller's famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, \"As the poem goes, you know, 'First they came for Alex Jones.'\u00a0\"</p><p>Last week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, \"We now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.\" (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, \"Lean In,\" a best-seller on women's empowerment, and \"Option B,\" which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebook's board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. \"I know a couple of guys who are color-blind,\" a prominent executive told me, \"and their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they don't want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.\" He went on, \"If you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.\"</p><p>In one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. \"Insulting?\" he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. \"I don't find it insulting. I don't think it's accurate. I mean, I definitely care a lot. There's a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.\" He went on, \"Ultimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you don't do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.\"</p><p>The caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve \"problem after problem after problem,\" no matter the howling from the public it may cause.</p><p>At a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that he's now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebook's colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.</p><p>In some sense, the \"Mark Zuckerberg production\"-as he called Facebook in its early years-has only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his office-with the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobile-if they don't bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_0918_24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9H-88V1-DYWH-9008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"14137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

I do understand the need for a company to make money to provide free services, but the abuse of privileges suggests that things have gone too far.</p><p>It is ironic that a social platform would be the most egregious abuser of social contracts. Time and time again, the tech giants operate under the assumption that misuse of data is acceptable. Big tech needs to understand that the spirit of the end user licence agreement is more important than just adhering to the letter of the law of the agreement. Crossing this social contract boundary with users can have significant costs.</p><p>Consumers - knowingly or unknowingly - often trade the privacy and security of their data for convenience offered, but the plan to merge platforms in this way equates to abuse of access and assumed trust. Trust is so important, now more than ever in our society. Facebook and Google have breached our trust multiple times over the past year by allowing users' personal data to be sold or stolen.</p><p>We need them to earn back that trust and it won't be an easy process. A multifaceted approach is needed, including government regulations, self-policing, and consumer vigilance.</p><p>The time is now for these giants to not only accept their monumental impact on society, but to act on this awareness by finally defining what acceptable use is, and sticking to it.</p><p>Duncan Brown, chief security strategist EMEA, Forcepoint</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-146137663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBN-PNH1-DYTY-C3KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"287\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

The auditing industry, supposedly the most staid of professions, may be on the brink of a revolution. Or rather, if proposals that emerged this week from two reviews of the sector are implemented, it is about to be cut down to size, perhaps literally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global auditing business is dominated by four companies, PWC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte. This is not a new phenomenon: the industry has been consolidating for decades. Yet it has become increasingly problematic. A series of corporate collapses over the past 20 years, including Enron, Worldcom and Carillion, have been blamed, in part, on failings by their auditors.</p><p>The problem is not that any one auditing company caused any one collapse. It is a more general malaise: that auditors did not spot the dangers, or warn of them, or underestimated or misunderstood the risks embedded in those companies. A corporate collapse is destructive of shareholders, employees and societies. Enron's collapse even led to the fall of its own auditor, Arthur Andersen, in 2002. That turned the Big Five, as it then was, into today's Big Four.</p><p>These four are now so dominant in that, according to the UK Competition and Markets Authority, 97 per cent of large UK companies are audited by one of them. That has led to allegations that they are an oligopoly. Moreover, they have consulting divisions that offer advice on matters such as corporate restructuring and strategy to those same companies, in return for lucrative fees. Critics have long seen that as a conflict of interest.</p><p>Now there are plans to address this undue concentration. The CMA, the UK regulator for competition, consumer protection and mergers and acquisitions, has proposed that consulting be separated from auditing, that the chairs of audit committees on corporate boards be made more accountable, and that a smaller auditing firm work alongside a Big Four member at large companies.</p><p>A separate review by John Kingman, chairman of Legal &amp; General, recommends a thorough overhaul of the UK Financial Reporting Council, to give it sharper teeth in regulating the financial conduct of companies.</p><p>If these recommendations are carried out - as appears likely - the auditing industry could be in for a complete restructuring, not just in the UK but globally. The Big Four say they are not averse to change, though that may reflect the fact that it is inevitable rather than an enthusiastic embrace of reform.</p><p>The auditing industry may be an extreme example of corporate \"gigantism\". This is a tendency that leads to abusive behaviour and a lack of boardroom accountability, stifles innovation, and runs counter to the spirit of capitalism. I can think of three other industries that display elements of anti-competitive and oligopolistic behaviour.</p><p>One is banking. The root cause of the financial crisis of 2008 was that banks had become too big and concentrated. This was true of both high street banks and investment banks. In the latter case, the crisis led to the collapse of at least two fabled Wall Street names - Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Others have seen their investment banking business wither in the past decade, Deutsche Bank being perhaps the most notable example. To all intents and purposes, there are now only three investment banks with global heft: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan.</p><p>At the same time, commercial banks are once again becoming concentrated. Competition appears to have vanished from the Irish banking market, if the controversy over mortgage interest rates, much higher here than elsewhere in the eurozone, is a guide. The European commercial banking market is concentrated in a shrinking pool of banks: HSBC, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UniCredit and a handful of others. It is almost impossible to become a successful start-up bank, as the stuttering attempts of the UK's \"challenger\" banks to take on high street incumbents shows.</p><p>Another industry stifled by concentration is pharmaceuticals, dominated by a small number of very big firms: Glaxosmithkline, Pfizer, Merck, Roche and a few others. These companies used to be inventors of new drugs. Now, the emphasis on research and development is giving way to the tendency to buy new products from research-driven start-ups in the fields of biotech and \"organic\" medicines. There is still plenty of innovation in the industry, just not in Big Pharma.</p><p>The third example of gigantism is perhaps the most glaring: Big Tech. Silicon Valley has developed what appears to be a sense of entitlement to gigantism. This year, Apple became for a time the first American company to be valued on the stock market at a trillion dollars.</p><p>At least Apple has a degree of competition, from the likes of Samsung. That is not the case for Google and Facebook, which completely dominate the social media environment, and Amazon, the tech-retail giant that is disrupting the retail industry. Facebook has achieved this by scooping up potential competitors to its dominance of social media, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Moreover, the emergence of the Silicon Valley giants has led to another unhealthy phenomenon - the concentration of stock market investment in the so-called FAANGs, the five tech companies that dominate the industry.</p><p>There was once a US tradition of trust-busting - breaking up huge companies to break monopolies. Those rules are still around, but the will to enforce them shrivelled as US politics was captured by corporate lobbying. Without an American lead, monopolies tend to flourish. The European Union talks, and sometimes acts, like a trust-buster. If the UK gets its way with the Big Four, this essential capitalist practice could be about to make a comeback.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-50228708</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0V-96C1-JCJY-G3KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 20, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The auditing industry, supposedly the most staid of professions, may be on the brink of a revolution. Or rather, if proposals that emerged this week from two reviews of the sector are implemented, it is about to be cut down to size, perhaps literally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global auditing business is dominated by four companies, PWC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte. This is not a new phenomenon: the industry has been consolidating for decades. Yet it has become increasingly problematic. A series of corporate collapses over the past 20 years, including Enron, Worldcom and Carillion, have been blamed, in part, on failings by their auditors.</p><p>The problem is not that any one auditing company caused any one collapse. It is a more general malaise: that auditors did not spot the dangers, or warn of them, or underestimated or misunderstood the risks embedded in those companies. A corporate collapse is destructive of shareholders, employees and societies. Enron's collapse even led to the fall of its own auditor, Arthur Andersen, in 2002. That turned the Big Five, as it then was, into today's Big Four.</p><p>These four are now so dominant in that, according to the UK Competition and Markets Authority, 97 per cent of large UK companies are audited by one of them. That has led to allegations that they are an oligopoly. Moreover, they have consulting divisions that offer advice on matters such as corporate restructuring and strategy to those same companies, in return for lucrative fees. Critics have long seen that as a conflict of interest.</p><p>Now there are plans to address this undue concentration. The CMA, the UK regulator for competition, consumer protection and mergers and acquisitions, has proposed that consulting be separated from auditing, that the chairs of audit committees on corporate boards be made more accountable, and that a smaller auditing firm work alongside a Big Four member at large companies.</p><p>A separate review by John Kingman, chairman of Legal &amp; General, recommends a thorough overhaul of the UK Financial Reporting Council, to give it sharper teeth in regulating the financial conduct of companies.</p><p>If these recommendations are carried out - as appears likely - the auditing industry could be in for a complete restructuring, not just in the UK but globally. The Big Four say they are not averse to change, though that may reflect the fact that it is inevitable rather than an enthusiastic embrace of reform.</p><p>The auditing industry may be an extreme example of corporate \"gigantism\". This is a tendency that leads to abusive behaviour and a lack of boardroom accountability, stifles innovation, and runs counter to the spirit of capitalism. I can think of three other industries that display elements of anti-competitive and oligopolistic behaviour.</p><p>One is banking. The root cause of the financial crisis of 2008 was that banks had become too big and concentrated. This was true of both high street banks and investment banks. In the latter case, the crisis led to the collapse of at least two fabled Wall Street names - Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Others have seen their investment banking business wither in the past decade, Deutsche Bank being perhaps the most notable example. To all intents and purposes, there are now only three investment banks with global heft: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan.</p><p>At the same time, commercial banks are once again becoming concentrated. Competition appears to have vanished from the Irish banking market, if the controversy over mortgage interest rates, much higher here than elsewhere in the eurozone, is a guide. The European commercial banking market is concentrated in a shrinking pool of banks: HSBC, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UniCredit and a handful of others. It is almost impossible to become a successful start-up bank, as the stuttering attempts of the UK's \"challenger\" banks to take on high street incumbents shows.</p><p>Another industry stifled by concentration is pharmaceuticals, dominated by a small number of very big firms: Glaxosmithkline, Pfizer, Merck, Roche and a few others. These companies used to be inventors of new drugs. Now, the emphasis on research and development is giving way to the tendency to buy new products from research-driven start-ups in the fields of biotech and \"organic\" medicines. There is still plenty of innovation in the industry, just not in Big Pharma.</p><p>The third example of gigantism is perhaps the most glaring: Big Tech. Silicon Valley has developed what appears to be a sense of entitlement to gigantism. This year, Apple became for a time the first American company to be valued on the stock market at a trillion dollars.</p><p>At least Apple has a degree of competition, from the likes of Samsung. That is not the case for Google and Facebook, which completely dominate the social media environment, and Amazon, the tech-retail giant that is disrupting the retail industry. Facebook has achieved this by scooping up potential competitors to its dominance of social media, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Moreover, the emergence of the Silicon Valley giants has led to another unhealthy phenomenon - the concentration of stock market investment in the so-called FAANGs, the five tech companies that dominate the industry.</p><p>There was once a US tradition of trust-busting - breaking up huge companies to break monopolies. Those rules are still around, but the will to enforce them shrivelled as US politics was captured by corporate lobbying. Without an American lead, monopolies tend to flourish. The European Union talks, and sometimes acts, like a trustbuster. If the UK gets its way with the Big Four, this essential capitalist practice could be about to make a comeback.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:vincent.boland@gmail.com\">vincent.boland@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-144775710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0W-2M81-JCBW-N3BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 20, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001O29</classCode><className>ENRON CREDITORS RECOVERY CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

And Amazon's stock was sagging as the president of the United States regularly attacked the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Just as it appeared that the big tech companies' endless upward march had finally come to an end, they led a remarkable rally. </p><p>  This year, the S&amp;P 500 tech sector is up more than 40 percent, handily outpacing the 25 percent gain for the benchmark index over all, which is itself the third-best annual return of the past two decades. </p><p>Apple stock is up 70 percent, and it set a high-water mark last week. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is up 28.5 percent, and set its own record on Monday. Microsoft shares have soared 49 percent in 2019, and Amazon is up 16 percent. </p><p>  And Facebook -- whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has spent much of the past two years telling lawmakers why his company can be trusted on issues as varied as personal data and cryptocurrency -- is up 53 percent.</p><p>  Tech has surged in part thanks to the tide of rate cuts unleashed by the Federal Reserve, which has lifted all boats. The gains also reflect the relief investors are feeling that the trade war's worst outcomes haven't come to pass. </p><p>  The trade-sensitive chip maker AMD more than doubled on such a swing in sentiment, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year. Lam Research, which produces semiconductor manufacturing equipment, is up more than 90 percent, the second-best showing. </p><p>  But the giants of technology -- companies like Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft -- are the stocks that have made the market's year. Their bulk gives them outsize sway over indexes like the S&amp;P 500, which are weighted by market capitalization. In other words, price moves of bigger companies move the index the most. </p><p>  The rise in value of these five companies alone accounted for more than 20 percent of the total returns of the S&amp;P 500 this year, through the end of November. </p><p>  ''It's been a great year for mega-cap tech for sure,'' said Richard Bodzy, a portfolio manager at Putnam Investments whose top two holdings are Microsoft and Apple. </p><p>  Few would have predicted such robust results a year ago.</p><p>  Between October 2018 and January, Apple's share price crashed roughly 40 percent. The stock plummeted nearly 10 percent in a single day -- Jan. 3 -- after the company cut its outlook for sales for the first time in over a decade, citing slowing iPhone sales in China. </p><p>Facebook's stock dropped 43 percent from its 2018 peak to the market's trough last December, as it faced months of scrutiny related to the use of its platform by Russians seeking to influence the 2016 American presidential campaign as well as the collection of users' data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The tumble included a 19 percent nose dive -- the company's worst day ever -- on July 26, after executives said future profits would be hurt as it ramped up spending on security. </p><p>Amazon shares lost roughly 34 percent of their value between September 2018 and Christmas. President Trump has assailed the company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. Mr. Trump publicly accused Amazon of avoiding taxes and called The Post, which has aggressively covered the Trump administration, a lobbyist for the company. On Monday, Amazon said Mr. Trump had pressured the Pentagon to cut it out of a multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract.</p><p>  With a slump of roughly 19 percent, Microsoft stood out for its relative resilience. Some investors dumped their shares late last year as the company's juggernaut web services division experienced a temporary deceleration in sales growth. </p><p>  But, just when things looked bleakest, stocks began to rise. </p><p>  In January, the Federal Reserve swiveled away from its 2018 policy of raising rates, toward its eventual decision to chop them three times in 2019. The Fed's efforts buoyed shares broadly, helping to set off the best start for the S&amp;P 500 since the late 1980s. </p><p>  The Fed chose to cut rates, in part, because of rising threats to economic growth. Those concerns also drove investors to buy shares in mega-cap tech companies. </p><p>  ''They are more economically resilient,'' said Jeb Breece, principal at Spears Abacus, an independent money management firm in Manhattan. ''A dollar of tech earnings seems like more of a sure bet than a dollar of Midwestern steel earnings.''</p><p>  And earnings among the tech giants have held up better than some had feared. After ugly results in the first and second quarters, Facebook's third quarter topped expectations for profit and revenue. </p><p>Apple's results have also been better than expected recently, and Microsoft in particular has notched supercharged results. Its Azure cloud computing business has helped push the company's profit growth rate up to almost 30 percent for the last three quarters. </p><p>  That has driven Apple and Microsoft -- which also happen to be the largest companies in the United States, by market cap -- to their best performances in a decade. </p><p>  The recent climbs have left these tech giants with some of the largest market values on earth. Apple and Microsoft both have a market value of over $1 trillion. Alphabet is worth more than $900 billion.</p><p>  The sheer scale of these companies is part of what makes their rise this year so remarkable. While huge share price surges are common in the market for smaller capitalization companies, these are giants. </p><p>  The law of large numbers means it is far more difficult to generate large percentage increases in value. A unique confluence of factors allowed these companies to break that law this year. But observers say it's unlikely they will regularly clock such large gains. </p><p>  ''How does Microsoft double again? You're adding a trillion dollars,'' Mr. Breece said. ''You're just getting to huge numbers.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Amazon's stock is up more than 16 percent this year, and relative to its tech peers, that rise is modest.

We've got this incredibly important issue from Foreign Affairs. We'll get to that with Gideon Rose here a bit, but all of that is pushed aside by the President's comments in the last 24 hours on Fed independence.  </p><p>      We are thrilled to bring you this morning John Ryding of RDQ Economics. He is truly an expert on the Fed with his public service to the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System.  </p><p>      John, how independent is the Federal Reserve this morning?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  eight says independent it was yesterday or last year or four or five years ago. In a similar way to the Supreme Court, obviously the President can influence the Fed by his nominations. And his nominations to the board have been strong.  </p><p>      Richard Clarida who you know very well is just an excellent choice for the Fed vice chair and I think his confirmation, you know, will go thread fairly soon.  </p><p>      So, we all know the President and his tendency to tweet one something or speak about something or complain about something. And maybe that's just because -- it's just the second time he's done this. It's not the normal protocol, but I don't think it influences Fed policy. But anything, the Fed may be more inclined to take a marginal action to raise rates.  </p><p>      And I don't think the decision to raise rates this year in September, December, you know, or even close decision. So I think two more rate hikes and we'll see by December the Fed policy was influenced.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  The team around him, David Malpass who you worked with for years at Bear Sterns. Mr. Kudlow and others, Secretary Mnuchin, did they have a voice to staunch the President's intentions whether someone politically sees them as good or bad?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, they obviously have a voice. But, you know, we do have a President who at times can lash out or say things and there are also competing voices and obviously, you know, the biggest area of that is in the trade area where you've got, you know, Peter Navarro on one side of very protectionist trade agenda and Larry Kudlow with, you know, remains a free market guy. But he knows there a lot of, you know, China in particular being not a good actor on foreign policy --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right, John?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  -- tariffs and free trade, you know, the President's taking actions against that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right. And John, for the moment, the President and his administration think that they're winning the trade war. Will China make them pay for it? Will they make them pay for it next to or closer to the midterm elections? And what would that do to big block buster U.S. companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, Francine, nobody wins in a trade war. I think, you know, one of the almost universe if (ph) we propositions amongst most economists are the, you know, trade war's tariffs, they are welfare reducing on all sides.  </p><p>      So, it's not that I think that President Trump is a protectionist, it's that he thinks that tariffs because China has much larger exports to the U.S versus U.S. exports to China has more to lose. And therefore, by taking action and bringing them to the table and try and make progress in the same way that we had the start of a dialogue with the E.U.  </p><p>      So, I think if isn't trade war, it's not just the U.S. that pays. It's China that pays and we have to see how this plays out. I can't say I'm comfortable with it, but it's not that, you know, China can unilaterally damage the U.S. It would damage itself in the process.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right, Gideon, do you think the U.S. cares?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, I go with everything John just said, except the President not being a protectionist. And from -- as a social scientist, what I find absolutely fascinating about the situation is I cannot remember a previous era in which we all sat around trying to predict what the government of the United States would do when the President of the United States, is it war with his own administration.  </p><p>      So we have no real models are precedent for understanding what happens when the government administration, the deep state, everything goes on and does its basic stuff as John was just talking about, the professional technocrats do their stuff, but then the guy at the top of the whole system who supposedly running things for the benefit of the country and the world and in sequence coordinating all the stuff goes off on a completely separate path and undermines his own administration actions.  </p><p>      Whether it's in the justice department, or whether it's in the economic policy department or whether it's in the security department. And so, we actually end up doing what John just said which is discounting the President's words, but then trying to figure what actually is going to be U.S. policy. So, we don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right, I'll just tell you on this book here in a bit on the World War Web with Gideon Rose. It may be the issue ever for them. But right here, I'm going to hold this up, the unrestrained presidency within Gideon Rose's new effort. And within that on IR, but it can be on John's economics as well, the unconstrained presidencies because the legislatures is given up. Where is the legislature to push back against this debate on Fed independence?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Well, so --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Still nowhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, essentially, everything in U.S. politics has become subject to a partisan lens, right. You have Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans have aligned themselves at this point completely with the President who's is the head of their party of the leader office, and essentially now there is no Republican Party except on something, it's essentially Trump. And what Trump -- but he can't do anything.  </p><p>      So the question is, where does the President focus his attention in his discretionary powers? And then what happens with the rest of the government when they're doing the Donald Reagan cleaning up after the elephant phase? How does that all play out and what is the net result? We don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Lots tot talk about here with John Riding and Gideon Rose. This is an important segment on the World War Web here in a bit.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  John Ryding with us of RDQ Economics. John, how many times has the Fed raised rates? Help the President here. You mentioned two rates earlier, but how many times do they raise rates through 2019? Were there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  I think another four times in 2019. I mean --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Two plus four equals six.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, yes, two in 2000 and the rest of 2018 and four next year. I mean, look behind, you've got a charts on the real Fed funds rate if I'm looking at your wall correctly. And that's still negative which means to say that the inflation rate's still higher than the short-term interest rate. And that's normally consistent with accommodated conditions.  </p><p>      The equity market is within half a percent of record high. I don't see where we've had any tightening, reduced accommodation by the Fed with the rate hike so far.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You have been the leading voice in market economics on the idea that higher rates is a good signal for this American economy. Can you say that right now with the debt that's coming on, the deficits that's coming on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Look, absolutely. I mean, you know, on the one hand and you had guest in your previous how you were talking about the yield curve and the flattening of the yield curve. You know, long term interest rates still remain very low. And monetary policy isn't about conducting interest rate policy to keep the cost of servicing the debt down.  </p><p>      Monetary policy is about maintaining stable prices and full employment as the Fed's mandated to and it's actually doing a pretty good job of doing that. But long-term, if inflations were to get out of hand and long term interest rates were to go up, that would be a lot more damaging for funding costs from the U.S. debt than the Fed rate hikes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  John, do you worry about where the U.S. economy is in, you know, the cycle effect, that late cycle and that there's a huge divergence with what, you know, BOJ are doing, ECB is doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, in terms of where we are in the cycle, I was a lot more worried in 2016. In 2016, we're seeing a macroeconomic profit squeeze in the U.S. of the kind of magnitude that signaled a potential recession problem ahead. That's a far more important signal to me than the yield curve.  </p><p>      We had the corporate tax sculptures (ph) and reforms are absolutely essential for reinvigorating corporate America. And now we've seen pre-text macro-profit margins widen.  </p><p>      Now, that may be a problem down the road with inflation. And productivity of growth rates are too low, but in some ways with the way the stock markets moving, with the way it looks like corporate profits are shaping up in the second quarter, it may be that we had a growth recession in 2015, 2016 and we may be coming out of that with stronger growth. The problem is how much slack this was we saw the life in the labor market at a 3.9 percent unemployment rate?  </p><p>      But so I've been surprised at how many people we have drawn in. And now, it does seem that the U.S. economy is bring in people, more marginal people in terms of education and so on into labor force for a while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  John Ryding with us who will return in the next half hour on the Central Bank.  </p><p>      Coming up, Gideon Rose will talk about the Web, look later today on Bloomberg Surveillance on Tesla, on governance. John Coffee, Professor Coffee of course with Columbia. This is Bloomberg, stay with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Let's get back to Gideon Rose of Foreign Affairs and John Ryding of RDQ Economics. John, when you look at China, I just don't believe there's not a slow down. I guess the question is how the authorities deal with it. It's by stimulating the economy so they stabilize it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, the angst say slow down from what rates. So China has been growing 6.5, seven percent at least in their efficient numbers. And if you project that out on compound growth rates and that kind of growth rate cannot be sustainable over a multi-decade period. The China has to slow eventually to the more normal global growth rate as China runs out of the ability to move population from the agricultural sector into the industrial sector.  </p><p>      So, I think we get too hung up on what China is growing at 6.7 percent or 6.5 percent or, you know, the reality is what China needs to reorientate scope (ph) economy away from being a primarily investment economy to more of a consumer economy. And that might end up being a healthier growth rate and development for the global economy then China simply growing at a faster pace with undertaking a lot of directed investments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Gideon, how would you view Chinese politics right now and how bad it actually impacts the economy? If you can you hear me? Can you hear me?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  All right, a second, I can't hear you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  No, no one can hear me. Tom, translate for me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, we've got some audio problems going on right now. I mean, I look into the China and I look the -- well, we've got some on (ph) and we'll talk to Francine I guess is what we're going to do here across the transatlantic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Can you hear me?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Yes, I can hear you now Francine, sorry about that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK, I'm also hearing myself in Dolby stereo. Gideon, I was asking about Chinese politics and how Chinese politics actually influences the economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, it's actually a great question because what the Chinese actually understand I think far better than their Anglo-American counterparts is that the growth rates and the economic dynamism of the society and the progress toward on economic matters is situated within a political and social context. And so, what the Chinese government is trying to do is not just manage its growth rate and its economic policy, but also manage the entire polity of China in order to preserve the leadership of Xi Jinping and preserve stability within China and increase Chinese power.  </p><p>      And that broader context is actually really important because that's the kind of attention, not just to economic policy alone, but to the broader context of economics, society, and politics that economic policy makers in the west have basically intended to lose sight of which is producing a system in which there's a lot of push back and turmoil and people are getting that response (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We're going to have to leave it there. We'll get our audio straighten now and we thank you for being with us. With John Riding and Gideon Rose, please stay with us, this is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  With us is Gideon Rose, he is of course the Editor in Chief of Foreign Affairs. Gideon, congratulations on this. Let me get right to it. The internet has lost its promise. Discuss.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, thank you very much for your kind words about the issue. Basically, think of this as a four at play. In the first act, the United States government creates the fundamentals of what we'll now call the internet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  The communication's network and a bunch of corporate (ph) of stuff --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  In act two, the United States government pairs with and partners with the private sector to develop this. It makes the infrastructure generally public and then allows private sector actors to develop all sorts of applications and so forth. This is the golden age of the internet in 1990's and things like that.  </p><p>      Act three, this starts to fray because the system goes on autopilot. And what happens is the large private tech companies take over large portions of the internet and become a sort of oligopoly running things on their own, government regulators really don't really get involved and the interne takes on its own life.  </p><p>      And during chapter three, the act three, various people start to push back against the problems with the internet. The Chinese try to succeed in a cyber sovereignty in their own sphere. The Europeans try to do regulations with GDPR. The Indians try to build a new internet from the ground up on more populist public good basis. And the Americans sit around wondering, can we control the tech companies? But Americans are so embedded in an Anglo-American view of liberal capitalism in which the government lets the private sector do its stuff that American policy has allowed the internet to create problems and now other people are stepping in to fix those problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You really explained, then who has the power here? As you go chapter by chapter brilliantly, is it shining with the power or is it European regulatory structure that has --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So the great question is we don't know who's going to have the power in act four. Because what happened in act one and two was the U.S. government created the infrastructure and turned it over to the private sector to help run. And in act three, we end up getting a lot of push back. And right now, you have governments like China, you have regional regulators like those in Europe, you have private sector companies like big tech, you have the citizens in general and nobody knows who is going to control the commanding heights of the digital economy.  </p><p>      Like for example, data regulation, who is going to get to keep and control and monetize the data? The individuals? The companies? The governments?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, but this is (INAUDIBLE). You mentioned commanding heights which is of course Daniel Yergin in his classic book on the 90s on the 20th century. Capitalism, there were two wars in the middle of Dan Yergin's commanding heights. What's going to be the warfare equivalent of this technology in our society?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, it's not going to be warfare in terms of geopolitical conflict between the major powers. What's going to happen is there was a common American sponsored liberal open order of the internet. Somewhat parallel to the globalization order and American officials move that forward to get all the benefits, but they forgot that the destruction part of created destruction creates pushback and people resist. And what you're seeing now in China, in Europe, in India even in the U.S. is people reacting against an unfettered private sector dominated internet but no one knows how to reestablish control because you don't want kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs.  </p><p>      So, what's happening right now is the question over the future control of the internet. It's not necessarily just going to be what it was in the last couple of decades which is, the United States debating whether or not to allow tech companies to have control over things.  </p><p>      Now, other global players are in fact going to be an important to this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Then how do you respond to the news just in the last 24 hours Apple limit x number of apps to China. I mean with their new chapter on China, they're making the rules, we're not. And even Tim Cook, Chief Operating officer of Tesla down Tim Cook has to vow to China.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So what I feel about this is it's a little bit like the economic nationalism in other areas that we're seeing, right. Globalization races forward, it produces lots of wonderful things, lots of creative destruction and turmoil, but it also produces pushback and problems for people inside major developed western countries which causes them to want to put breaks in the process.  </p><p>      Take -- the fact is the Chinese are doing the same thing with the internet and just like American economic nationalist and populists and British wants and up places elsewhere want to hide off their economies from the globe and establish sovereignty, so the Chinese are trying to do the same thing for the internet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right, but we're talking about the different things, right. Gideon, on the one side, it's like cybersecurity and I guess, you know, the cyber race on who will have supremacy between China and the U.S. The other one is simply who is in the third act. It could be regulators, right. And this is Europe. Europe is leading a forefront regulation on automated (ph) passes pushback against it, but when it comes to data protection, these are the new people in town.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Yes, but it's actually there are several competitors trying to do the same thing and we don't know which way of controlling the problems is going to win out. The European approach is regulation for the whole system, OK. The Chinese approaches secession from the system. Cyber sovereignty eventually the goal of that is to create essentially a splinternet in which there's a general public internet but the Chinese have build their own platforms, their own systems in 20 years in effect it'll be much more of a Chinese dominated internet than American dominated one.  </p><p>      The Indians want to reengineer the whole thing from the ground up. Fascinating article by Nandan Nilekani from emphasis abut what the Indians are doing in internet policy, maybe the most impressive and interesting of all the different approaches even though we don't hear much about it. And basically United States we're still wondering what to do because we don't basically have the conceptual ability to direct companies the way the government wants. And so, for the public ones.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK. Talk to me about regulation because there's a great article in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs written by Helen Dixon saying regulate to liberate, can Europe save the internet? Can it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Well, so this is the great question. We tried to present a fair picture of this whole big debate. It's going forward on the future. So the lead piece in the package is by Adam Siegel talking about the transition of power from United States to China. Helen Dixon's article expresses the European approach which is no, it doesn't have to be the U.S. approach or the Chinese separate one, we can regulate it. Nandan Nilekani talks about the Indian one. We also have a number of different pieces on specific challenges of cyber security.  </p><p>      You should look at the European approach, the Chinese approach, the Indian approach and the American approach as variance of the same thing. Now that we've unleashed the wonderful creative destruction of digital technology, how do we keep it going forward in a positive way while controlling the social and political effects of all of this creative destruction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Would these nations ever come together, Gideon? I don't know if whether it's a plaza accord for the internet. But, you know, that's the kind of idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, if people like John Ryding were controlling this stuff, then the answer would be yes because there's an obvious benefit for people to come together in a collective action coordination solution to read the benefits of a coordinated policy with central regulation.  </p><p>      But the problem is right now we have a tied international politics in the United States and elsewhere which is going inward rather than collective and I think the answer is we're moving towards a splinternet more than we are towards a new revelation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I love -- can we steal that words splinternet you get a royalty on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  It's not mine but it's a favorite --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Here's the New York Times today folks, I'll read it for you. Russian hackers broaden the tax to consumers. First of all, I've got to make some news here with the counsel and foreign relations hack by Russians as well in this article?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Like everybody else, we're constantly fished and attacked by various different actors. But that's just -- the Russians don't bother me as much. The Russians are like Butch Cassidy on the Sundance kid harassing the railroad.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK, who's the Katherine Losse (ph) of the World War Web? That's a Butch Cassidy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  If the Chinese were going to be building a whole new railroad. So, we're worrying like E.H. Harriman in the Union percent (ph) of railroad about who's stealing our little -- we're worrying about who's stealing our safe. The Chinese are going around buying up the land and wanting them changed and developing engine technology 20 years from now, we're going to be running on Chinese trains and we're going to be wondering how did that happened.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK, then what is -- Francine's wonderful question about how do we get together on this, where is the unifying force particularly given the fractious politics our president's having with our allies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Karen Lornbluh and Michele Flournoy and Michael Somare have pieces in the article, in the package telling you what the United States should do and there are a lot of things.  </p><p>      Again, I would look to the Indian approach of the internet as a public good that may hold the best solution down the long road.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, but Tim Cook's stock options is not the public good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  The question of the regulation of capitalism in a way that is beneficial economically, but also sustainable politically and socially is going to be that question of the mid 21st century.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Gideon, do you think any of these companies would self regulate for real?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Yes, just like Martin Shkreli will self regulate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It's respectively look?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Yes, we can count on the tech companies to self regulate just like we can count on the pharmaceutical companies to provide low-cost medicines for everybody without regard to jacking up things when they have a cash monopoly like it ever been (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, perfect. So, we do a little bit of, you know, that's a no. But why not? If you listen to the rationale of them regulating, it's either you regulate or you don't survive as people stop using you because you don't, you know, they don't trust. This -- they make money out of trusts, they don't make money out of selling drugs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Yes, in the long run. And in the short run, you make money by increasing your share of things, right. We have a president right now who is ignoring the entire cost of a global trade war to get some short term minor advantage in trivial little issues.  </p><p>      So, that kind of thinking if it can apply to the president of United States and the entire Republican Party, it also applies to individual private sector company managers. So we can't rely on them to be responsible for the entire global community down the road.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Gideon, thank you so much. Your most important issue, I really mean this folks how dumb I am on our World War Web and I've to read it cover to cover. I can't say enough about it.  </p><p>      We're going to come back. John Ryding of RDQ Economics to dive once more into the independence of your selected central bank and then an important conversation with Gerard Cassidy on Fortress diamond, Fortress Moynihan in your neighborhood bank.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  John Ryding with us with RDQ Economics and Gerard Cassidy joins from RBC Capital Markets and both of them have leaved every moment of this crisis. John, let me start with you as you go back and you look at where we are, can you say we're out of the crisis and it's a distant memory?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  We're out of the crisis and unfortunately it's a distant memory because by -- it become a distant memory, it's the way that some of the mistakes we make. But the difference between now and then is the degree of bank capital.  </p><p>      I think the system is much better buffered ad that's a positive. I think the unfortunate thing is in the re-regulation phase, some of the powers of the Fed intervened have been diminished sort of length of last resort which in the end is key when we get enterprises those -- some of those length of last resort facilities that powers been clipped.  </p><p>      But, yes, it's 10 years on, banks are well capitalized and this is when we make the mistakes that sow the seeds for the next problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And Former Fed Official and Economist John Ryder, now we go to the trenches of securities analysis here. Do you agree that our banks are stronger and more resilient to the surprises that can come from 2006 and on to 2007?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  Absolutely Tom, what we've seen the banking industry has been recapitalized quite romantically. We haven't seen levels of capital like this in decades.  </p><p>      I would also point out what the Federal Reserve did though was they pushed the risk outside the commercial banking system. It is now in the shadow of banking industry. That's where the risk lies.  </p><p>      So when the next crisis comes, we're not going to JPMorgan or Bank of America or Citigroup have the problems that they had last time. But I do worry about the hedge funds, the mutual funds, all the other outside, the traditional-commercial banking industry, those are the folks that could have the real problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  John, where do you think the next crisis will come from? Is it going to be from Asia, is it going to be away from the financial sector?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYDING</emphasis>:  Well, I think in all things, the source of the crisis suppose to what the crisis is becomes financial policy, monetary policy that's too lose. I still think we have lax monetary policy that leads to over leverage, that leads to capital flow into asset classes that it shouldn't be.  </p><p>      But the system is being tested. What's happening in Turkey and the global ramifications, that's an interesting test because we thought emerging markets is one area that's going to be overleveraged. But, I don't see that so much as a systemic issue in the same way that (INAUDIBLE) turned out to be systemic issue back in 2010.  </p><p>      So, capital is an important buffer to hold back those crises. But raising interest rates is the best way to avoid getting into it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  It's exceptionally time with John Ryding, thank you so much for being with us today. John Ryding on Fed independence, he's with RDQ economics. Coming up, a really important chart with Gerard Cassidy, we'll that next. This is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  It's just a simple chart with Gerard Cassidy to look at here. And Gerard, what I want to talk about, forget about the Bull market like Fortress Diamond and maybe back here is a Harris and like here's a great malaise. How does any bank institution avoid a 15 year churn? What do you do to avoid that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  Tom, I think that this is a phenomenal chart to have a go back as far as you have it and you do show the two great up legs. But there is that period that you point out this malaise. I think what it is, today, the banks are more focused than ever on shareholder return. During that malaise period, it was the recovery coming out of the 1990 downturn, but then you had the tech implosion in 2001. So those two periods affected the malaise that you identified.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Who into -- your universe and even bank on the cover, I understand the game. Who is the one that uses technology best? Who's the technological leader in the Cassidy world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  I would say that you have to identify probably our top banks, including bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Citigroup I would put in there as well. So, our biggest banks are not only spending the most money, they are also becoming the most tech savvy. They're embracing it. They know the digitalization of banking is the future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Gerard, are there concerns that actually some like Facebook or Amazon or someone else will go into banking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  I would say that we don't really have to worry about that at this time. And the reason being there was a large moat around commercial banking. If you want to take the deposits and make loans, you have to have a banking license. I'm not -- I don't believe that Facebook, Google, or any of these companies want to become a bank holding company because you will be regulated by the bank regulators which would then lead to a much lower stock multiple. So right now, the moat is very difficult if impossible to cross.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  We love talking about banks. We talk about capital ratios, we talk about you know, the thick (ph) and all of that, but actually who's the bank that's talking to millenials and is that the next frontier?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  You know, it's interesting because the millenials are a very important part of the banking system and all the banks are trying to reach out with to them.  </p><p>      I was with U.S. bank core yesterday in Boston and it was very clear to me that this company is reaching out and through their payment system, to millennials because think of Venmo or Uber, that's the first introduction many of these millenials have to the banking system is through payments where many of us, Tom and I and folks first time we ever got in touch with the bank was with the passbook savings account. That's not the way in many of millenials do it anymore.  </p><p>      So, I would say the big banks JPMorgan and Bank of America, Regional Banks like PMC and U.S. bank are doing very good job reaching out to the millenials.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Work very quickly here, when does branch banking finally throw in the towel? tail? I mean you go buy and nobody is them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  Tom, it's amazing what's happening.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  It is amazing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASSIDY</emphasis>:  It truly is. And we have some data to show you that the branch banking peak, the year the Apple introduced the iPhone. So, over the next ten years I would suggest to you but probably there was another third of the branches easily.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  A third, very good. Gerard Cassidy thank you so much and we'll continue this discussion. I'm thrilled to say with Mr. Ferro on Bloomberg Radio here in a moment.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3F-VCW1-F15W-H14B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

This issue is different, it's the most important issue Gideon Rose has ever done, \"World War Web:  The Fight for the Internet's Futures.\"  </p><p>      And, Jon Ferro, I'm so damn on all the stuff. I literally can admit I have to read it cover to cover.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  You and I both, I don't know anything about this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I mean there is a one issue he's ever done where I can I say I will come away from this more informed. Gideon Rose on the internet.  </p><p>      When you put this together, Adam Segal and all the other great writers and real heavy weights here, what was the biggest surprise, the outcome on our world war web?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So, thank you very much for your kind words. I really love this issue too and this package was intellectually exciting to me. And I think the most interesting part of it is that as we put it together, we realized that there were two big stories that in effect the future of the internet was a microcosm of what's come to be known as the Post-American World.  </p><p>      The first big takeaway is that here as elsewhere, there is a transition of power going on between United States and China. But the long-term trend is of internet that started and was dominated by the United States and run according to U.S. principles and liberal, universal openness but that eventually is gradually moving towards either a separate Chinese sphere or a Chinese dominated main sphere in which they run things and you have a Chinese world that the America is living in rather than American world that China is living in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And, Jon, what's so interesting about this chapter to chapter is like every -- you know, it's Ian Bremmer, \"Every Nation for Itself.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR</emphasis>:  So how much influence to the big internet businesses have over the rules of the game?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  Well, this a great question because it turns out that the reason why this power transition is happening is not what you might think. It is not simply a conversion of Chinese power into results, the way it would be in geopolitics or security or elsewhere or simply economics.  </p><p>      What happened is that the United States -- what's happening with the internet is a microcosm of what's happened with globalization more generally. The United States and western elites created a system, essentially a neoliberal system that liberated human potential, created a universal open playing field that allowed things to raise forward and they turned it over to the private sector having created a public infrastructure, they created a private sector competition to build things on top of that.  </p><p>      And that gave us the internet of the 1990s and more recent decades, basically a big open public infrastructure with lots of companies providing various goods and services for people and platforms to do it.  </p><p>      But that went on autopilot and those companies ended up becoming an oligopoly. And now the major experience of being online is mediated and infiltrated by those few big tech companies. And what turned out is that many people don't necessarily like that. And elsewhere in the Anglo-American world, elsewhere, I said the Anglo-American world, people have no qualms about controlling things.  </p><p>      And so the Europeans with GDPR are reasserting if they control. The Indians are trying to build a new internet from the ground up. And the Chinese are trying to stress cyber sovereignty. All of these are different approaches to reasserting political control over an unchecked real liberal internet going forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let me translate it to get to the, you know, the end of 200 pages of your magazine which is we're all a lot smarter now than we were 8, 9, 10, 12 years ago. Where are going to be in five years on this? Can you and your experts envision where the United States, where China, and as you mentioned repeatedly, where India will be on the internet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSE</emphasis>:  So the question here is hard to predict because right now there is a fight for the control over the basic rules of a game in cyberspace and digital stuff going online in the world going forward. Who will control things? Will it be governments like the Chinese government?  </p><p>      The Chinese version of cyber sovereignty is sort of like economic nationalism applied for the internet. They want their sphere to be controlled by the Chinese government by Beijing and they have no qualms or problems saying everybody else grew (ph) out. We don't care about the investors of the world. We don't care about private companies. We don't care about our people. We the Chinese government are going to control things.  </p><p>      Europe takes a different approach. They want to regulate the entire word, keep it a single system but have good strong regulation to make things OK. The Indians want something different and the Americans basically know there are problems but we don't have anything in place in United States for controlling tech companies. So right now, we just called them into Congress and drove on them while the problems continue to (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, this is going fabulous, Foreign Affairs \"Word War Web,\" Adam Segal leads it off. Francine Lacqua loved Helen Dixon's article on Europe and regulation. If you have anything to do with technology, this is the must read into September, Foreign Affairs' \"World War Web.\" I'll flag it to death out on social here as we can.  </p><p>      Gideon Rose with the Council on Foreign Relations and, of course, Foreign Affairs Magazine.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3F-VCW1-F15W-H14V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">35 minutes</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  This is a wonderful hour, Gerard Cassidy to  join us later on banking.  We've got this incredibly important issue from  Foreign Affairs.  We'll get to that with Gideon Rose here a bit, but all of  that is pushed aside by the President's comments in the last 24 hours on  Fed independence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are thrilled to bring you this morning John Ryding of RDQ Economics.  He  is truly an expert on the Fed with his public service to the Bank of  England and the Federal Reserve System.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, how independent is the Federal Reserve this morning?</p><p>JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ:  eight says independent it was yesterday  or last year or four or five years ago.  In a similar way to the Supreme  Court, obviously the President can influence the Fed by his nominations.   And his nominations to the board have been strong.</p><p>Richard Clarida who you know very well is just an excellent choice for the  Fed vice chair and I think his confirmation, you know, will go thread  fairly soon.</p><p>So, we all know the President and his tendency to tweet one something or  speak about something or complain about something.  And maybe that's just  because -- it's just the second time he's done this.  It's not the normal  protocol, but I don't think it influences Fed policy.  But anything, the  Fed may be more inclined to take a marginal action to raise rates.</p><p>And I don't think the decision to raise rates this year in September,  December, you know, or even close decision.  So I think two more rate hikes  and we'll see by December the Fed policy was influenced.</p><p>KEENE:  The team around him, David Malpass who you worked with for years at  Bear Sterns.  Mr. Kudlow and others, Secretary Mnuchin, did they have a  voice to staunch the President's intentions whether someone politically  sees them as good or bad?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, they obviously have a voice.  But, you know, we do have a  President who at times can lash out or say things and there are also  competing voices and obviously, you know, the biggest area of that is in  the trade area where you've got, you know, Peter Navarro on one side of  very protectionist trade agenda and Larry Kudlow with, you know, remains a  free market guy.  But he knows there a lot of, you know, China in  particular being not a good actor on foreign policy --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Right, John?</p><p>RYDING:  -- tariffs and free trade, you know, the President's taking  actions against that.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  And John, for the moment, the President and his  administration think that they're winning the trade war.  Will China make  them pay for it?  Will they make them pay for it next to or closer to the  midterm elections?  And what would that do to big block buster U.S.  companies?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, Francine, nobody wins in a trade war.  I think, you know,  one of the almost universe if (ph) we propositions amongst most economists  are the, you know, trade war's tariffs, they are welfare reducing on all  sides.</p><p>So, it's not that I think that President Trump is a protectionist, it's  that he thinks that tariffs because China has much larger exports to the  U.S versus U.S. exports to China has more to lose.  And therefore, by  taking action and bringing them to the table and try and make progress in  the same way that we had the start of a dialogue with the E.U.</p><p>So, I think if isn't trade war, it's not just the U.S. that pays.  It's  China that pays and we have to see how this plays out.  I can't say I'm  comfortable with it, but it's not that, you know, China can unilaterally  damage the U.S.  It would damage itself in the process.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, Gideon, do you think the U.S. cares?</p><p>GIDEON ROSE, CHIEF EDITOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  So, I go with everything John  just said, except the President not being a protectionist.  And from -- as  a social scientist, what I find absolutely fascinating about the situation  is I cannot remember a previous era in which we all sat around trying to  predict what the government of the United States would do when the  President of the United States, is it war with his own administration.</p><p>So we have no real models are precedent for understanding what happens when  the government administration, the deep state, everything goes on and does  its basic stuff as John was just talking about, the professional  technocrats do their stuff, but then the guy at the top of the whole system  who supposedly running things for the benefit of the country and the world  and in sequence coordinating all the stuff goes off on a completely  separate path and undermines his own administration actions.</p><p>Whether it's in the justice department, or whether it's in the economic  policy department or whether it's in the security department.  And so, we  actually end up doing what John just said which is discounting the  President's words, but then trying to figure what actually is going to be  U.S. policy.  So, we don't know.</p><p>KEENE:  Right, I'll just tell you on this book here in a bit on the World  War Web with Gideon Rose.  It may be the issue ever for them.  But right  here, I'm going to hold this up, the unrestrained presidency within Gideon  Rose's new effort.  And within that on IR, but it can be on John's  economics as well, the unconstrained presidencies because the legislatures  is given up.  Where is the legislature to push back against this debate on  Fed independence?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so --</p><p>KEENE:  Still nowhere.</p><p>ROSE:  So, essentially, everything in U.S. politics has become subject to a  partisan lens, right.  You have Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans  have aligned themselves at this point completely with the President who's  is the head of their party of the leader office, and essentially now there  is no Republican Party except on something, it's essentially Trump.  And  what Trump -- but he can't do anything.</p><p>So the question is, where does the President focus his attention in his  discretionary powers?  And then what happens with the rest of the  government when they're doing the Donald Reagan cleaning up after the  elephant phase?  How does that all play out and what is the net result?  We  don't know.</p><p>KEENE:  Lots tot talk about here with John Riding and Gideon Rose.  This is  an important segment on the World War Web here in a bit.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us of RDQ Economics.  John, how many times has the  Fed raised rates?  Help the President here.  You mentioned two rates  earlier, but how many times do they raise rates through 2019?  Were there?</p><p>RYDING:  I think another four times in 2019.  I mean --</p><p>KEENE:  Two plus four equals six.</p><p>RYDING:  Well, yes, two in 2000 and the rest of 2018 and four next year.  I  mean, look behind, you've got a charts on the real Fed funds rate if I'm  looking at your wall correctly.  And that's still negative which means to  say that the inflation rate's still higher than the short-term interest  rate.  And that's normally consistent with accommodated conditions.</p><p>The equity market is within half a percent of record high.  I don't see  where we've had any tightening, reduced accommodation by the Fed with the  rate hike so far.</p><p>KEENE:  You have been the leading voice in market economics on the idea  that higher rates is a good signal for this American economy.  Can you say  that right now with the debt that's coming on, the deficits that's coming  on?</p><p>RYDING:  Look, absolutely.  I mean, you know, on the one hand and you had  guest in your previous how you were talking about the yield curve and the  flattening of the yield curve.  You know, long term interest rates still  remain very low.  And monetary policy isn't about conducting interest rate  policy to keep the cost of servicing the debt down.</p><p>Monetary policy is about maintaining stable prices and full employment as  the Fed's mandated to and it's actually doing a pretty good job of doing  that.  But long-term, if inflations were to get out of hand and long term  interest rates were to go up, that would be a lot more damaging for funding  costs from the U.S. debt than the Fed rate hikes.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, do you worry about where the U.S. economy is in, you know,  the cycle effect, that late cycle and that there's a huge divergence with  what, you know, BOJ are doing, ECB is doing?</p><p>RYDING: Well, in terms of where we are in the cycle, I was a lot more  worried in 2016.  In 2016, we're seeing a macroeconomic profit squeeze in  the U.S. of the kind of magnitude that signaled a potential recession  problem ahead.  That's a far more important signal to me than the yield  curve.</p><p>We had the corporate tax sculptures (ph) and reforms are absolutely  essential for reinvigorating corporate America.  And now we've seen pre- text macro-profit margins widen.</p><p>Now, that may be a problem down the road with inflation.  And productivity  of growth rates are too low, but in some ways with the way the stock  markets moving, with the way it looks like corporate profits are shaping up  in the second quarter, it may be that we had a growth recession in 2015,  2016 and we may be coming out of that with stronger growth.  The problem is  how much slack this was we saw the life in the labor market at a 3.9  percent unemployment rate?</p><p>But so I've been surprised at how many people we have drawn in.  And now,  it does seem that the U.S. economy is bring in people, more marginal people  in terms of education and so on into labor force for a while.</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us who will return in the next half hour on the  Central Bank.</p><p>Coming up, Gideon Rose will talk about the Web, look later today on  Bloomberg Surveillance on Tesla, on governance.  John Coffee, Professor  Coffee of course with Columbia.  This is Bloomberg, stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Let's get back to Gideon Rose of Foreign Affairs and John Ryding  of RDQ Economics.  John, when you look at China, I just don't believe  there's not a slow down.  I guess the question is how the authorities deal  with it.  It's by stimulating the economy so they stabilize it.</p><p>RYDING:  Well, the angst say slow down from what rates.  So China has been  growing 6.5, seven percent at least in their efficient numbers.  And if you  project that out on compound growth rates and that kind of growth rate  cannot be sustainable over a multi-decade period.  The China has to slow  eventually to the more normal global growth rate as China runs out of the  ability to move population from the agricultural sector into the industrial  sector.</p><p>So, I think we get too hung up on what China is growing at 6.7 percent or  6.5 percent or, you know, the reality is what China needs to reorientate  scope (ph) economy away from being a primarily investment economy to more  of a consumer economy.  And that might end up being a healthier growth rate  and development for the global economy then China simply growing at a  faster pace with undertaking a lot of directed investments.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gideon, how would you view Chinese politics right now and how bad  it actually impacts the economy?  If you can you hear me?  Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE:  All right, a second, I can't hear you.</p><p>LACQUA:  No, no one can hear me.  Tom, translate for me.</p><p>KEENE:  Well, we've got some audio problems going on right now.  I mean, I  look into the China and I look the -- well, we've got some on (ph) and  we'll talk to Francine I guess is what we're going to do here across the  transatlantic.</p><p>LACQUA:  Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, I can hear you now Francine, sorry about that.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK, I'm also hearing myself in Dolby stereo.  Gideon, I was asking  about Chinese politics and how Chinese politics actually influences the  economy.</p><p>ROSE:  So, it's actually a great question because what the Chinese actually  understand I think far better than their Anglo-American counterparts is  that the growth rates and the economic dynamism of the society and the  progress toward on economic matters is situated within a political and  social context.  And so, what the Chinese government is trying to do is not  just manage its growth rate and its economic policy, but also manage the  entire polity of China in order to preserve the leadership of Xi Jinping  and preserve stability within China and increase Chinese power.</p><p>And that broader context is actually really important because that's the  kind of attention, not just to economic policy alone, but to the broader  context of economics, society, and politics that economic policy makers in  the west have basically intended to lose sight of which is producing a  system in which there's a lot of push back and turmoil and people are  getting that response (ph).</p><p>KEENE:  We're going to have to leave it there.  We'll get our audio  straighten now and we thank you for being with us.  With John Riding and  Gideon Rose, please stay with us, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  With us is Gideon Rose, he is of course the Editor in Chief of  Foreign Affairs.  Gideon, congratulations on this.  Let me get right to it.   The internet has lost its promise.   Discuss.</p><p>ROSE:  So, thank you very much for your kind words about the issue.   Basically, think of this as a four at play.  In the first act, the United  States government creates the fundamentals of what we'll now call the  internet.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>ROSE:  The communication's network and a bunch of corporate (ph) of stuff - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSE:  In act two, the United States government pairs with and partners  with the private sector to develop this.  It makes the infrastructure  generally public and then allows private sector actors to develop all sorts  of applications and so forth.  This is the golden age of the internet in  1990's and things like that.</p><p>Act three, this starts to fray because the system goes on autopilot.  And  what happens is the large private tech companies take over large portions  of the internet and become a sort of oligopoly running things on their own,  government regulators really don't really get involved and the interne  takes on its own life.</p><p>And during chapter three, the act three, various people start to push back  against the problems with the internet.  The Chinese try to succeed in a  cyber sovereignty in their own sphere.  The Europeans try to do regulations  with GDPR.  The Indians try to build a new internet from the ground up on  more populist public good basis.  And the Americans sit around wondering,  can we control the tech companies?  But Americans are so embedded in an  Anglo-American view of liberal capitalism in which the government lets the  private sector do its stuff that American policy has allowed the internet  to create problems and now other people are stepping in to fix those  problems.</p><p>KEENE:  You really explained, then who has the power here?  As you go  chapter by chapter brilliantly, is it shining with the power or is it  European regulatory structure that has --</p><p>ROSE:  So the great question is we don't know who's going to have the power  in act four.  Because what happened in act one and two was the U.S.  government created the infrastructure and turned it over to the private  sector to help run.  And in act three, we end up getting a lot of push  back.  And right now, you have governments like China, you have regional  regulators like those in Europe, you have private sector companies like big  tech, you have the citizens in general and nobody knows who is going to  control the commanding heights of the digital economy.</p><p>Like for example, data regulation, who is going to get to keep and control  and monetize the data?  The individuals?  The companies?  The governments?</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, but this is (INAUDIBLE).  You mentioned commanding heights  which is of course Daniel Yergin in his classic book on the 90s on the 20th  century.  Capitalism, there were two wars in the middle of Dan Yergin's  commanding heights.  What's going to be the warfare equivalent of this  technology in our society?</p><p>ROSE:  So, it's not going to be warfare in terms of geopolitical conflict  between the major powers.  What's going to happen is there was a common  American sponsored liberal open order of the internet.  Somewhat parallel  to the globalization order and American officials move that forward to get  all the benefits, but they forgot that the destruction part of created  destruction creates pushback and people resist.  And what you're seeing now  in China, in Europe, in India even in the U.S. is people reacting against  an unfettered private sector dominated internet but no one knows how to  reestablish control because you don't want kill the goose that's laying the  golden eggs.</p><p>So, what's happening right now is the question over the future control of  the internet.  It's not necessarily just going to be what it was in the  last couple of decades which is, the United States debating whether or not  to allow tech companies to have control over things.</p><p>Now, other global players are in fact going to be an important to this.</p><p>KEENE:  Then how do you respond to the news just in the last 24 hours Apple  limit x number of apps to China.  I mean with their new chapter on China,  they're making the rules, we're not.  And even Tim Cook, Chief Operating  officer of Tesla down Tim Cook has to vow to China.</p><p>ROSE:  So what I feel about this is it's a little bit like the economic  nationalism in other areas that we're seeing, right.  Globalization races  forward, it produces lots of wonderful things, lots of creative destruction  and turmoil, but it also produces pushback and problems for people inside  major developed western countries which causes them to want to put breaks  in the process.</p><p>Take -- the fact is the Chinese are doing the same thing with the internet  and just like American economic nationalist and populists and British wants  and up places elsewhere want to hide off their economies from the globe and  establish sovereignty, so the Chinese are trying to do the same thing for  the internet.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, but we're talking about the different things, right.   Gideon, on the one side, it's like cybersecurity and I guess, you know, the  cyber race on who will have supremacy between China and the U.S.  The other  one is simply who is in the third act.  It could be regulators, right.  And  this is Europe.  Europe is leading a forefront regulation on automated (ph)  passes pushback against it, but when it comes to data protection, these are  the new people in town.</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, but it's actually there are several competitors trying to do  the same thing and we don't know which way of controlling the problems is  going to win out.  The European approach is regulation for the whole  system, OK.  The Chinese approaches secession from the system.  Cyber  sovereignty eventually the goal of that is to create essentially a  splinternet in which there's a general public internet but the Chinese have  build their own platforms, their own systems in 20 years in effect it'll be  much more of a Chinese dominated internet than American dominated one.</p><p>The Indians want to reengineer the whole thing from the ground up.   Fascinating article by Nandan Nilekani from emphasis abut what the Indians  are doing in internet policy, maybe the most impressive and interesting of  all the different approaches even though we don't hear much about it.  And  basically United States we're still wondering what to do because we don't  basically have the conceptual ability to direct companies the way the  government wants.  And so, for the public ones.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Talk to me about regulation because there's a great article  in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs written by Helen Dixon saying  regulate to liberate, can Europe save the internet?  Can it?</p><p>ROSE:  Well, so this is the great question.  We tried to present a fair  picture of this whole big debate.  It's going forward on the future.  So  the lead piece in the package is by Adam Siegel talking about the  transition of power from United States to China.  Helen Dixon's article  expresses the European approach which is no, it doesn't have to be the U.S.  approach or the Chinese separate one, we can regulate it.  Nandan Nilekani  talks about the Indian one.  We also have a number of different pieces on  specific challenges of cyber security.</p><p>You should look at the European approach, the Chinese approach, the Indian  approach and the American approach as variance of the same thing.  Now that  we've unleashed the wonderful creative destruction of digital technology,  how do we keep it going forward in a positive way while controlling the  social and political effects of all of this creative destruction?</p><p>LACQUA:  Would these nations ever come together, Gideon?  I don't know if  whether it's a plaza accord for the internet.  But, you know, that's the  kind of idea.</p><p>ROSE:  So, if people like John Ryding were controlling this stuff, then the  answer would be yes because there's an obvious benefit for people to come  together in a collective action coordination solution to read the benefits  of a coordinated policy with central regulation.</p><p>But the problem is right now we have a tied international politics in the  United States and elsewhere which is going inward rather than collective  and I think the answer is we're moving towards a splinternet more than we  are towards a new revelation.</p><p>KEENE:  I love -- can we steal that words splinternet you get a royalty on  that.</p><p>ROSE:  It's not mine but it's a favorite --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Here's the New York Times today folks, I'll read it for you.   Russian hackers broaden the tax to consumers.  First of all, I've got to  make some news here with the counsel and foreign relations hack by Russians  as well in this article?</p><p>ROSE:  Like everybody else, we're constantly fished and attacked by various  different actors.  But that's just -- the Russians don't bother me as much.   The Russians are like Butch Cassidy on the Sundance kid harassing the  railroad.</p><p>KEENE:  OK, who's the Katherine Losse (ph) of the World War Web?  That's a  Butch Cassidy.</p><p>ROSE:  If the Chinese were going to be building a whole new railroad.  So,  we're worrying like E.H. Harriman in the Union percent (ph) of railroad  about who's stealing our little -- we're worrying about who's stealing our  safe.  The Chinese are going around buying up the land and wanting them  changed and developing engine technology 20 years from now, we're going to  be running on Chinese trains and we're going to be wondering how did that  happened.</p><p>KEENE:  OK, then what is -- Francine's wonderful question about how do we  get together on this, where is the unifying force particularly given the  fractious politics our president's having with our allies?</p><p>ROSE:  Karen Lornbluh and Michele Flournoy and Michael Somare have pieces  in the article, in the package telling you what the United States should do  and there are a lot of things.</p><p>Again, I would look to the Indian approach of the internet as a public good  that may hold the best solution down the long road.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, but Tim Cook's stock options is not the public good.</p><p>ROSE:  The question of the regulation of capitalism in a way that is  beneficial economically, but also sustainable politically and socially is  going to be that question of the mid 21st century.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gideon, do you think any of these companies would self regulate  for real?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, just like Martin Shkreli will self regulate.</p><p>LACQUA:  It's respectively look?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, we can count on the tech companies to self regulate just like  we can count on the pharmaceutical companies to provide low-cost medicines  for everybody without regard to jacking up things when they have a cash  monopoly like it ever been (ph).</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, perfect.  So, we do a little bit of, you know, that's a  no.  But why not?  If you listen to the rationale of them regulating, it's  either you regulate or you don't survive as people stop using you because  you don't, you know, they don't trust.  This -- they make money out of  trusts, they don't make money out of selling drugs.</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, in the long run.  And in the short run, you make money by  increasing your share of things, right.  We have a president right now who  is ignoring the entire cost of a global trade war to get some short term  minor advantage in trivial little issues.</p><p>So, that kind of thinking if it can apply to the president of United States  and the entire Republican Party, it also applies to individual private  sector company managers.  So we can't rely on them to be responsible for  the entire global community down the road.</p><p>KEENE:  Gideon, thank you so much.  Your most important issue, I really  mean this folks how dumb I am on our World War Web and I've to read it  cover to cover.  I can't say enough about it.</p><p>We're going to come back.  John Ryding of RDQ Economics to dive once more  into the independence of your selected central bank and then an important  conversation with Gerard Cassidy on Fortress diamond, Fortress Moynihan in  your neighborhood bank.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us with RDQ Economics and Gerard Cassidy joins  from RBC Capital Markets and both of them have leaved every moment of this  crisis.  John, let me start with you as you go back and you look at where  we are, can you say we're out of the crisis and it's a distant memory?</p><p>RYDING:  We're out of the crisis and unfortunately it's a distant memory  because by -- it become a distant memory, it's the way that some of the  mistakes we make.  But the difference between now and then is the degree of  bank capital.</p><p>I think the system is much better buffered ad that's a positive.  I think  the unfortunate thing is in the re-regulation phase, some of the powers of  the Fed intervened have been diminished sort of length of last resort which  in the end is key when we get enterprises those -- some of those length of  last resort facilities that powers been clipped.</p><p>But, yes, it's 10 years on, banks are well capitalized and this is when we  make the mistakes that sow the seeds for the next problems.</p><p>KEENE:  And Former Fed Official and Economist John Ryder, now we go to the  trenches of securities analysis here.  Do you agree that our banks are  stronger and more resilient to the surprises that can come from 2006 and on  to 2007?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, HEAD OF U.S. BANK EQUITY STRATEGY, RBC:  Absolutely Tom,  what we've seen the banking industry has been recapitalized quite  romantically.  We haven't seen levels of capital like this in decades.</p><p>I would also point out what the Federal Reserve did though was they pushed  the risk outside the commercial banking system.  It is now in the shadow of  banking industry.  That's where the risk lies.</p><p>So when the next crisis comes, we're not going to JPMorgan or Bank of  America or Citigroup have the problems that they had last time.  But I do  worry about the hedge funds, the mutual funds, all the other outside, the  traditional-commercial banking industry, those are the folks that could  have the real problems.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, where do you think the next crisis will come from?  Is it  going to be from Asia, is it going to be away from the financial sector?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, I think in all things, the source of the crisis suppose to  what the crisis is becomes financial policy, monetary policy that's too  lose.  I still think we have lax monetary policy that leads to over  leverage, that leads to capital flow into asset classes that it shouldn't  be.</p><p>But the system is being tested.  What's happening in Turkey and the global  ramifications, that's an interesting test because we thought emerging  markets is one area that's going to be overleveraged.  But, I don't see  that so much as a systemic issue in the same way that (INAUDIBLE) turned  out to be systemic issue back in 2010.</p><p>So, capital is an important buffer to hold back those crises.  But raising  interest rates is the best way to avoid getting into it.</p><p>KEENE:   It's exceptionally time with John Ryding, thank you so much for  being with us today.  John Ryding on Fed independence, he's with RDQ  economics.  Coming up, a really important chart with Gerard Cassidy, we'll  that next.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  It's just a simple chart with Gerard Cassidy to look at here.  And  Gerard, what I want to talk about, forget about the Bull market like  Fortress Diamond and maybe back here is a Harris and like here's a great  malaise.  How does any bank institution avoid a 15 year churn?  What do you  do to avoid that?</p><p>CASSIDY:  Tom, I think that this is a phenomenal chart to have a go back as  far as you have it and you do show the two great up legs.  But there is  that period that you point out this malaise.  I think what it is, today,  the banks are more focused than ever on shareholder return.  During that  malaise period, it was the recovery coming out of the 1990 downturn, but  then you had the tech implosion in 2001.  So those two periods affected the  malaise that you identified.</p><p>KEENE:  Who into -- your universe and even bank on the cover, I understand  the game.  Who is the one that uses technology best?  Who's the  technological leader in the Cassidy world?</p><p>CASSIDY:  I would say that you have to identify probably our top banks,  including bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.  Citigroup I  would put in there as well.  So, our biggest banks are not only spending  the most money, they are also becoming the most tech savvy.  They're  embracing it.  They know the digitalization of banking is the future.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gerard, are there concerns that actually some like Facebook or  Amazon or someone else will go into banking?</p><p>CASSIDY:  I would say that we don't really have to worry about that at this  time.  And the reason being there was a large moat around commercial  banking.  If you want to take the deposits and make loans, you have to have  a banking license.  I'm not -- I don't believe that Facebook, Google, or  any of these companies want to become a bank holding company because you  will be regulated by the bank regulators which would then lead to a much  lower stock multiple.  So right now, the moat is very difficult if  impossible to cross.</p><p>LACQUA:  We love talking about banks.  We talk about capital ratios, we  talk about you know, the thick (ph) and all of that, but actually who's the  bank that's talking to millenials and is that the next frontier?</p><p>CASSIDY:  You know, it's interesting because the millenials are a very  important part of the banking system and all the banks are trying to reach  out with to them.</p><p>I was with U.S. bank core yesterday in Boston and it was very clear to me  that this company is reaching out and through their payment system, to  millennials because think of Venmo or Uber, that's the first introduction  many of these millenials have to the banking system is through payments  where many of us, Tom and I and folks first time we ever got in touch with  the bank was with the passbook savings account.  That's not the way in many  of millenials do it anymore.</p><p>So, I would say the big banks JPMorgan and Bank of America, Regional Banks  like PMC and U.S. bank are doing very good job reaching out to the  millenials.</p><p>KEENE:  Work very quickly here, when does branch banking finally throw in  the towel? tail?  I mean you go buy and nobody is them.</p><p>CASSIDY:  Tom, it's amazing what's happening.</p><p>KEENE:  It is amazing.</p><p>CASSIDY:  It truly is.  And we have some data to show you that the branch  banking peak, the year the Apple introduced the iPhone.  So, over the next  ten years I would suggest to you but probably there was another third of  the branches easily.</p><p>KEENE:  A third, very good.  Gerard Cassidy thank you so much and we'll  continue this discussion.  I'm thrilled to say with Mr. Ferro on Bloomberg  Radio here in a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We've got this incredibly important issue from Foreign Affairs. We'll get to that with Gideon Rose here a bit, but all of that is pushed aside by the President's comments in the last 24 hours on Fed independence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are thrilled to bring you this morning John Ryding of RDQ Economics. He is truly an expert on the Fed with his public service to the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, how independent is the Federal Reserve this morning?</p><p>JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ: eight says independent it was yesterday or last year or four or five years ago. In a similar way to the Supreme Court, obviously the President can influence the Fed by his nominations. And his nominations to the board have been strong.</p><p>Richard Clarida who you know very well is just an excellent choice for the Fed vice chair and I think his confirmation, you know, will go thread fairly soon.</p><p>So, we all know the President and his tendency to tweet one something or speak about something or complain about something. And maybe that's just because -- it's just the second time he's done this. It's not the normal protocol, but I don't think it influences Fed policy. But anything, the Fed may be more inclined to take a marginal action to raise rates.</p><p>And I don't think the decision to raise rates this year in September, December, you know, or even close decision. So I think two more rate hikes and we'll see by December the Fed policy was influenced.</p><p>KEENE: The team around him, David Malpass who you worked with for years at Bear Sterns. Mr. Kudlow and others, Secretary Mnuchin, did they have a voice to staunch the President's intentions whether someone politically sees them as good or bad?</p><p>RYDING: Well, they obviously have a voice. But, you know, we do have a President who at times can lash out or say things and there are also competing voices and obviously, you know, the biggest area of that is in the trade area where you've got, you know, Peter Navarro on one side of very protectionist trade agenda and Larry Kudlow with, you know, remains a free market guy. But he knows there a lot of, you know, China in particular being not a good actor on foreign policy --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Right, John?</p><p>RYDING: -- tariffs and free trade, you know, the President's taking actions against that.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. And John, for the moment, the President and his administration think that they're winning the trade war. Will China make them pay for it? Will they make them pay for it next to or closer to the midterm elections? And what would that do to big block buster U.S. companies?</p><p>RYDING: Well, Francine, nobody wins in a trade war. I think, you know, one of the almost universe if (ph) we propositions amongst most economists are the, you know, trade war's tariffs, they are welfare reducing on all sides.</p><p>So, it's not that I think that President Trump is a protectionist, it's that he thinks that tariffs because China has much larger exports to the U.S versus U.S. exports to China has more to lose. And therefore, by taking action and bringing them to the table and try and make progress in the same way that we had the start of a dialogue with the E.U.</p><p>So, I think if isn't trade war, it's not just the U.S. that pays. It's China that pays and we have to see how this plays out. I can't say I'm comfortable with it, but it's not that, you know, China can unilaterally damage the U.S. It would damage itself in the process.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, Gideon, do you think the U.S. cares?</p><p>GIDEON ROSE, CHIEF EDITOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS: So, I go with everything John just said, except the President not being a protectionist. And from -- as a social scientist, what I find absolutely fascinating about the situation is I cannot remember a previous era in which we all sat around trying to predict what the government of the United States would do when the President of the United States, is it war with his own administration.</p><p>So we have no real models are precedent for understanding what happens when the government administration, the deep state, everything goes on and does its basic stuff as John was just talking about, the professional technocrats do their stuff, but then the guy at the top of the whole system who supposedly running things for the benefit of the country and the world and in sequence coordinating all the stuff goes off on a completely separate path and undermines his own administration actions.</p><p>Whether it's in the justice department, or whether it's in the economic policy department or whether it's in the security department. And so, we actually end up doing what John just said which is discounting the President's words, but then trying to figure what actually is going to be U.S. policy. So, we don't know.</p><p>KEENE: Right, I'll just tell you on this book here in a bit on the World War Web with Gideon Rose. It may be the issue ever for them. But right here, I'm going to hold this up, the unrestrained presidency within Gideon Rose's new effort. And within that on IR, but it can be on John's economics as well, the unconstrained presidencies because the legislatures is given up. Where is the legislature to push back against this debate on Fed independence?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so --</p><p>KEENE: Still nowhere.</p><p>ROSE: So, essentially, everything in U.S. politics has become subject to a partisan lens, right. You have Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans have aligned themselves at this point completely with the President who's is the head of their party of the leader office, and essentially now there is no Republican Party except on something, it's essentially Trump. And what Trump -- but he can't do anything.</p><p>So the question is, where does the President focus his attention in his discretionary powers? And then what happens with the rest of the government when they're doing the Donald Reagan cleaning up after the elephant phase? How does that all play out and what is the net result? We don't know.</p><p>KEENE: Lots tot talk about here with John Riding and Gideon Rose. This is an important segment on the World War Web here in a bit.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us of RDQ Economics. John, how many times has the Fed raised rates? Help the President here. You mentioned two rates earlier, but how many times do they raise rates through 2019? Were there?</p><p>RYDING: I think another four times in 2019. I mean --</p><p>KEENE: Two plus four equals six.</p><p>RYDING: Well, yes, two in 2000 and the rest of 2018 and four next year. I mean, look behind, you've got a charts on the real Fed funds rate if I'm looking at your wall correctly. And that's still negative which means to say that the inflation rate's still higher than the short-term interest rate. And that's normally consistent with accommodated conditions.</p><p>The equity market is within half a percent of record high. I don't see where we've had any tightening, reduced accommodation by the Fed with the rate hike so far.</p><p>KEENE: You have been the leading voice in market economics on the idea that higher rates is a good signal for this American economy. Can you say that right now with the debt that's coming on, the deficits that's coming on?</p><p>RYDING: Look, absolutely. I mean, you know, on the one hand and you had guest in your previous how you were talking about the yield curve and the flattening of the yield curve. You know, long term interest rates still remain very low. And monetary policy isn't about conducting interest rate policy to keep the cost of servicing the debt down.</p><p>Monetary policy is about maintaining stable prices and full employment as the Fed's mandated to and it's actually doing a pretty good job of doing that. But long-term, if inflations were to get out of hand and long term interest rates were to go up, that would be a lot more damaging for funding costs from the U.S. debt than the Fed rate hikes.</p><p>LACQUA: John, do you worry about where the U.S. economy is in, you know, the cycle effect, that late cycle and that there's a huge divergence with what, you know, BOJ are doing, ECB is doing?</p><p>RYDING: Well, in terms of where we are in the cycle, I was a lot more worried in 2016. In 2016, we're seeing a macroeconomic profit squeeze in the U.S. of the kind of magnitude that signaled a potential recession problem ahead. That's a far more important signal to me than the yield curve.</p><p>We had the corporate tax sculptures (ph) and reforms are absolutely essential for reinvigorating corporate America. And now we've seen pre- text macro-profit margins widen.</p><p>Now, that may be a problem down the road with inflation. And productivity of growth rates are too low, but in some ways with the way the stock markets moving, with the way it looks like corporate profits are shaping up in the second quarter, it may be that we had a growth recession in 2015, 2016 and we may be coming out of that with stronger growth. The problem is how much slack this was we saw the life in the labor market at a 3.9 percent unemployment rate?</p><p>But so I've been surprised at how many people we have drawn in. And now, it does seem that the U.S. economy is bring in people, more marginal people in terms of education and so on into labor force for a while.</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us who will return in the next half hour on the Central Bank.</p><p>Coming up, Gideon Rose will talk about the Web, look later today on Bloomberg Surveillance on Tesla, on governance. John Coffee, Professor Coffee of course with Columbia. This is Bloomberg, stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Let's get back to Gideon Rose of Foreign Affairs and John Ryding of RDQ Economics. John, when you look at China, I just don't believe there's not a slow down. I guess the question is how the authorities deal with it. It's by stimulating the economy so they stabilize it.</p><p>RYDING: Well, the angst say slow down from what rates. So China has been growing 6.5, seven percent at least in their efficient numbers. And if you project that out on compound growth rates and that kind of growth rate cannot be sustainable over a multi-decade period. The China has to slow eventually to the more normal global growth rate as China runs out of the ability to move population from the agricultural sector into the industrial sector.</p><p>So, I think we get too hung up on what China is growing at 6.7 percent or 6.5 percent or, you know, the reality is what China needs to reorientate scope (ph) economy away from being a primarily investment economy to more of a consumer economy. And that might end up being a healthier growth rate and development for the global economy then China simply growing at a faster pace with undertaking a lot of directed investments.</p><p>LACQUA: Gideon, how would you view Chinese politics right now and how bad it actually impacts the economy? If you can you hear me? Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE: All right, a second, I can't hear you.</p><p>LACQUA: No, no one can hear me. Tom, translate for me.</p><p>KEENE: Well, we've got some audio problems going on right now. I mean, I look into the China and I look the -- well, we've got some on (ph) and we'll talk to Francine I guess is what we're going to do here across the transatlantic.</p><p>LACQUA: Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, I can hear you now Francine, sorry about that.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, I'm also hearing myself in Dolby stereo. Gideon, I was asking about Chinese politics and how Chinese politics actually influences the economy.</p><p>ROSE: So, it's actually a great question because what the Chinese actually understand I think far better than their Anglo-American counterparts is that the growth rates and the economic dynamism of the society and the progress toward on economic matters is situated within a political and social context. And so, what the Chinese government is trying to do is not just manage its growth rate and its economic policy, but also manage the entire polity of China in order to preserve the leadership of Xi Jinping and preserve stability within China and increase Chinese power.</p><p>And that broader context is actually really important because that's the kind of attention, not just to economic policy alone, but to the broader context of economics, society, and politics that economic policy makers in the west have basically intended to lose sight of which is producing a system in which there's a lot of push back and turmoil and people are getting that response (ph).</p><p>KEENE: We're going to have to leave it there. We'll get our audio straighten now and we thank you for being with us. With John Riding and Gideon Rose, please stay with us, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: With us is Gideon Rose, he is of course the Editor in Chief of Foreign Affairs. Gideon, congratulations on this. Let me get right to it. The internet has lost its promise. Discuss.</p><p>ROSE: So, thank you very much for your kind words about the issue. Basically, think of this as a four at play. In the first act, the United States government creates the fundamentals of what we'll now call the internet.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>ROSE: The communication's network and a bunch of corporate (ph) of stuff - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSE: In act two, the United States government pairs with and partners with the private sector to develop this. It makes the infrastructure generally public and then allows private sector actors to develop all sorts of applications and so forth. This is the golden age of the internet in 1990's and things like that.</p><p>Act three, this starts to fray because the system goes on autopilot. And what happens is the large private tech companies take over large portions of the internet and become a sort of oligopoly running things on their own, government regulators really don't really get involved and the interne takes on its own life.</p><p>And during chapter three, the act three, various people start to push back against the problems with the internet. The Chinese try to succeed in a cyber sovereignty in their own sphere. The Europeans try to do regulations with GDPR. The Indians try to build a new internet from the ground up on more populist public good basis. And the Americans sit around wondering, can we control the tech companies? But Americans are so embedded in an Anglo-American view of liberal capitalism in which the government lets the private sector do its stuff that American policy has allowed the internet to create problems and now other people are stepping in to fix those problems.</p><p>KEENE: You really explained, then who has the power here? As you go chapter by chapter brilliantly, is it shining with the power or is it European regulatory structure that has --</p><p>ROSE: So the great question is we don't know who's going to have the power in act four. Because what happened in act one and two was the U.S. government created the infrastructure and turned it over to the private sector to help run. And in act three, we end up getting a lot of push back. And right now, you have governments like China, you have regional regulators like those in Europe, you have private sector companies like big tech, you have the citizens in general and nobody knows who is going to control the commanding heights of the digital economy.</p><p>Like for example, data regulation, who is going to get to keep and control and monetize the data? The individuals? The companies? The governments?</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but this is (INAUDIBLE). You mentioned commanding heights which is of course Daniel Yergin in his classic book on the 90s on the 20th century. Capitalism, there were two wars in the middle of Dan Yergin's commanding heights. What's going to be the warfare equivalent of this technology in our society?</p><p>ROSE: So, it's not going to be warfare in terms of geopolitical conflict between the major powers. What's going to happen is there was a common American sponsored liberal open order of the internet. Somewhat parallel to the globalization order and American officials move that forward to get all the benefits, but they forgot that the destruction part of created destruction creates pushback and people resist. And what you're seeing now in China, in Europe, in India even in the U.S. is people reacting against an unfettered private sector dominated internet but no one knows how to reestablish control because you don't want kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs.</p><p>So, what's happening right now is the question over the future control of the internet. It's not necessarily just going to be what it was in the last couple of decades which is, the United States debating whether or not to allow tech companies to have control over things.</p><p>Now, other global players are in fact going to be an important to this.</p><p>KEENE: Then how do you respond to the news just in the last 24 hours Apple limit x number of apps to China. I mean with their new chapter on China, they're making the rules, we're not. And even Tim Cook, Chief Operating officer of Tesla down Tim Cook has to vow to China.</p><p>ROSE: So what I feel about this is it's a little bit like the economic nationalism in other areas that we're seeing, right. Globalization races forward, it produces lots of wonderful things, lots of creative destruction and turmoil, but it also produces pushback and problems for people inside major developed western countries which causes them to want to put breaks in the process.</p><p>Take -- the fact is the Chinese are doing the same thing with the internet and just like American economic nationalist and populists and British wants and up places elsewhere want to hide off their economies from the globe and establish sovereignty, so the Chinese are trying to do the same thing for the internet.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, but we're talking about the different things, right. Gideon, on the one side, it's like cybersecurity and I guess, you know, the cyber race on who will have supremacy between China and the U.S. The other one is simply who is in the third act. It could be regulators, right. And this is Europe. Europe is leading a forefront regulation on automated (ph) passes pushback against it, but when it comes to data protection, these are the new people in town.</p><p>ROSE: Yes, but it's actually there are several competitors trying to do the same thing and we don't know which way of controlling the problems is going to win out. The European approach is regulation for the whole system, OK. The Chinese approaches secession from the system. Cyber sovereignty eventually the goal of that is to create essentially a splinternet in which there's a general public internet but the Chinese have build their own platforms, their own systems in 20 years in effect it'll be much more of a Chinese dominated internet than American dominated one.</p><p>The Indians want to reengineer the whole thing from the ground up. Fascinating article by Nandan Nilekani from emphasis abut what the Indians are doing in internet policy, maybe the most impressive and interesting of all the different approaches even though we don't hear much about it. And basically United States we're still wondering what to do because we don't basically have the conceptual ability to direct companies the way the government wants. And so, for the public ones.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Talk to me about regulation because there's a great article in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs written by Helen Dixon saying regulate to liberate, can Europe save the internet? Can it?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so this is the great question. We tried to present a fair picture of this whole big debate. It's going forward on the future. So the lead piece in the package is by Adam Siegel talking about the transition of power from United States to China. Helen Dixon's article expresses the European approach which is no, it doesn't have to be the U.S. approach or the Chinese separate one, we can regulate it. Nandan Nilekani talks about the Indian one. We also have a number of different pieces on specific challenges of cyber security.</p><p>You should look at the European approach, the Chinese approach, the Indian approach and the American approach as variance of the same thing. Now that we've unleashed the wonderful creative destruction of digital technology, how do we keep it going forward in a positive way while controlling the social and political effects of all of this creative destruction?</p><p>LACQUA: Would these nations ever come together, Gideon? I don't know if whether it's a plaza accord for the internet. But, you know, that's the kind of idea.</p><p>ROSE: So, if people like John Ryding were controlling this stuff, then the answer would be yes because there's an obvious benefit for people to come together in a collective action coordination solution to read the benefits of a coordinated policy with central regulation.</p><p>But the problem is right now we have a tied international politics in the United States and elsewhere which is going inward rather than collective and I think the answer is we're moving towards a splinternet more than we are towards a new revelation.</p><p>KEENE: I love -- can we steal that words splinternet you get a royalty on that.</p><p>ROSE: It's not mine but it's a favorite --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Here's the New York Times today folks, I'll read it for you. Russian hackers broaden the tax to consumers. First of all, I've got to make some news here with the counsel and foreign relations hack by Russians as well in this article?</p><p>ROSE: Like everybody else, we're constantly fished and attacked by various different actors. But that's just -- the Russians don't bother me as much. The Russians are like Butch Cassidy on the Sundance kid harassing the railroad.</p><p>KEENE: OK, who's the Katherine Losse (ph) of the World War Web? That's a Butch Cassidy.</p><p>ROSE: If the Chinese were going to be building a whole new railroad. So, we're worrying like E.H. Harriman in the Union percent (ph) of railroad about who's stealing our little -- we're worrying about who's stealing our safe. The Chinese are going around buying up the land and wanting them changed and developing engine technology 20 years from now, we're going to be running on Chinese trains and we're going to be wondering how did that happened.</p><p>KEENE: OK, then what is -- Francine's wonderful question about how do we get together on this, where is the unifying force particularly given the fractious politics our president's having with our allies?</p><p>ROSE: Karen Lornbluh and Michele Flournoy and Michael Somare have pieces in the article, in the package telling you what the United States should do and there are a lot of things.</p><p>Again, I would look to the Indian approach of the internet as a public good that may hold the best solution down the long road.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but Tim Cook's stock options is not the public good.</p><p>ROSE: The question of the regulation of capitalism in a way that is beneficial economically, but also sustainable politically and socially is going to be that question of the mid 21st century.</p><p>LACQUA: Gideon, do you think any of these companies would self regulate for real?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, just like Martin Shkreli will self regulate.</p><p>LACQUA: It's respectively look?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, we can count on the tech companies to self regulate just like we can count on the pharmaceutical companies to provide low-cost medicines for everybody without regard to jacking up things when they have a cash monopoly like it ever been (ph).</p><p>LACQUA: All right, perfect. So, we do a little bit of, you know, that's a no. But why not? If you listen to the rationale of them regulating, it's either you regulate or you don't survive as people stop using you because you don't, you know, they don't trust. This -- they make money out of trusts, they don't make money out of selling drugs.</p><p>ROSE: Yes, in the long run. And in the short run, you make money by increasing your share of things, right. We have a president right now who is ignoring the entire cost of a global trade war to get some short term minor advantage in trivial little issues.</p><p>So, that kind of thinking if it can apply to the president of United States and the entire Republican Party, it also applies to individual private sector company managers. So we can't rely on them to be responsible for the entire global community down the road.</p><p>KEENE: Gideon, thank you so much. Your most important issue, I really mean this folks how dumb I am on our World War Web and I've to read it cover to cover. I can't say enough about it.</p><p>We're going to come back. John Ryding of RDQ Economics to dive once more into the independence of your selected central bank and then an important conversation with Gerard Cassidy on Fortress diamond, Fortress Moynihan in your neighborhood bank.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us with RDQ Economics and Gerard Cassidy joins from RBC Capital Markets and both of them have leaved every moment of this crisis. John, let me start with you as you go back and you look at where we are, can you say we're out of the crisis and it's a distant memory?</p><p>RYDING: We're out of the crisis and unfortunately it's a distant memory because by -- it become a distant memory, it's the way that some of the mistakes we make. But the difference between now and then is the degree of bank capital.</p><p>I think the system is much better buffered ad that's a positive. I think the unfortunate thing is in the re-regulation phase, some of the powers of the Fed intervened have been diminished sort of length of last resort which in the end is key when we get enterprises those -- some of those length of last resort facilities that powers been clipped.</p><p>But, yes, it's 10 years on, banks are well capitalized and this is when we make the mistakes that sow the seeds for the next problems.</p><p>KEENE: And Former Fed Official and Economist John Ryder, now we go to the trenches of securities analysis here. Do you agree that our banks are stronger and more resilient to the surprises that can come from 2006 and on to 2007?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, HEAD OF U.S. BANK EQUITY STRATEGY, RBC: Absolutely Tom, what we've seen the banking industry has been recapitalized quite romantically. We haven't seen levels of capital like this in decades.</p><p>I would also point out what the Federal Reserve did though was they pushed the risk outside the commercial banking system. It is now in the shadow of banking industry. That's where the risk lies.</p><p>So when the next crisis comes, we're not going to JPMorgan or Bank of America or Citigroup have the problems that they had last time. But I do worry about the hedge funds, the mutual funds, all the other outside, the traditional-commercial banking industry, those are the folks that could have the real problems.</p><p>LACQUA: John, where do you think the next crisis will come from? Is it going to be from Asia, is it going to be away from the financial sector?</p><p>RYDING: Well, I think in all things, the source of the crisis suppose to what the crisis is becomes financial policy, monetary policy that's too lose. I still think we have lax monetary policy that leads to over leverage, that leads to capital flow into asset classes that it shouldn't be.</p><p>But the system is being tested. What's happening in Turkey and the global ramifications, that's an interesting test because we thought emerging markets is one area that's going to be overleveraged. But, I don't see that so much as a systemic issue in the same way that (INAUDIBLE) turned out to be systemic issue back in 2010.</p><p>So, capital is an important buffer to hold back those crises. But raising interest rates is the best way to avoid getting into it.</p><p>KEENE: It's exceptionally time with John Ryding, thank you so much for being with us today. John Ryding on Fed independence, he's with RDQ economics. Coming up, a really important chart with Gerard Cassidy, we'll that next. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: It's just a simple chart with Gerard Cassidy to look at here. And Gerard, what I want to talk about, forget about the Bull market like Fortress Diamond and maybe back here is a Harris and like here's a great malaise. How does any bank institution avoid a 15 year churn? What do you do to avoid that?</p><p>CASSIDY: Tom, I think that this is a phenomenal chart to have a go back as far as you have it and you do show the two great up legs. But there is that period that you point out this malaise. I think what it is, today, the banks are more focused than ever on shareholder return. During that malaise period, it was the recovery coming out of the 1990 downturn, but then you had the tech implosion in 2001. So those two periods affected the malaise that you identified.</p><p>KEENE: Who into -- your universe and even bank on the cover, I understand the game. Who is the one that uses technology best? Who's the technological leader in the Cassidy world?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say that you have to identify probably our top banks, including bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Citigroup I would put in there as well. So, our biggest banks are not only spending the most money, they are also becoming the most tech savvy. They're embracing it. They know the digitalization of banking is the future.</p><p>LACQUA: Gerard, are there concerns that actually some like Facebook or Amazon or someone else will go into banking?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say that we don't really have to worry about that at this time. And the reason being there was a large moat around commercial banking. If you want to take the deposits and make loans, you have to have a banking license. I'm not -- I don't believe that Facebook, Google, or any of these companies want to become a bank holding company because you will be regulated by the bank regulators which would then lead to a much lower stock multiple. So right now, the moat is very difficult if impossible to cross.</p><p>LACQUA: We love talking about banks. We talk about capital ratios, we talk about you know, the thick (ph) and all of that, but actually who's the bank that's talking to millenials and is that the next frontier?</p><p>CASSIDY: You know, it's interesting because the millenials are a very important part of the banking system and all the banks are trying to reach out with to them.</p><p>I was with U.S. bank core yesterday in Boston and it was very clear to me that this company is reaching out and through their payment system, to millennials because think of Venmo or Uber, that's the first introduction many of these millenials have to the banking system is through payments where many of us, Tom and I and folks first time we ever got in touch with the bank was with the passbook savings account. That's not the way in many of millenials do it anymore.</p><p>So, I would say the big banks JPMorgan and Bank of America, Regional Banks like PMC and U.S. bank are doing very good job reaching out to the millenials.</p><p>KEENE: Work very quickly here, when does branch banking finally throw in the towel? tail? I mean you go buy and nobody is them.</p><p>CASSIDY: Tom, it's amazing what's happening.</p><p>KEENE: It is amazing.</p><p>CASSIDY: It truly is. And we have some data to show you that the branch banking peak, the year the Apple introduced the iPhone. So, over the next ten years I would suggest to you but probably there was another third of the branches easily.</p><p>KEENE: A third, very good. Gerard Cassidy thank you so much and we'll continue this discussion. I'm thrilled to say with Mr. Ferro on Bloomberg Radio here in a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">35 minutes</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  This is a wonderful hour, Gerard Cassidy to  join us later on banking.  We've got this incredibly important issue from  Foreign Affairs.  We'll get to that with Gideon Rose here a bit, but all of  that is pushed aside by the President's comments in the last 24 hours on  Fed independence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are thrilled to bring you this morning John Ryding of RDQ Economics.  He  is truly an expert on the Fed with his public service to the Bank of  England and the Federal Reserve System.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, how independent is the Federal Reserve this morning?</p><p>JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ:  eight says independent it was yesterday  or last year or four or five years ago.  In a similar way to the Supreme  Court, obviously the President can influence the Fed by his nominations.   And his nominations to the board have been strong.</p><p>Richard Clarida who you know very well is just an excellent choice for the  Fed vice chair and I think his confirmation, you know, will go thread  fairly soon.</p><p>So, we all know the President and his tendency to tweet one something or  speak about something or complain about something.  And maybe that's just  because -- it's just the second time he's done this.  It's not the normal  protocol, but I don't think it influences Fed policy.  But anything, the  Fed may be more inclined to take a marginal action to raise rates.</p><p>And I don't think the decision to raise rates this year in September,  December, you know, or even close decision.  So I think two more rate hikes  and we'll see by December the Fed policy was influenced.</p><p>KEENE:  The team around him, David Malpass who you worked with for years at  Bear Sterns.  Mr. Kudlow and others, Secretary Mnuchin, did they have a  voice to staunch the President's intentions whether someone politically  sees them as good or bad?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, they obviously have a voice.  But, you know, we do have a  President who at times can lash out or say things and there are also  competing voices and obviously, you know, the biggest area of that is in  the trade area where you've got, you know, Peter Navarro on one side of  very protectionist trade agenda and Larry Kudlow with, you know, remains a  free market guy.  But he knows there a lot of, you know, China in  particular being not a good actor on foreign policy --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Right, John?</p><p>RYDING:  -- tariffs and free trade, you know, the President's taking  actions against that.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  And John, for the moment, the President and his  administration think that they're winning the trade war.  Will China make  them pay for it?  Will they make them pay for it next to or closer to the  midterm elections?  And what would that do to big block buster U.S.  companies?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, Francine, nobody wins in a trade war.  I think, you know,  one of the almost universe if (ph) we propositions amongst most economists  are the, you know, trade war's tariffs, they are welfare reducing on all  sides.</p><p>So, it's not that I think that President Trump is a protectionist, it's  that he thinks that tariffs because China has much larger exports to the  U.S versus U.S. exports to China has more to lose.  And therefore, by  taking action and bringing them to the table and try and make progress in  the same way that we had the start of a dialogue with the E.U.</p><p>So, I think if isn't trade war, it's not just the U.S. that pays.  It's  China that pays and we have to see how this plays out.  I can't say I'm  comfortable with it, but it's not that, you know, China can unilaterally  damage the U.S.  It would damage itself in the process.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, Gideon, do you think the U.S. cares?</p><p>GIDEON ROSE, CHIEF EDITOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  So, I go with everything John  just said, except the President not being a protectionist.  And from -- as  a social scientist, what I find absolutely fascinating about the situation  is I cannot remember a previous era in which we all sat around trying to  predict what the government of the United States would do when the  President of the United States, is it war with his own administration.</p><p>So we have no real models are precedent for understanding what happens when  the government administration, the deep state, everything goes on and does  its basic stuff as John was just talking about, the professional  technocrats do their stuff, but then the guy at the top of the whole system  who supposedly running things for the benefit of the country and the world  and in sequence coordinating all the stuff goes off on a completely  separate path and undermines his own administration actions.</p><p>Whether it's in the justice department, or whether it's in the economic  policy department or whether it's in the security department.  And so, we  actually end up doing what John just said which is discounting the  President's words, but then trying to figure what actually is going to be  U.S. policy.  So, we don't know.</p><p>KEENE:  Right, I'll just tell you on this book here in a bit on the World  War Web with Gideon Rose.  It may be the issue ever for them.  But right  here, I'm going to hold this up, the unrestrained presidency within Gideon  Rose's new effort.  And within that on IR, but it can be on John's  economics as well, the unconstrained presidencies because the legislatures  is given up.  Where is the legislature to push back against this debate on  Fed independence?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so --</p><p>KEENE:  Still nowhere.</p><p>ROSE:  So, essentially, everything in U.S. politics has become subject to a  partisan lens, right.  You have Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans  have aligned themselves at this point completely with the President who's  is the head of their party of the leader office, and essentially now there  is no Republican Party except on something, it's essentially Trump.  And  what Trump -- but he can't do anything.</p><p>So the question is, where does the President focus his attention in his  discretionary powers?  And then what happens with the rest of the  government when they're doing the Donald Reagan cleaning up after the  elephant phase?  How does that all play out and what is the net result?  We  don't know.</p><p>KEENE:  Lots tot talk about here with John Riding and Gideon Rose.  This is  an important segment on the World War Web here in a bit.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us of RDQ Economics.  John, how many times has the  Fed raised rates?  Help the President here.  You mentioned two rates  earlier, but how many times do they raise rates through 2019?  Were there?</p><p>RYDING:  I think another four times in 2019.  I mean --</p><p>KEENE:  Two plus four equals six.</p><p>RYDING:  Well, yes, two in 2000 and the rest of 2018 and four next year.  I  mean, look behind, you've got a charts on the real Fed funds rate if I'm  looking at your wall correctly.  And that's still negative which means to  say that the inflation rate's still higher than the short-term interest  rate.  And that's normally consistent with accommodated conditions.</p><p>The equity market is within half a percent of record high.  I don't see  where we've had any tightening, reduced accommodation by the Fed with the  rate hike so far.</p><p>KEENE:  You have been the leading voice in market economics on the idea  that higher rates is a good signal for this American economy.  Can you say  that right now with the debt that's coming on, the deficits that's coming  on?</p><p>RYDING:  Look, absolutely.  I mean, you know, on the one hand and you had  guest in your previous how you were talking about the yield curve and the  flattening of the yield curve.  You know, long term interest rates still  remain very low.  And monetary policy isn't about conducting interest rate  policy to keep the cost of servicing the debt down.</p><p>Monetary policy is about maintaining stable prices and full employment as  the Fed's mandated to and it's actually doing a pretty good job of doing  that.  But long-term, if inflations were to get out of hand and long term  interest rates were to go up, that would be a lot more damaging for funding  costs from the U.S. debt than the Fed rate hikes.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, do you worry about where the U.S. economy is in, you know,  the cycle effect, that late cycle and that there's a huge divergence with  what, you know, BOJ are doing, ECB is doing?</p><p>RYDING: Well, in terms of where we are in the cycle, I was a lot more  worried in 2016.  In 2016, we're seeing a macroeconomic profit squeeze in  the U.S. of the kind of magnitude that signaled a potential recession  problem ahead.  That's a far more important signal to me than the yield  curve.</p><p>We had the corporate tax sculptures (ph) and reforms are absolutely  essential for reinvigorating corporate America.  And now we've seen pre- text macro-profit margins widen.</p><p>Now, that may be a problem down the road with inflation.  And productivity  of growth rates are too low, but in some ways with the way the stock  markets moving, with the way it looks like corporate profits are shaping up  in the second quarter, it may be that we had a growth recession in 2015,  2016 and we may be coming out of that with stronger growth.  The problem is  how much slack this was we saw the life in the labor market at a 3.9  percent unemployment rate?</p><p>But so I've been surprised at how many people we have drawn in.  And now,  it does seem that the U.S. economy is bring in people, more marginal people  in terms of education and so on into labor force for a while.</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us who will return in the next half hour on the  Central Bank.</p><p>Coming up, Gideon Rose will talk about the Web, look later today on  Bloomberg Surveillance on Tesla, on governance.  John Coffee, Professor  Coffee of course with Columbia.  This is Bloomberg, stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Let's get back to Gideon Rose of Foreign Affairs and John Ryding  of RDQ Economics.  John, when you look at China, I just don't believe  there's not a slow down.  I guess the question is how the authorities deal  with it.  It's by stimulating the economy so they stabilize it.</p><p>RYDING:  Well, the angst say slow down from what rates.  So China has been  growing 6.5, seven percent at least in their efficient numbers.  And if you  project that out on compound growth rates and that kind of growth rate  cannot be sustainable over a multi-decade period.  The China has to slow  eventually to the more normal global growth rate as China runs out of the  ability to move population from the agricultural sector into the industrial  sector.</p><p>So, I think we get too hung up on what China is growing at 6.7 percent or  6.5 percent or, you know, the reality is what China needs to reorientate  scope (ph) economy away from being a primarily investment economy to more  of a consumer economy.  And that might end up being a healthier growth rate  and development for the global economy then China simply growing at a  faster pace with undertaking a lot of directed investments.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gideon, how would you view Chinese politics right now and how bad  it actually impacts the economy?  If you can you hear me?  Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE:  All right, a second, I can't hear you.</p><p>LACQUA:  No, no one can hear me.  Tom, translate for me.</p><p>KEENE:  Well, we've got some audio problems going on right now.  I mean, I  look into the China and I look the -- well, we've got some on (ph) and  we'll talk to Francine I guess is what we're going to do here across the  transatlantic.</p><p>LACQUA:  Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, I can hear you now Francine, sorry about that.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK, I'm also hearing myself in Dolby stereo.  Gideon, I was asking  about Chinese politics and how Chinese politics actually influences the  economy.</p><p>ROSE:  So, it's actually a great question because what the Chinese actually  understand I think far better than their Anglo-American counterparts is  that the growth rates and the economic dynamism of the society and the  progress toward on economic matters is situated within a political and  social context.  And so, what the Chinese government is trying to do is not  just manage its growth rate and its economic policy, but also manage the  entire polity of China in order to preserve the leadership of Xi Jinping  and preserve stability within China and increase Chinese power.</p><p>And that broader context is actually really important because that's the  kind of attention, not just to economic policy alone, but to the broader  context of economics, society, and politics that economic policy makers in  the west have basically intended to lose sight of which is producing a  system in which there's a lot of push back and turmoil and people are  getting that response (ph).</p><p>KEENE:  We're going to have to leave it there.  We'll get our audio  straighten now and we thank you for being with us.  With John Riding and  Gideon Rose, please stay with us, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  With us is Gideon Rose, he is of course the Editor in Chief of  Foreign Affairs.  Gideon, congratulations on this.  Let me get right to it.   The internet has lost its promise.   Discuss.</p><p>ROSE:  So, thank you very much for your kind words about the issue.   Basically, think of this as a four at play.  In the first act, the United  States government creates the fundamentals of what we'll now call the  internet.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>ROSE:  The communication's network and a bunch of corporate (ph) of stuff - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSE:  In act two, the United States government pairs with and partners  with the private sector to develop this.  It makes the infrastructure  generally public and then allows private sector actors to develop all sorts  of applications and so forth.  This is the golden age of the internet in  1990's and things like that.</p><p>Act three, this starts to fray because the system goes on autopilot.  And  what happens is the large private tech companies take over large portions  of the internet and become a sort of oligopoly running things on their own,  government regulators really don't really get involved and the interne  takes on its own life.</p><p>And during chapter three, the act three, various people start to push back  against the problems with the internet.  The Chinese try to succeed in a  cyber sovereignty in their own sphere.  The Europeans try to do regulations  with GDPR.  The Indians try to build a new internet from the ground up on  more populist public good basis.  And the Americans sit around wondering,  can we control the tech companies?  But Americans are so embedded in an  Anglo-American view of liberal capitalism in which the government lets the  private sector do its stuff that American policy has allowed the internet  to create problems and now other people are stepping in to fix those  problems.</p><p>KEENE:  You really explained, then who has the power here?  As you go  chapter by chapter brilliantly, is it shining with the power or is it  European regulatory structure that has --</p><p>ROSE:  So the great question is we don't know who's going to have the power  in act four.  Because what happened in act one and two was the U.S.  government created the infrastructure and turned it over to the private  sector to help run.  And in act three, we end up getting a lot of push  back.  And right now, you have governments like China, you have regional  regulators like those in Europe, you have private sector companies like big  tech, you have the citizens in general and nobody knows who is going to  control the commanding heights of the digital economy.</p><p>Like for example, data regulation, who is going to get to keep and control  and monetize the data?  The individuals?  The companies?  The governments?</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, but this is (INAUDIBLE).  You mentioned commanding heights  which is of course Daniel Yergin in his classic book on the 90s on the 20th  century.  Capitalism, there were two wars in the middle of Dan Yergin's  commanding heights.  What's going to be the warfare equivalent of this  technology in our society?</p><p>ROSE:  So, it's not going to be warfare in terms of geopolitical conflict  between the major powers.  What's going to happen is there was a common  American sponsored liberal open order of the internet.  Somewhat parallel  to the globalization order and American officials move that forward to get  all the benefits, but they forgot that the destruction part of created  destruction creates pushback and people resist.  And what you're seeing now  in China, in Europe, in India even in the U.S. is people reacting against  an unfettered private sector dominated internet but no one knows how to  reestablish control because you don't want kill the goose that's laying the  golden eggs.</p><p>So, what's happening right now is the question over the future control of  the internet.  It's not necessarily just going to be what it was in the  last couple of decades which is, the United States debating whether or not  to allow tech companies to have control over things.</p><p>Now, other global players are in fact going to be an important to this.</p><p>KEENE:  Then how do you respond to the news just in the last 24 hours Apple  limit x number of apps to China.  I mean with their new chapter on China,  they're making the rules, we're not.  And even Tim Cook, Chief Operating  officer of Tesla down Tim Cook has to vow to China.</p><p>ROSE:  So what I feel about this is it's a little bit like the economic  nationalism in other areas that we're seeing, right.  Globalization races  forward, it produces lots of wonderful things, lots of creative destruction  and turmoil, but it also produces pushback and problems for people inside  major developed western countries which causes them to want to put breaks  in the process.</p><p>Take -- the fact is the Chinese are doing the same thing with the internet  and just like American economic nationalist and populists and British wants  and up places elsewhere want to hide off their economies from the globe and  establish sovereignty, so the Chinese are trying to do the same thing for  the internet.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, but we're talking about the different things, right.   Gideon, on the one side, it's like cybersecurity and I guess, you know, the  cyber race on who will have supremacy between China and the U.S.  The other  one is simply who is in the third act.  It could be regulators, right.  And  this is Europe.  Europe is leading a forefront regulation on automated (ph)  passes pushback against it, but when it comes to data protection, these are  the new people in town.</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, but it's actually there are several competitors trying to do  the same thing and we don't know which way of controlling the problems is  going to win out.  The European approach is regulation for the whole  system, OK.  The Chinese approaches secession from the system.  Cyber  sovereignty eventually the goal of that is to create essentially a  splinternet in which there's a general public internet but the Chinese have  build their own platforms, their own systems in 20 years in effect it'll be  much more of a Chinese dominated internet than American dominated one.</p><p>The Indians want to reengineer the whole thing from the ground up.   Fascinating article by Nandan Nilekani from emphasis abut what the Indians  are doing in internet policy, maybe the most impressive and interesting of  all the different approaches even though we don't hear much about it.  And  basically United States we're still wondering what to do because we don't  basically have the conceptual ability to direct companies the way the  government wants.  And so, for the public ones.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Talk to me about regulation because there's a great article  in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs written by Helen Dixon saying  regulate to liberate, can Europe save the internet?  Can it?</p><p>ROSE:  Well, so this is the great question.  We tried to present a fair  picture of this whole big debate.  It's going forward on the future.  So  the lead piece in the package is by Adam Siegel talking about the  transition of power from United States to China.  Helen Dixon's article  expresses the European approach which is no, it doesn't have to be the U.S.  approach or the Chinese separate one, we can regulate it.  Nandan Nilekani  talks about the Indian one.  We also have a number of different pieces on  specific challenges of cyber security.</p><p>You should look at the European approach, the Chinese approach, the Indian  approach and the American approach as variance of the same thing.  Now that  we've unleashed the wonderful creative destruction of digital technology,  how do we keep it going forward in a positive way while controlling the  social and political effects of all of this creative destruction?</p><p>LACQUA:  Would these nations ever come together, Gideon?  I don't know if  whether it's a plaza accord for the internet.  But, you know, that's the  kind of idea.</p><p>ROSE:  So, if people like John Ryding were controlling this stuff, then the  answer would be yes because there's an obvious benefit for people to come  together in a collective action coordination solution to read the benefits  of a coordinated policy with central regulation.</p><p>But the problem is right now we have a tied international politics in the  United States and elsewhere which is going inward rather than collective  and I think the answer is we're moving towards a splinternet more than we  are towards a new revelation.</p><p>KEENE:  I love -- can we steal that words splinternet you get a royalty on  that.</p><p>ROSE:  It's not mine but it's a favorite --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Here's the New York Times today folks, I'll read it for you.   Russian hackers broaden the tax to consumers.  First of all, I've got to  make some news here with the counsel and foreign relations hack by Russians  as well in this article?</p><p>ROSE:  Like everybody else, we're constantly fished and attacked by various  different actors.  But that's just -- the Russians don't bother me as much.   The Russians are like Butch Cassidy on the Sundance kid harassing the  railroad.</p><p>KEENE:  OK, who's the Katherine Losse (ph) of the World War Web?  That's a  Butch Cassidy.</p><p>ROSE:  If the Chinese were going to be building a whole new railroad.  So,  we're worrying like E.H. Harriman in the Union percent (ph) of railroad  about who's stealing our little -- we're worrying about who's stealing our  safe.  The Chinese are going around buying up the land and wanting them  changed and developing engine technology 20 years from now, we're going to  be running on Chinese trains and we're going to be wondering how did that  happened.</p><p>KEENE:  OK, then what is -- Francine's wonderful question about how do we  get together on this, where is the unifying force particularly given the  fractious politics our president's having with our allies?</p><p>ROSE:  Karen Lornbluh and Michele Flournoy and Michael Somare have pieces  in the article, in the package telling you what the United States should do  and there are a lot of things.</p><p>Again, I would look to the Indian approach of the internet as a public good  that may hold the best solution down the long road.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, but Tim Cook's stock options is not the public good.</p><p>ROSE:  The question of the regulation of capitalism in a way that is  beneficial economically, but also sustainable politically and socially is  going to be that question of the mid 21st century.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gideon, do you think any of these companies would self regulate  for real?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, just like Martin Shkreli will self regulate.</p><p>LACQUA:  It's respectively look?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, we can count on the tech companies to self regulate just like  we can count on the pharmaceutical companies to provide low-cost medicines  for everybody without regard to jacking up things when they have a cash  monopoly like it ever been (ph).</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, perfect.  So, we do a little bit of, you know, that's a  no.  But why not?  If you listen to the rationale of them regulating, it's  either you regulate or you don't survive as people stop using you because  you don't, you know, they don't trust.  This -- they make money out of  trusts, they don't make money out of selling drugs.</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, in the long run.  And in the short run, you make money by  increasing your share of things, right.  We have a president right now who  is ignoring the entire cost of a global trade war to get some short term  minor advantage in trivial little issues.</p><p>So, that kind of thinking if it can apply to the president of United States  and the entire Republican Party, it also applies to individual private  sector company managers.  So we can't rely on them to be responsible for  the entire global community down the road.</p><p>KEENE:  Gideon, thank you so much.  Your most important issue, I really  mean this folks how dumb I am on our World War Web and I've to read it  cover to cover.  I can't say enough about it.</p><p>We're going to come back.  John Ryding of RDQ Economics to dive once more  into the independence of your selected central bank and then an important  conversation with Gerard Cassidy on Fortress diamond, Fortress Moynihan in  your neighborhood bank.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  John Ryding with us with RDQ Economics and Gerard Cassidy joins  from RBC Capital Markets and both of them have leaved every moment of this  crisis.  John, let me start with you as you go back and you look at where  we are, can you say we're out of the crisis and it's a distant memory?</p><p>RYDING:  We're out of the crisis and unfortunately it's a distant memory  because by -- it become a distant memory, it's the way that some of the  mistakes we make.  But the difference between now and then is the degree of  bank capital.</p><p>I think the system is much better buffered ad that's a positive.  I think  the unfortunate thing is in the re-regulation phase, some of the powers of  the Fed intervened have been diminished sort of length of last resort which  in the end is key when we get enterprises those -- some of those length of  last resort facilities that powers been clipped.</p><p>But, yes, it's 10 years on, banks are well capitalized and this is when we  make the mistakes that sow the seeds for the next problems.</p><p>KEENE:  And Former Fed Official and Economist John Ryder, now we go to the  trenches of securities analysis here.  Do you agree that our banks are  stronger and more resilient to the surprises that can come from 2006 and on  to 2007?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, HEAD OF U.S. BANK EQUITY STRATEGY, RBC:  Absolutely Tom,  what we've seen the banking industry has been recapitalized quite  romantically.  We haven't seen levels of capital like this in decades.</p><p>I would also point out what the Federal Reserve did though was they pushed  the risk outside the commercial banking system.  It is now in the shadow of  banking industry.  That's where the risk lies.</p><p>So when the next crisis comes, we're not going to JPMorgan or Bank of  America or Citigroup have the problems that they had last time.  But I do  worry about the hedge funds, the mutual funds, all the other outside, the  traditional-commercial banking industry, those are the folks that could  have the real problems.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, where do you think the next crisis will come from?  Is it  going to be from Asia, is it going to be away from the financial sector?</p><p>RYDING:  Well, I think in all things, the source of the crisis suppose to  what the crisis is becomes financial policy, monetary policy that's too  lose.  I still think we have lax monetary policy that leads to over  leverage, that leads to capital flow into asset classes that it shouldn't  be.</p><p>But the system is being tested.  What's happening in Turkey and the global  ramifications, that's an interesting test because we thought emerging  markets is one area that's going to be overleveraged.  But, I don't see  that so much as a systemic issue in the same way that (INAUDIBLE) turned  out to be systemic issue back in 2010.</p><p>So, capital is an important buffer to hold back those crises.  But raising  interest rates is the best way to avoid getting into it.</p><p>KEENE:   It's exceptionally time with John Ryding, thank you so much for  being with us today.  John Ryding on Fed independence, he's with RDQ  economics.  Coming up, a really important chart with Gerard Cassidy, we'll  that next.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  It's just a simple chart with Gerard Cassidy to look at here.  And  Gerard, what I want to talk about, forget about the Bull market like  Fortress Diamond and maybe back here is a Harris and like here's a great  malaise.  How does any bank institution avoid a 15 year churn?  What do you  do to avoid that?</p><p>CASSIDY:  Tom, I think that this is a phenomenal chart to have a go back as  far as you have it and you do show the two great up legs.  But there is  that period that you point out this malaise.  I think what it is, today,  the banks are more focused than ever on shareholder return.  During that  malaise period, it was the recovery coming out of the 1990 downturn, but  then you had the tech implosion in 2001.  So those two periods affected the  malaise that you identified.</p><p>KEENE:  Who into -- your universe and even bank on the cover, I understand  the game.  Who is the one that uses technology best?  Who's the  technological leader in the Cassidy world?</p><p>CASSIDY:  I would say that you have to identify probably our top banks,  including bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.  Citigroup I  would put in there as well.  So, our biggest banks are not only spending  the most money, they are also becoming the most tech savvy.  They're  embracing it.  They know the digitalization of banking is the future.</p><p>LACQUA:  Gerard, are there concerns that actually some like Facebook or  Amazon or someone else will go into banking?</p><p>CASSIDY:  I would say that we don't really have to worry about that at this  time.  And the reason being there was a large moat around commercial  banking.  If you want to take the deposits and make loans, you have to have  a banking license.  I'm not -- I don't believe that Facebook, Google, or  any of these companies want to become a bank holding company because you  will be regulated by the bank regulators which would then lead to a much  lower stock multiple.  So right now, the moat is very difficult if  impossible to cross.</p><p>LACQUA:  We love talking about banks.  We talk about capital ratios, we  talk about you know, the thick (ph) and all of that, but actually who's the  bank that's talking to millenials and is that the next frontier?</p><p>CASSIDY:  You know, it's interesting because the millenials are a very  important part of the banking system and all the banks are trying to reach  out with to them.</p><p>I was with U.S. bank core yesterday in Boston and it was very clear to me  that this company is reaching out and through their payment system, to  millennials because think of Venmo or Uber, that's the first introduction  many of these millenials have to the banking system is through payments  where many of us, Tom and I and folks first time we ever got in touch with  the bank was with the passbook savings account.  That's not the way in many  of millenials do it anymore.</p><p>So, I would say the big banks JPMorgan and Bank of America, Regional Banks  like PMC and U.S. bank are doing very good job reaching out to the  millenials.</p><p>KEENE:  Work very quickly here, when does branch banking finally throw in  the towel? tail?  I mean you go buy and nobody is them.</p><p>CASSIDY:  Tom, it's amazing what's happening.</p><p>KEENE:  It is amazing.</p><p>CASSIDY:  It truly is.  And we have some data to show you that the branch  banking peak, the year the Apple introduced the iPhone.  So, over the next  ten years I would suggest to you but probably there was another third of  the branches easily.</p><p>KEENE:  A third, very good.  Gerard Cassidy thank you so much and we'll  continue this discussion.  I'm thrilled to say with Mr. Ferro on Bloomberg  Radio here in a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">35 minutes</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: This is a wonderful hour, Gerard Cassidy to join us later on banking. We've got this incredibly important issue from Foreign Affairs. We'll get to that with Gideon Rose here a bit, but all of that is pushed aside by the President's comments in the last 24 hours on Fed independence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are thrilled to bring you this morning John Ryding of RDQ Economics. He is truly an expert on the Fed with his public service to the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John, how independent is the Federal Reserve this morning?</p><p>JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ: eight says independent it was yesterday or last year or four or five years ago. In a similar way to the Supreme Court, obviously the President can influence the Fed by his nominations. And his nominations to the board have been strong.</p><p>Richard Clarida who you know very well is just an excellent choice for the Fed vice chair and I think his confirmation, you know, will go thread fairly soon.</p><p>So, we all know the President and his tendency to tweet one something or speak about something or complain about something. And maybe that's just because -- it's just the second time he's done this. It's not the normal protocol, but I don't think it influences Fed policy. But anything, the Fed may be more inclined to take a marginal action to raise rates.</p><p>And I don't think the decision to raise rates this year in September, December, you know, or even close decision. So I think two more rate hikes and we'll see by December the Fed policy was influenced.</p><p>KEENE: The team around him, David Malpass who you worked with for years at Bear Sterns. Mr. Kudlow and others, Secretary Mnuchin, did they have a voice to staunch the President's intentions whether someone politically sees them as good or bad?</p><p>RYDING: Well, they obviously have a voice. But, you know, we do have a President who at times can lash out or say things and there are also competing voices and obviously, you know, the biggest area of that is in the trade area where you've got, you know, Peter Navarro on one side of very protectionist trade agenda and Larry Kudlow with, you know, remains a free market guy. But he knows there a lot of, you know, China in particular being not a good actor on foreign policy --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Right, John?</p><p>RYDING: -- tariffs and free trade, you know, the President's taking actions against that.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. And John, for the moment, the President and his administration think that they're winning the trade war. Will China make them pay for it? Will they make them pay for it next to or closer to the midterm elections? And what would that do to big block buster U.S. companies?</p><p>RYDING: Well, Francine, nobody wins in a trade war. I think, you know, one of the almost universe if (ph) we propositions amongst most economists are the, you know, trade war's tariffs, they are welfare reducing on all sides.</p><p>So, it's not that I think that President Trump is a protectionist, it's that he thinks that tariffs because China has much larger exports to the U.S versus U.S. exports to China has more to lose. And therefore, by taking action and bringing them to the table and try and make progress in the same way that we had the start of a dialogue with the E.U.</p><p>So, I think if isn't trade war, it's not just the U.S. that pays. It's China that pays and we have to see how this plays out. I can't say I'm comfortable with it, but it's not that, you know, China can unilaterally damage the U.S. It would damage itself in the process.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, Gideon, do you think the U.S. cares?</p><p>GIDEON ROSE, CHIEF EDITOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS: So, I go with everything John just said, except the President not being a protectionist. And from -- as a social scientist, what I find absolutely fascinating about the situation is I cannot remember a previous era in which we all sat around trying to predict what the government of the United States would do when the President of the United States, is it war with his own administration.</p><p>So we have no real models are precedent for understanding what happens when the government administration, the deep state, everything goes on and does its basic stuff as John was just talking about, the professional technocrats do their stuff, but then the guy at the top of the whole system who supposedly running things for the benefit of the country and the world and in sequence coordinating all the stuff goes off on a completely separate path and undermines his own administration actions.</p><p>Whether it's in the justice department, or whether it's in the economic policy department or whether it's in the security department. And so, we actually end up doing what John just said which is discounting the President's words, but then trying to figure what actually is going to be U.S. policy. So, we don't know.</p><p>KEENE: Right, I'll just tell you on this book here in a bit on the World War Web with Gideon Rose. It may be the issue ever for them. But right here, I'm going to hold this up, the unrestrained presidency within Gideon Rose's new effort. And within that on IR, but it can be on John's economics as well, the unconstrained presidencies because the legislatures is given up. Where is the legislature to push back against this debate on Fed independence?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so --</p><p>KEENE: Still nowhere.</p><p>ROSE: So, essentially, everything in U.S. politics has become subject to a partisan lens, right. You have Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans have aligned themselves at this point completely with the President who's is the head of their party of the leader office, and essentially now there is no Republican Party except on something, it's essentially Trump. And what Trump -- but he can't do anything.</p><p>So the question is, where does the President focus his attention in his discretionary powers? And then what happens with the rest of the government when they're doing the Donald Reagan cleaning up after the elephant phase? How does that all play out and what is the net result? We don't know.</p><p>KEENE: Lots tot talk about here with John Riding and Gideon Rose. This is an important segment on the World War Web here in a bit.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us of RDQ Economics. John, how many times has the Fed raised rates? Help the President here. You mentioned two rates earlier, but how many times do they raise rates through 2019? Were there?</p><p>RYDING: I think another four times in 2019. I mean --</p><p>KEENE: Two plus four equals six.</p><p>RYDING: Well, yes, two in 2000 and the rest of 2018 and four next year. I mean, look behind, you've got a charts on the real Fed funds rate if I'm looking at your wall correctly. And that's still negative which means to say that the inflation rate's still higher than the short-term interest rate. And that's normally consistent with accommodated conditions.</p><p>The equity market is within half a percent of record high. I don't see where we've had any tightening, reduced accommodation by the Fed with the rate hike so far.</p><p>KEENE: You have been the leading voice in market economics on the idea that higher rates is a good signal for this American economy. Can you say that right now with the debt that's coming on, the deficits that's coming on?</p><p>RYDING: Look, absolutely. I mean, you know, on the one hand and you had guest in your previous how you were talking about the yield curve and the flattening of the yield curve. You know, long term interest rates still remain very low. And monetary policy isn't about conducting interest rate policy to keep the cost of servicing the debt down.</p><p>Monetary policy is about maintaining stable prices and full employment as the Fed's mandated to and it's actually doing a pretty good job of doing that. But long-term, if inflations were to get out of hand and long term interest rates were to go up, that would be a lot more damaging for funding costs from the U.S. debt than the Fed rate hikes.</p><p>LACQUA: John, do you worry about where the U.S. economy is in, you know, the cycle effect, that late cycle and that there's a huge divergence with what, you know, BOJ are doing, ECB is doing?</p><p>RYDING: Well, in terms of where we are in the cycle, I was a lot more worried in 2016. In 2016, we're seeing a macroeconomic profit squeeze in the U.S. of the kind of magnitude that signaled a potential recession problem ahead. That's a far more important signal to me than the yield curve.</p><p>We had the corporate tax sculptures (ph) and reforms are absolutely essential for reinvigorating corporate America. And now we've seen pre- text macro-profit margins widen.</p><p>Now, that may be a problem down the road with inflation. And productivity of growth rates are too low, but in some ways with the way the stock markets moving, with the way it looks like corporate profits are shaping up in the second quarter, it may be that we had a growth recession in 2015, 2016 and we may be coming out of that with stronger growth. The problem is how much slack this was we saw the life in the labor market at a 3.9 percent unemployment rate?</p><p>But so I've been surprised at how many people we have drawn in. And now, it does seem that the U.S. economy is bring in people, more marginal people in terms of education and so on into labor force for a while.</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us who will return in the next half hour on the Central Bank.</p><p>Coming up, Gideon Rose will talk about the Web, look later today on Bloomberg Surveillance on Tesla, on governance. John Coffee, Professor Coffee of course with Columbia. This is Bloomberg, stay with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Let's get back to Gideon Rose of Foreign Affairs and John Ryding of RDQ Economics. John, when you look at China, I just don't believe there's not a slow down. I guess the question is how the authorities deal with it. It's by stimulating the economy so they stabilize it.</p><p>RYDING: Well, the angst say slow down from what rates. So China has been growing 6.5, seven percent at least in their efficient numbers. And if you project that out on compound growth rates and that kind of growth rate cannot be sustainable over a multi-decade period. The China has to slow eventually to the more normal global growth rate as China runs out of the ability to move population from the agricultural sector into the industrial sector.</p><p>So, I think we get too hung up on what China is growing at 6.7 percent or 6.5 percent or, you know, the reality is what China needs to reorientate scope (ph) economy away from being a primarily investment economy to more of a consumer economy. And that might end up being a healthier growth rate and development for the global economy then China simply growing at a faster pace with undertaking a lot of directed investments.</p><p>LACQUA: Gideon, how would you view Chinese politics right now and how bad it actually impacts the economy? If you can you hear me? Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE: All right, a second, I can't hear you.</p><p>LACQUA: No, no one can hear me. Tom, translate for me.</p><p>KEENE: Well, we've got some audio problems going on right now. I mean, I look into the China and I look the -- well, we've got some on (ph) and we'll talk to Francine I guess is what we're going to do here across the transatlantic.</p><p>LACQUA: Can you hear me?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, I can hear you now Francine, sorry about that.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, I'm also hearing myself in Dolby stereo. Gideon, I was asking about Chinese politics and how Chinese politics actually influences the economy.</p><p>ROSE: So, it's actually a great question because what the Chinese actually understand I think far better than their Anglo-American counterparts is that the growth rates and the economic dynamism of the society and the progress toward on economic matters is situated within a political and social context. And so, what the Chinese government is trying to do is not just manage its growth rate and its economic policy, but also manage the entire polity of China in order to preserve the leadership of Xi Jinping and preserve stability within China and increase Chinese power.</p><p>And that broader context is actually really important because that's the kind of attention, not just to economic policy alone, but to the broader context of economics, society, and politics that economic policy makers in the west have basically intended to lose sight of which is producing a system in which there's a lot of push back and turmoil and people are getting that response (ph).</p><p>KEENE: We're going to have to leave it there. We'll get our audio straighten now and we thank you for being with us. With John Riding and Gideon Rose, please stay with us, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: With us is Gideon Rose, he is of course the Editor in Chief of Foreign Affairs. Gideon, congratulations on this. Let me get right to it. The internet has lost its promise. Discuss.</p><p>ROSE: So, thank you very much for your kind words about the issue. Basically, think of this as a four at play. In the first act, the United States government creates the fundamentals of what we'll now call the internet.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>ROSE: The communication's network and a bunch of corporate (ph) of stuff - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSE: In act two, the United States government pairs with and partners with the private sector to develop this. It makes the infrastructure generally public and then allows private sector actors to develop all sorts of applications and so forth. This is the golden age of the internet in 1990's and things like that.</p><p>Act three, this starts to fray because the system goes on autopilot. And what happens is the large private tech companies take over large portions of the internet and become a sort of oligopoly running things on their own, government regulators really don't really get involved and the interne takes on its own life.</p><p>And during chapter three, the act three, various people start to push back against the problems with the internet. The Chinese try to succeed in a cyber sovereignty in their own sphere. The Europeans try to do regulations with GDPR. The Indians try to build a new internet from the ground up on more populist public good basis. And the Americans sit around wondering, can we control the tech companies? But Americans are so embedded in an Anglo-American view of liberal capitalism in which the government lets the private sector do its stuff that American policy has allowed the internet to create problems and now other people are stepping in to fix those problems.</p><p>KEENE: You really explained, then who has the power here? As you go chapter by chapter brilliantly, is it shining with the power or is it European regulatory structure that has --</p><p>ROSE: So the great question is we don't know who's going to have the power in act four. Because what happened in act one and two was the U.S. government created the infrastructure and turned it over to the private sector to help run. And in act three, we end up getting a lot of push back. And right now, you have governments like China, you have regional regulators like those in Europe, you have private sector companies like big tech, you have the citizens in general and nobody knows who is going to control the commanding heights of the digital economy.</p><p>Like for example, data regulation, who is going to get to keep and control and monetize the data? The individuals? The companies? The governments?</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but this is (INAUDIBLE). You mentioned commanding heights which is of course Daniel Yergin in his classic book on the 90s on the 20th century. Capitalism, there were two wars in the middle of Dan Yergin's commanding heights. What's going to be the warfare equivalent of this technology in our society?</p><p>ROSE: So, it's not going to be warfare in terms of geopolitical conflict between the major powers. What's going to happen is there was a common American sponsored liberal open order of the internet. Somewhat parallel to the globalization order and American officials move that forward to get all the benefits, but they forgot that the destruction part of created destruction creates pushback and people resist. And what you're seeing now in China, in Europe, in India even in the U.S. is people reacting against an unfettered private sector dominated internet but no one knows how to reestablish control because you don't want kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs.</p><p>So, what's happening right now is the question over the future control of the internet. It's not necessarily just going to be what it was in the last couple of decades which is, the United States debating whether or not to allow tech companies to have control over things.</p><p>Now, other global players are in fact going to be an important to this.</p><p>KEENE: Then how do you respond to the news just in the last 24 hours Apple limit x number of apps to China. I mean with their new chapter on China, they're making the rules, we're not. And even Tim Cook, Chief Operating officer of Tesla down Tim Cook has to vow to China.</p><p>ROSE: So what I feel about this is it's a little bit like the economic nationalism in other areas that we're seeing, right. Globalization races forward, it produces lots of wonderful things, lots of creative destruction and turmoil, but it also produces pushback and problems for people inside major developed western countries which causes them to want to put breaks in the process.</p><p>Take -- the fact is the Chinese are doing the same thing with the internet and just like American economic nationalist and populists and British wants and up places elsewhere want to hide off their economies from the globe and establish sovereignty, so the Chinese are trying to do the same thing for the internet.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, but we're talking about the different things, right. Gideon, on the one side, it's like cybersecurity and I guess, you know, the cyber race on who will have supremacy between China and the U.S. The other one is simply who is in the third act. It could be regulators, right. And this is Europe. Europe is leading a forefront regulation on automated (ph) passes pushback against it, but when it comes to data protection, these are the new people in town.</p><p>ROSE: Yes, but it's actually there are several competitors trying to do the same thing and we don't know which way of controlling the problems is going to win out. The European approach is regulation for the whole system, OK. The Chinese approaches secession from the system. Cyber sovereignty eventually the goal of that is to create essentially a splinternet in which there's a general public internet but the Chinese have build their own platforms, their own systems in 20 years in effect it'll be much more of a Chinese dominated internet than American dominated one.</p><p>The Indians want to reengineer the whole thing from the ground up. Fascinating article by Nandan Nilekani from emphasis abut what the Indians are doing in internet policy, maybe the most impressive and interesting of all the different approaches even though we don't hear much about it. And basically United States we're still wondering what to do because we don't basically have the conceptual ability to direct companies the way the government wants. And so, for the public ones.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Talk to me about regulation because there's a great article in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs written by Helen Dixon saying regulate to liberate, can Europe save the internet? Can it?</p><p>ROSE: Well, so this is the great question. We tried to present a fair picture of this whole big debate. It's going forward on the future. So the lead piece in the package is by Adam Siegel talking about the transition of power from United States to China. Helen Dixon's article expresses the European approach which is no, it doesn't have to be the U.S. approach or the Chinese separate one, we can regulate it. Nandan Nilekani talks about the Indian one. We also have a number of different pieces on specific challenges of cyber security.</p><p>You should look at the European approach, the Chinese approach, the Indian approach and the American approach as variance of the same thing. Now that we've unleashed the wonderful creative destruction of digital technology, how do we keep it going forward in a positive way while controlling the social and political effects of all of this creative destruction?</p><p>LACQUA: Would these nations ever come together, Gideon? I don't know if whether it's a plaza accord for the internet. But, you know, that's the kind of idea.</p><p>ROSE: So, if people like John Ryding were controlling this stuff, then the answer would be yes because there's an obvious benefit for people to come together in a collective action coordination solution to read the benefits of a coordinated policy with central regulation.</p><p>But the problem is right now we have a tied international politics in the United States and elsewhere which is going inward rather than collective and I think the answer is we're moving towards a splinternet more than we are towards a new revelation.</p><p>KEENE: I love -- can we steal that words splinternet you get a royalty on that.</p><p>ROSE: It's not mine but it's a favorite --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE: Here's the New York Times today folks, I'll read it for you. Russian hackers broaden the tax to consumers. First of all, I've got to make some news here with the counsel and foreign relations hack by Russians as well in this article?</p><p>ROSE: Like everybody else, we're constantly fished and attacked by various different actors. But that's just -- the Russians don't bother me as much. The Russians are like Butch Cassidy on the Sundance kid harassing the railroad.</p><p>KEENE: OK, who's the Katherine Losse (ph) of the World War Web? That's a Butch Cassidy.</p><p>ROSE: If the Chinese were going to be building a whole new railroad. So, we're worrying like E.H. Harriman in the Union percent (ph) of railroad about who's stealing our little -- we're worrying about who's stealing our safe. The Chinese are going around buying up the land and wanting them changed and developing engine technology 20 years from now, we're going to be running on Chinese trains and we're going to be wondering how did that happened.</p><p>KEENE: OK, then what is -- Francine's wonderful question about how do we get together on this, where is the unifying force particularly given the fractious politics our president's having with our allies?</p><p>ROSE: Karen Lornbluh and Michele Flournoy and Michael Somare have pieces in the article, in the package telling you what the United States should do and there are a lot of things.</p><p>Again, I would look to the Indian approach of the internet as a public good that may hold the best solution down the long road.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, but Tim Cook's stock options is not the public good.</p><p>ROSE: The question of the regulation of capitalism in a way that is beneficial economically, but also sustainable politically and socially is going to be that question of the mid 21st century.</p><p>LACQUA: Gideon, do you think any of these companies would self regulate for real?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, just like Martin Shkreli will self regulate.</p><p>LACQUA: It's respectively look?</p><p>ROSE: Yes, we can count on the tech companies to self regulate just like we can count on the pharmaceutical companies to provide low-cost medicines for everybody without regard to jacking up things when they have a cash monopoly like it ever been (ph).</p><p>LACQUA: All right, perfect. So, we do a little bit of, you know, that's a no. But why not? If you listen to the rationale of them regulating, it's either you regulate or you don't survive as people stop using you because you don't, you know, they don't trust. This -- they make money out of trusts, they don't make money out of selling drugs.</p><p>ROSE: Yes, in the long run. And in the short run, you make money by increasing your share of things, right. We have a president right now who is ignoring the entire cost of a global trade war to get some short term minor advantage in trivial little issues.</p><p>So, that kind of thinking if it can apply to the president of United States and the entire Republican Party, it also applies to individual private sector company managers. So we can't rely on them to be responsible for the entire global community down the road.</p><p>KEENE: Gideon, thank you so much. Your most important issue, I really mean this folks how dumb I am on our World War Web and I've to read it cover to cover. I can't say enough about it.</p><p>We're going to come back. John Ryding of RDQ Economics to dive once more into the independence of your selected central bank and then an important conversation with Gerard Cassidy on Fortress diamond, Fortress Moynihan in your neighborhood bank.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: John Ryding with us with RDQ Economics and Gerard Cassidy joins from RBC Capital Markets and both of them have leaved every moment of this crisis. John, let me start with you as you go back and you look at where we are, can you say we're out of the crisis and it's a distant memory?</p><p>RYDING: We're out of the crisis and unfortunately it's a distant memory because by -- it become a distant memory, it's the way that some of the mistakes we make. But the difference between now and then is the degree of bank capital.</p><p>I think the system is much better buffered ad that's a positive. I think the unfortunate thing is in the re-regulation phase, some of the powers of the Fed intervened have been diminished sort of length of last resort which in the end is key when we get enterprises those -- some of those length of last resort facilities that powers been clipped.</p><p>But, yes, it's 10 years on, banks are well capitalized and this is when we make the mistakes that sow the seeds for the next problems.</p><p>KEENE: And Former Fed Official and Economist John Ryder, now we go to the trenches of securities analysis here. Do you agree that our banks are stronger and more resilient to the surprises that can come from 2006 and on to 2007?</p><p>GERARD CASSIDY, HEAD OF U.S. BANK EQUITY STRATEGY, RBC: Absolutely Tom, what we've seen the banking industry has been recapitalized quite romantically. We haven't seen levels of capital like this in decades.</p><p>I would also point out what the Federal Reserve did though was they pushed the risk outside the commercial banking system. It is now in the shadow of banking industry. That's where the risk lies.</p><p>So when the next crisis comes, we're not going to JPMorgan or Bank of America or Citigroup have the problems that they had last time. But I do worry about the hedge funds, the mutual funds, all the other outside, the traditional-commercial banking industry, those are the folks that could have the real problems.</p><p>LACQUA: John, where do you think the next crisis will come from? Is it going to be from Asia, is it going to be away from the financial sector?</p><p>RYDING: Well, I think in all things, the source of the crisis suppose to what the crisis is becomes financial policy, monetary policy that's too lose. I still think we have lax monetary policy that leads to over leverage, that leads to capital flow into asset classes that it shouldn't be.</p><p>But the system is being tested. What's happening in Turkey and the global ramifications, that's an interesting test because we thought emerging markets is one area that's going to be overleveraged. But, I don't see that so much as a systemic issue in the same way that (INAUDIBLE) turned out to be systemic issue back in 2010.</p><p>So, capital is an important buffer to hold back those crises. But raising interest rates is the best way to avoid getting into it.</p><p>KEENE: It's exceptionally time with John Ryding, thank you so much for being with us today. John Ryding on Fed independence, he's with RDQ economics. Coming up, a really important chart with Gerard Cassidy, we'll that next. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: It's just a simple chart with Gerard Cassidy to look at here. And Gerard, what I want to talk about, forget about the Bull market like Fortress Diamond and maybe back here is a Harris and like here's a great malaise. How does any bank institution avoid a 15 year churn? What do you do to avoid that?</p><p>CASSIDY: Tom, I think that this is a phenomenal chart to have a go back as far as you have it and you do show the two great up legs. But there is that period that you point out this malaise. I think what it is, today, the banks are more focused than ever on shareholder return. During that malaise period, it was the recovery coming out of the 1990 downturn, but then you had the tech implosion in 2001. So those two periods affected the malaise that you identified.</p><p>KEENE: Who into -- your universe and even bank on the cover, I understand the game. Who is the one that uses technology best? Who's the technological leader in the Cassidy world?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say that you have to identify probably our top banks, including bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Citigroup I would put in there as well. So, our biggest banks are not only spending the most money, they are also becoming the most tech savvy. They're embracing it. They know the digitalization of banking is the future.</p><p>LACQUA: Gerard, are there concerns that actually some like Facebook or Amazon or someone else will go into banking?</p><p>CASSIDY: I would say that we don't really have to worry about that at this time. And the reason being there was a large moat around commercial banking. If you want to take the deposits and make loans, you have to have a banking license. I'm not -- I don't believe that Facebook, Google, or any of these companies want to become a bank holding company because you will be regulated by the bank regulators which would then lead to a much lower stock multiple. So right now, the moat is very difficult if impossible to cross.</p><p>LACQUA: We love talking about banks. We talk about capital ratios, we talk about you know, the thick (ph) and all of that, but actually who's the bank that's talking to millenials and is that the next frontier?</p><p>CASSIDY: You know, it's interesting because the millenials are a very important part of the banking system and all the banks are trying to reach out with to them.</p><p>I was with U.S. bank core yesterday in Boston and it was very clear to me that this company is reaching out and through their payment system, to millennials because think of Venmo or Uber, that's the first introduction many of these millenials have to the banking system is through payments where many of us, Tom and I and folks first time we ever got in touch with the bank was with the passbook savings account. That's not the way in many of millenials do it anymore.</p><p>So, I would say the big banks JPMorgan and Bank of America, Regional Banks like PMC and U.S. bank are doing very good job reaching out to the millenials.</p><p>KEENE: Work very quickly here, when does branch banking finally throw in the towel? tail? I mean you go buy and nobody is them.</p><p>CASSIDY: Tom, it's amazing what's happening.</p><p>KEENE: It is amazing.</p><p>CASSIDY: It truly is. And we have some data to show you that the branch banking peak, the year the Apple introduced the iPhone. So, over the next ten years I would suggest to you but probably there was another third of the branches easily.</p><p>KEENE: A third, very good. Gerard Cassidy thank you so much and we'll continue this discussion. I'm thrilled to say with Mr. Ferro on Bloomberg Radio here in a moment.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

La audiencia de las m\u00e1ximas autoridades de Google, Apple, Amazon y Facebook frente al Comit\u00e9 de Competencia de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes se da en el contexto de investigaciones acerca de c\u00f3mo ellas -conocidas como las \"Big Tech\"- podr\u00edan estar desarrollando conductas anticompetitivas en los mercados.<br/>La discusi\u00f3n acerca de estas empresas es consecuencia del tama\u00f1o que han alcanzado, as\u00ed como de la naturaleza de sus negocios. Ellas basan su modelo en econom\u00edas de red, donde el mayor alcance en t\u00e9rminos de consumidores y proveedores favorece su posici\u00f3n competitiva, al tiempo que les permite desarrollar ventajas de costos. Esta tensi\u00f3n, presente en varias industrias, se observa con claridad en aquellas ligadas a la econom\u00eda digital, en que el manejo de datos y el acceso a millones de clientes constituyen uno de los elementos diferenciadores m\u00e1s importantes frente a la competencia. As\u00ed, una vez alcanzada cierta escala, podr\u00edan tener un comportamiento monop\u00f3lico.<br/>El debate regulatorio en esta materia es creciente, pero todav\u00eda los acad\u00e9micos y los gobiernos est\u00e1n ideando estrategias \u00f3ptimas. En parte, la dificultad se debe a que en este tipo de negocios el referido componente de econom\u00edas de red es muy sustantivo, dificultando la coexistencia de alternativas. Por ello, el esfuerzo competitivo debe estar puesto en mantener viva la capacidad de desafiar a las empresas existentes, evitando la introducci\u00f3n de barreras a la entrada. Especial importancia tiene el manejo de datos: parte de su ventaja competitiva -y quiz\u00e1 el coraz\u00f3n de su modelo de negocios- radica en el acceso a miles de millones de datos y transacciones, que permite conocer el comportamiento de las personas y con ello ofrecer servicios atractivos.<br/>Pero la dimensi\u00f3n de competencia no es el \u00fanico aspecto a resaltar de la relaci\u00f3n entre los gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos, las personas y el Estado. Como muestra la presentaci\u00f3n ante el Congreso, el manejo de los datos y la capacidad de afectar las comunicaciones y la democracia, los debates en torno a la censura y los aspectos geopol\u00edticos que el poder\u00edo tecnol\u00f3gico conlleva son temas centrales. De hecho, una parte de la disputa entre China y Estados Unidos dice relaci\u00f3n con la ventaja que el control de empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas y de datos provee.<br/>La capacidad de censurar comunicaciones, influir en la informaci\u00f3n a la que tienen acceso las personas o distribuirla a los usuarios de acuerdo con criterios desconocidos son dimensiones que subyacen a su quehacer. Por ello, en lo venidero, tanto la discusi\u00f3n estrictamente competitiva como el dominio sobre la informaci\u00f3n y la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica ser\u00e1n los aspectos decisivos en la din\u00e1mica de estas industrias.<br/>Copyright Grupo de Diarios Am\u00e9rica - GDA/El Mercurio/Chile<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EMERCH-4185812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EMERCH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-92K1-DY1R-B4CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323549</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 El Mercurio, Chile Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>El Mercurio (Chile)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>2 agosto 2020 domingo</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>empresas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> debate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> datos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> acceso</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Gigantes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> red</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> modelo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> banquillo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> capacidad</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008ZHS</classCode><className>Information Management + Technology</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

There are efforts in several countries in Europe to reclassify drivers as employees, including the UK, where an appeals court ruled in favour of employment status, pushing the final say to the top court.</p><p>Taken together, the moves show that a decade after companies like Uber rocketed to popularity by offering low-cost, on-demand services, governments are pushing back, demanding many of the same labour protections and other regulatory requ-irements the companies avoided in devising their business models.</p><p>When Uber and other gig-based companies like TaskRabbit started, consumers were initially delighted by the convenience and novelty. Their employment model - independent contractors aren't necessarily paid by the hour and don't have benefits like health insurance or unemployment insurance - helped the companies stay nimble and undercut incumbents like taxis that can be burdened by city pay regulations.</p><p>Workers could drop in and out as they liked. But as the services have grown and become ubiquitous, complaints have increased.</p><p>At the moment when Big Tech began losing its lustre in Washington, the novelty factor of the ride-hailing companies began to dissipate. Even as the services still enjoy broad popularity with consumers, constituent complaints in cities and states began piling up over some of their effects like congested streets and low driver pay.</p><p>\"A lot of that shininess has worn off,\" said Meera Joshi, who headed the agency that regulates ride-hailing and taxis in New York City and oversaw the minimum-wage requirement for Uber and Lyft.</p><p>\"You see the same identical recurring issues around the world - they're around congestion, driver pay environmental impact,\" she added. \"In New York, a lot of this happened quicker.\" Given the growth of the sector - Lyft alone has said more than two million people drove for it at some point in 2018, or more than 1\"per cent of the US workforce - other cities and states are expected to follow.</p><p>\"California is not happening in a vacuum,\" said Bradley Tusk, a political consultant and venture capitalist whose Tusk Ventures was an early investor in Uber.</p><p>\"The politics in state government right now is trending left,\" a problem for the companies given that Democrats have been pushing added labour regulations on tech, he said.</p><p>The moves threaten to add significant costs for the gig economy, which extends beyond Uber and Lyft to a host of delivery companies like DoorDash and Instacart, whose delivery bikes and cars now dot urban streets around the globe. Almost none of these companies is profitable, and Uber and Lyft in particular haven't identified clear paths to profitability.</p><p>Their stocks have struggled since their market debuts this spring. Uber has fallen nearly 25\"per cent since its IPO, and Lyft is down around 35 per cent. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate Uber and Lyft's California driver costs could go up 35 per cent.</p><p>The companies have said that measures like California's aren't what most drivers want. Economics will force them to change their business models and decrease worker flexibility if drivers are classified as employees, they say.</p><p>Still, both companies say they will continue to work with governments. A Lyft spokesman said the company has long \"worked with regulators to find solutions that benefit drivers and riders and support innovation\".</p><p>Uber, Lyft and other firms including DoorDash are still pushing for a deal that would exempt them - one in which they would offer concessions like a benefits fund and a measure that gives drivers the ability to collectively negotiate with several employers.Should that fail, they plan to look to voters. The three companies promised earlier this month to spend at least $US90 million combined to fund a ballot initiative to reverse the effects of the bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-56d2b83ad76c11e98857446d2f66fe56cdf882e718a5d29bd7eae98658d46744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X29-7FN1-JD3N-51FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

(GILD), the third largest biotechnology stock on the U.S. exchanges, may have completed a multi-year bottoming pattern, setting the stage for an uptrend that could reach the lofty heights posted in the middle of the last decade. That's good news for long-suffering shareholders as well as blue-chip biotech investors who have watched their portfolios underperform broad benchmarks in recent years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Similar stories are playing out across the market landscape, with iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund ETF (IBB) now perfectly positioned to mount 2019 resistance and head toward the all-time high posted in July 2015. This is unexpected, to say the least, in an election year that will shine an unfavorable spotlight on the pharmaceutical industry and its pricing practices. It's entirely possible that investors are already looking past November, expecting a second Trump administration to back away from new regulations.</p><p>Gilead Sciences came public at a split-adjusted 69 cents in 1992 and entered a downtrend that posted an all-time low at 20 cents in 1994. The subsequent uptick reached a new high in 1995, underpinning an uptrend that eased into a rising channel in 1999. The rally was unaffected when the internet bubble broke one year later, continuing to post steady gains within the channel into July 2008, when it topped out at in the upper $20s.</p><p>The stock posted a 38% decline during the economic collapse but failed to bounce into the new decade, unlike the majority of the recovering stock universe. It broke the 2008 low in 2010, finding support in the mid-teens, and tested that level successfully 13 months later. This bullish action completed a double bottom reversal, establishing an uptrend that attracted intense momentum buying interest in 2013.</p><p>The rally posted exceptional gains into the end of 2014, topping out at $117 and failing a breakout attempt above that level in 2015. Aggressive bears then took control, carving a decline that cut the stock's price in half into the 2017 low at $63.76. The subsequent bounce failed in early 2018, yielding a final sell-off that undercut the 2017 low in December. The stock has been testing that level for more than a year while the long-term pattern has carved a massive double bottom.</p><p>Price action reached 50-month exponential moving average (EMA) resistance for the first time since October 2018 last week, triggering a reversal, but an uptick in buying volume suggests a successful assault on this barrier in coming weeks. That event would set off preliminary buying signals, but it could be months or longer before the stock catches the undivided attention of Wall Street analysts and investors now chasing FAANG and other big tech stocks.</p><p>The on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator entered an accumulation phase in June 2017 and just reached the level posted when the stock topped out in 2014. This volume activity is generating a major bullish divergence, predicting that price will play catch-up in coming months. An OBV uptick above the red line would be especially bullish, indicating that institutions are quietly loading up on shares in anticipation of higher prices.</p><p>The rally into February mounted the 200-day EMA between $65 and $66, marking a price level that needs to be held at all costs because the stock has failed the past seven attempts to clear this barrier. As a result, there's considerable risk in buying the current pullback, but a bounce that exceeds the Feb. 7 high at $71 should generate rapid upside into the October 2018 high near $80 and finally lift the slumping monthly stochastic oscillator into a sustained buy cycle.</p><p>The Bottom Line</p><p>Chronic laggard Gilead Sciences may enter a new uptrend in coming months, catching the majority of market players by surprise. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHARMO-167484688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHARMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7B-0FN1-F11P-X4NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428557</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point.

An OBV uptick above the red line would be especially bullish, indicating that institutions are quietly loading up on shares in anticipation of higher prices.The rally into February mounted the 200-day EMA between $65 and $66, marking a price level that needs to be held at all costs because the stock has failed the past seven attempts to clear this barrier. As a result, there's considerable risk in buying the current pullback[13], but a bounce that exceeds the Feb. 7 high at $71 should generate rapid upside into the October 2018 high near $80 and finally lift the slumping monthly stochastic oscillator[14] into a sustained buy cycle. The Bottom Line  Chronic laggard Gilead Sciences may enter a new uptrend in coming months, catching the majority of market players by surprise.Disclosure: The author held no positions in the aforementioned securities at the time of publication.

INTRODUCTION</p><p>The \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's\" (TCJA) international provisions have been a source of confusion and criticism in both the United States and in Europe. Early reactions to the law and its international provisions have highlighted technical issues, (1) potential violations of international agreements, (2) and purported adverse effects. (3) The tax policy debate on the merits of TCJA and its international provisions has just begun. At the same time, U.S. political discourse regarding international taxation has shifted from debating the merits of the TCJA to defending U.S. firms against the threat of unilateral \"digital\" taxation. (4) In Europe, the TCJA is increasingly a source of inspiration and consternation as countries grapple with how to reform international tax rules for a digital age. (5)</p><p>Many EU member states have expressed heightened interest in international taxation through the prism of \"digital\" taxation. (6) While the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project is wrapping up, BEPS's capstone \"Digital Economy\" action item remains a final initiative. (7) Current OECD and EU responses to the \"digital\" economy in BEPS and through unilateral measures mark the culmination of an almost decade long effort to plug loopholes in international tax regimes designed for a pre-digital age. (8) But will multilateral action on \"digital\" taxation come quickly enough? Some countries such as the United Kingdom and France seem unwilling to wait for multilateral action, unleashing a political and tax policy maelstrom befitting the digital age. (9)</p><p>Confronting the current upheaval in international tax policy, how does the TCJA's Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provision--a global minimum tax on excess profits--fit into the larger debate about international tax avoidance, \"harmful\" tax competition, and taxation of the \"digital\" economy? (10) Far from rolling in a U.S. Trojan horse, GILTI offers developed resident economies (particularly EU member states) a critical tax instrument to combat base erosion and profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. (11) As a residence-based global minimum tax, GILTI is a tax tool \"Made in America\" for European tax.</p><p>GILTI does for profit shifting and base erosion what FATCA did for financial information exchange and tax evasion. (12) GILTI provides a globally significant baseline around which other countries can implement defensive tax measures for resident firms. The OECD and EU might bemoan GILTI's unilateral character. (13) But behind the boogeyman of arrogant American unilateralism, GILTI stands out as a critical tax tool for countries wishing to foster beneficial competition on productive economic factors and efficiencies. (14) Notwithstanding empty ideological appeals to multilateralism from multinational bodies like the OECD, global cooperation is not inherently in tension with unilateral sovereign conduct. (15) As with FATCA, the \"Made in America\" medicine might be distasteful to EU member states inclined towards multilateral efforts built on consensus building. Yet the United States' ability to facilitate cooperative multi-state action through a unilateral strategy with cooperative potential is precisely what gives GILTI its potency. (16) For countries seeking to protect and recoup government subsidies for innovation, GILTI's medicine is far superior to the disease of veiled and ineffectual multilateralism on display in BEPS' empty attempts to \"combat\" harmful tax competition. (17)</p><p>Rather than perpetuate trans-Atlantic hostilities while Europe and the OECD consider the \"digital\" economy, the U.S. tax and business communities must explain how GILTI promotes beneficial competition on productive economic factors, discourages base erosion and profit shifting by U.S. multinationals (MNEs), and provides cover for other countries to modernize international tax rules consistent with longstanding principles of tax territoriality. (18) Political developments in the European Union and OECD suggest that EU member states need not feel guilty about leveraging a GILTI-esque minimum tax tool to combat the challenging issues facing international taxation in the digital age. (19) Indeed, Germany and France have proposed a GILTI-esque minimum tax as part of a multilateral OECD proposal to confront challenges in taxing the \"digital economy\"--\"a kind of BEPS 2.0\" that utilizes U.S. unilateral action to facilitate international cooperation in combatting tax avoidance. (20)</p><p>At the heart of the controversy over GILTI, \"Digital Taxation,\" and the larger BEPS project is a debate about the propriety and benefits of tax competition. While tax competition is a controversial concept among economists and tax lawyers, (21) recent scholarship provides a framework to talk productively about tax competition. (22) This paper draws on the theory of tax competition and language of international tax neutrality to argue that international tax policy must be viewed through the lens of \"national welfare\" when considering strategic incentives and, thus, positive predictions about nation state behavior in the international tax competition game. Viewing tax competition and GILTI's global minimum tax through the prism of game theory yields important insights into the potential of unilateral U.S. action to alleviate global collective action problems.</p><p>An important question in evaluating GILTI is whether it enables potential cooperative behavior among developed economies through signaling and minimum standards by a sovereign with \"pricing\" power to set global rate and base terms for MNEs. In short, is GILTI a harmful unilateral measure that undermines cooperative efforts in the OECD and EU? Or, is GILTI like FATCA-a veiled if unsolicited gift for developed economies? This paper answers these questions and highlights the potential of a global minimum tax on excess profits to promote international tax reform in a digitized economy while retaining foundational principles of tax sovereignty.</p><p>Part II introduces GILTI and the origins of the TCJA's shift to current taxation of excess profits; it also defends GILTI's reliance on intangibles to define excess profits. Part III introduces the EU and OECD's efforts to combat base erosion and profit shifting through multilateral initiatives--like BEPS--as well as the debate about \"digital taxation.\" Part IV introduces theories of tax competition and international tax neutrality benchmarks to establish \"national welfare\" as the appropriate descriptive and normative framework for evaluating international tax policy within a multi-sovereign tax competition game. Part V applies game theory to the tax competition and \"digital taxation\" debates to show how GILTI's resident based global minimum tax liberates developed economies to compete on productive factors and combat base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p>II. A STATESIDE VIEW: GILTI'S ORIGINS &amp; RELIANCE ON \"INTANGIBLES\" AS EXCESS PROFITS</p><p>A. Origins of U.S. Taxation of Excess Profits (GILTI)</p><p>The TCJA moved the U.S. international tax systems away from a worldwide regime with limited foreign credits and unlimited deferral of foreign income to a territorial regime with current taxation of excess profits. The U.S. system has always operated along a worldwide/territorial spectrum. The \"hybrid\" character of the U.S. system (exemption with defensive measures or worldwide taxation with deferral and limited crediting) makes it hard to categorize per se, but in general, the TCJA moved the United States closer to the dominant territorial approach taken by OECD nations. (23) From the perspective of global structural harmonization in international taxation, the U.S. move towards territoriality marks some improvement over prior U.S. law. The United States is unique, however, among OECD countries in adopting a worldwide minimum tax on resident shareholders' excess profits.</p><p>The TCJA introduced a minimum tax on foreign derived excess profits (GILTI). (24) Pun surely intended, GILTI is the U.S. resident shareholder global minimum tax on foreign derived excess profits. The ideas of eliminating foreign income deferral and taxing excess profits through a global minimum tax are not new to U.S. tax policy. A resident-based global minimum or excess profits tax was present in proposals from former House Ways and Means Chairman David Camp almost a decade ago. (25) Around the same time, President Obama's corporate tax reform proposals recommended \"treat[ing] as IP income any income that reflects an 'excess return.'\" (26) Indeed, a major theme of President Obama's international tax reform proposal was ending deferral of foreign income and targeting excess profits earned through income shifting to foreign low-tax jurisdictions. (27) One proposal from Chairman Camp even suggested \"combining current U.S. taxation of any CFC's foreign IP income taxed at a foreign effective tax rate less than 13.5% with a patent box at a 15% rate for all foreign intangible income of a domestic corporation (including royalties).\" (28) Sound familiar? Utilizing a metaphor used to describe the GILTI/FDII regime, Chairman Camp \"describe[ed] th[is] alternative as combining 'the carrot of an 'innovation box' and royalty relief with the 'stick' of a current... inclusion for intangibles-related income of CFCs in low-tax jurisdictions.'\" (29)</p><p>Notwithstanding the rushed and opaque legislative process that defined the TCJA, GILTI is not a novel creature from the tax policy lagoon. (30) In fact, GILTI is consistent with prior U.S. reform proposals from across the political spectrum. (31) As one commentator quipped,</p><p>\"there are no new ideas in either fashion or taxation.\" (32) The TCJA's international provisions drew on existing reform proposals for good reason--a global minimum tax was central to prior bipartisan international tax reform proposals. As President Obama argued in 2012 \"no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas... from now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.\" (33)</p><p>A global minimum tax allows sovereigns to recapture resident benefits that enable domestic firms to exploit excess returns in foreign markets. (34) Apple's profits on its newest iPhone are attributable in part to the foreign markets in which the iPhone is manufactured as well as the final location of sale. (35) But as Apple advertises, Apple products are \"Designed by Apple in California.\" (36) In its branding, Apple proudly recognizes the legal, human, and physical infrastructure in California and the United States that allow initial designs and engineering \"in California\" to produce spectacular excess profits around the world. (37) While global profits are properly allocable to an array of jurisdictions based on traditional principles of transferpricing, excess profits belong in the host country that enables \"design\" and innovation through subsidies and direct investment in productive economic factors. Ultimately, resident country sharing in resident firm foreign excess profits promotes beneficial competition among resident economies around productive factors with potential global spillover benefits to non-resident economies.</p><p>B. G1LTI</p><p>Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) is certain income that must be included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder in a</p><p>Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). (38) GILTI is subject to a minimum tax on income that exceeds a presumed \"normal\" ten percent rate of return. GILTI is thus generally subject to a 10.5 percent minimum U.S. tax for income derived from a CFC. Depending on foreign source rates, a limited foreign tax credit renders a variable rate on GILTI from 10.5 to 13.125 percent. (39) Nominally, GILTI applies to \"intangible\" income. By statute, however, intangible income is not in fact income from accounting intangibles. Instead, \"intangible\" income for GILTI purposes is income in excess of a deemed \"normal\" rate of return.</p><p>A U.S. shareholder in a CFC must annually calculate her GILTI. (40) The GILTI income base is the excess of \"net CFC tested income\" over a \"net deemed tangible income return.\" (41) To calculate \"net CFC tested income,\" a U.S. shareholder calculates the excess of (1) the aggregate of her pro rata shares of all her CFCs' \"tested income\" over (2) the aggregate of her pro rata share of all CFC's \"tested losses.\" (42) Basically, \"tested income\" is net income not already subject to U.S. tax and \"tested losses\" is excess allocable income. (43) \"Net deemed tangible income return\" is the excess of (1) 10% of the aggregate of U.S. shareholder pro rata share of \"qualified business asset investment\" (QBAI) of every CFC, over (2) certain interest deducted in arriving at \"tested income.\" (44) QBAI is based on an average (over four quarters) of the CFCs aggregate adjusted basis in 'specified tangible property' that could be depreciable and is used in trade or business of the CFC. (45)</p><p>Specified tangible property is tangible property used to generate tested income. (46)</p><p>If you skipped the prior paragraph, don't feel GILTI. The rule is technically complex. The intuition and objective, however, are simple. GILTI implements a minimum tax on the foreign profits of U.S. CFCs in excess of a deemed \"normal\" return. Because the GILTI base is calculated in relation to 'tangible' specific property, the net GILTI income reflects excess profits in relation to the tangible property used to generate that income. A ten percent rate might seem arbitrary. Some have argued that the deemed 'normal' (ten percent) rate reflects legitimate expectations for returns on tangible investment and, thus, that excess profit is properly attributable to exploitation of intangibles. (47) At the same time, a presumed ten percent rate might not account for high-risk/high-return ventures like pharmaceutical development, which often produces outsized returns in particular years while cross-subsidizing non-profitable but socially beneficial investments. (48) As a tax policy tool, GILTI's deemed rate of return carries the common benefits and drawbacks of a blunt rule. The most obvious benefit is the simplicity of a bright line rule to combat profit shifting. The most obvious drawback is GILTI's potential to incentivize U.S. firms to locate tangible investments in low-tax jurisdictions to soak up low foreign tax rates.</p><p>Once a U.S. firm's GILTI income is determined, additional U.S. tax is attributed to the foreign CFC. (49) If a U.S. shareholder has a GILTI inclusion, it can receive a limited foreign tax credit (FTC) equal to eighty percent that applies to its \"inclusion percentage\" times its \"tested foreign income taxes.\" (50) Basically, the U.S. shareholder receives eighty percent of the foreign tax paid by the CFC reduced by the ratio of excess profits. If a firm has a high ratio of tested income to its tangible asset base (QBAI), the FTC will be reduced in proportion to that amount. Only U.S. domestic corporations are eligible for an FTC on GILTI income. (51)</p><p>C. The Intangible Economics Behind GILTI</p><p>\"America's economy is shifting further towards intangibles\" is the cogent proclamation of The Economist. (52) GILTI relies on a concept of intangibles broadly defined. In contrast to the relatively narrow accounting concept of intangibles, GILTI is predicated on a presumptive \"normal\" (ten percent) rate of return. (53) In reality, GILTI's \"intangibles\" taxation is thus taxation of \"excess profits.\" In economic terminology \"excess profits\" is synonymous with \"rents\"--profits above the rate of return necessary to justify an investment under corporate finance theory. (54) In theory, excess profits in maturing market economies might be expected to result from investment in intangibles. For example, the marginal profitability of foreign investment is limited for many commodity products as global labor and input prices equalize. (55) If firms seek profits in excess of normal rates of return, they need to build a better mousetrap--or better mousetrap production process. Intangibles, in the form of supply chain efficiencies, technical know-how (firm knowledge), and intellectual property are the inputs that allow firms to build a better mouse trap and, thus, earn excess profits at home and abroad. To appreciate the \"intangibles\" twist in GILTI, it is, therefore, essential to understand the rise of an intangibles economy in the developed world. (56)</p><p>Aspects of modern developed economies are sometimes referred to as the \"digital\" economy. (57) Despite the popular emphasis on the digital aspects of modern economic development, the centrality of intangibles extends well beyond digitization and information technology. In fact, intangibles are at the heart of productivity and profits in a wide variety of \"traditional\" economic sectors, including manufacturing. (58) Nevertheless, investment in intangibles is underreported and underappreciated because intangibles investment is frequently recognized as an operating expenditure rather than capital investment. (59) Off the balance sheet, computers and the internet are just the tip of the intangibles iceberg. (60) Moreover, the shift from tangible to intangible investment \"isn't primarily about information technology.\" (61) A myopic focus on the \"digital\" economy, thus, misses the significance of intangibles investment to productivity and profitability across an array of sectors in developed economies. (62) Tax policy must take notice of these developments because intangibles are at the core of global excess profits.</p><p>Economists Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provide a typology to categorize the intangibles economy. (63) Intangible investment consists of: 1) economic competencies; 2) innovative property; and 3) computerized information. \"Computerized information\" is the most familiar. (64) Software and database development are two dominant areas. \"Big Data,\" \"Data Analytics,\" and the \"Cloud\" are further variants of \"computerized information\" and what is often colloquy understood as the \"digital economy.\" \"Innovative property\" is a second category that consists of activities directed at information discovery or creative production, e.g. research and development, artistic composition, design and other product development. Both \"computerized information\" and \"innovative property\" are protected under traditional intellectual property law, i.e. patent, copyright, and trademark. The final category, \"economic competencies,\" consists of firm specific training, market research, branding, and organizational capital, such as business process knowledge. \"Economic competencies\" are sometimes protected under intellectual property law as trade secrets. (65) On a firm balance sheet, economic competencies are recognized as \"goodwill\" since they represent a residual between the net asset value and firm enterprise value. As the above categories reflect, information technology is just one among varied forms of intangible investment.</p><p>A narrow focus on information technology as the lynchpin of modern economic growth misses the wide array of sectors that exploit intangibles to realize excess profits in the global economy. (66) Simply put, there is more to the \"digital\" economy than computers and data. EU member states such as Germany seem to realize as much. (67) Absent, however, from the EU debate about \"digital taxation\" is a full appreciation for how the \"intangibles\" economy extends well beyond information technology/ (18) European policymakers must look beyond the hype of \"Big Tech\" and \"Big Data\" to the real factors driving productivity and profitability in the EU and around the globe. (69)</p><p>Accordingly, EU and OECD efforts to revitalize tax tools for the modern economy should orient themselves around a broad GILTI conception of intangibles as excess profits in order to share in revenues from resident firm exploitation of foreign markets. (70) Just as the iPhone is \"Designed in California,\" there are products designed in Milan, Munich, and Manchester that depend on resident EU member state subsidies offered with respect to productive factors like education, legal, and physical infrastructure. EU member states must remember the centrality of intangibles to excess profits as they transition from \"targeting\" digital taxation to shaping sustainable and productive rules of international taxation in an increasingly intangibles driven global economy.</p><p>D. Excess Profits</p><p>To evaluate GILTI's taxation of excess profits through a broad conception of intangibles, the link between economic intangibles and excess profits must be established. The following analysis defends \"excess profits\" as an object of international taxation, discusses the comparative costs and benefits of traditional innovation incentives, and concludes with an overview of the international tax competition landscape for innovation incentives.</p><p>Taxing profits is efficient because \"pure profits are worth claiming even when reduced by a tax bill.\" (71) Rents in excess of normal returns are economic surplus. Like normal profits, this surplus is shared between a firm and its resident government based on the relative market power of the firm and its resident government to set and adhere to base and rate terms. A resident sovereign's taxing power is limited most fundamentally by the threat of exit: the ability of a firm to change its residence through inversion or reincorporation. (72) Viewed independently, taxation of excess profits might be seen as a disincentive to resident firms since GILTI like taxes increase the resident sovereign's potential share of resident firm excess profits. But when an excess profits tax like GILTI enables a regime of partial exemption (territoriality), the net effect can be to increase the attractiveness of domestic corporate residency. To start with, excess profits taxation can provide countries revenue to pay for resident-based tax subsidies. Moreover, GILTI only kicks in when foreign income is subject to a low foreign source rate.</p><p>It is important to distinguish \"normal\" returns from excess returns in evaluating the importance of competitiveness to resident firms in foreign markets. (73) If a tax system, such as worldwide taxation without full crediting of foreign source taxes prevents U.S. firms from competing for investment in foreign opportunities for normal returns (because the U.S. after-tax rate of return exceeds the after-tax rate of foreign producers), the U.S. firm has foregone an opportunity for 'normal' returns that can be achieved elsewhere. (74) Excess profits above a 'normal' rate present a different story. (75) A U.S. tax system that prevented U.S. firms from competing in foreign markets for excess returns would reduce national welfare understood as a combination of U.S. tax revenue and profits attributable to U.S. shareholders. If a U.S. firm loses out to a foreign firm in realizing an opportunity for excess profits abroad, the economic surplus is not realized by a U.S. person and is, thus, unavailable for sharing between the firm and sovereign.</p><p>The opportunity cost of missing out on foreign excess returns is a strong justification in moving to a more territorial international income tax. Whether conceptualized as the taxation of excess profits or a global minimum tax, GILTI allows the United States to capture part of the benefits to U.S. firms of exploiting foreign opportunities for excess profits. Taxation of excess profits is, thus, a mechanism for sharing in resident firms' exploitation of foreign excess profits while also enabling resident firms to realize foreign profit opportunities through a shift to partial exemption of foreign profits above a minimum tax rate. Last but not least, a resident-based global minimum tax allows resident sovereigns to recapture subsidies conferred on resident firms and, thus, fund future productivity enhancing benefits afforded to resident firms.</p><p>E. Traditional Intangible/Innovation Incentives</p><p>GILTI enables resident tax benefits and neutralizes some of the appeal of the foreign-source locational incentives available as traditional \"innovation\" incentives. While GILTI is not itself a locational incentive, its general applicability to resident shareholders has an indirect effect on the comparative tax benefit of foreign and domestic innovation subsidies. Because GILTI is a minimum tax on foreign source income, the comparative economic value of domestic and foreign subsidies varies depending on whether a foreign subsidy triggers GILTI income. Consequently, the incentive effects of GILTI's minimum tax must be viewed within the larger global tax benefit marketplace for mobile \"innovation\" income and investment. Innovation incentives in the U.S. and EU generally take three forms: 1) tax benefits (credit/deduction) for research and development (R&amp;D); 2) manufacturing incentives, and 3) tax benefits for IP source income (patent boxes) (discussed in Part III). (76)</p><p>The TCJA did not disturb the U.S. R&amp;D incentive. (77) Since GILTI applies to foreign source income, the R&amp;D credit is not impacted directly by GILTI. However, since GILTI has the potential to lessen the comparative benefit of foreign innovation incentives, e.g. foreign patent boxes, GILTI might increase the incentive for U.S. domestic companies to engage in domestic R&amp;D. (78) A major limitation of the U.S. R&amp;D credit is that it is not refundable. (79) Despite this potential weakness, the TCJA preserved a defensible locational innovation incentive in the U.S. R&amp;D Credit, (80) and further increased the marginal benefit of U.S. R&amp;D for domestic firms. (81)</p><p>Locational incentives sometimes take the form of manufacturing subsidies. (82) While modern economic terminology (and tax policy) often relies on a rigid dichotomy between \"traditional\" and \"innovative\" technologies, the reality is more complex. (83) Many global production efficiencies rely on complex supply-chains and organizational knowledge. (84) While intangibles are important to manufacturing, the case for direct locational incentives for \"advanced\" manufacturing is less clear cut. (85) One justification for manufacturing incentives is tax competition--the need to attract and maintain manufacturing activities. (86) Despite general political support for such measures, as a matter of tax policy, manufacturing-specific economic incentives are not generally believed to be economically efficient. (87) Set against the international tax competition landscape, the argument for U.S. manufacturing incentives is even weaker because locational incentives are limited under the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). (88)</p><p>EU member states have resorted to second-best policy tools like patent boxes in part because of EU law limitations on locational incentives. (89) In the face of limitations on locational incentives, EU member states have adopted sub-optimal tax incentives like patent boxes. Instead of encouraging productive factor competition--a significant goal behind limitations on locational benefits--patent box regimes further exacerbate base erosion and profit shifting. A tax incentive purported to increase \"innovation\" activity in fact undermines competition by European countries to offer an optimal package of productive factors.</p><p>III. EU/OECD MEASURES TO \"COMBAT\" TAX COMPETITION</p><p>Unilateral U.S. measures such as GILTI can mitigate collective action problems that multilateral initiatives fail to resolve. An essential premise of this thesis is that multilateralism is not working--at least not on certain international tax issues. This section diagnoses the problem of failed multilateralism through a description of the BEPS initiative on \"harmful\" tax competition. As part of that discussion, patent boxes, the predominate European incentive for \"intangible incentives\" are introduced to frame the incentives and strategies of nation states in the international tax competition game simulated in Part V.</p><p>The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project represents an effort to combat tax avoidance through multilateral agreement on general rules of international taxation. (90) The backbone principle of the BEPS project is to foster a locational nexus in international taxation. Under the locational nexus principle, taxation of profits is aligned with the location of real economic activity. Despite the declared success of BEPS, a review of Action Item 5 shows that some purported BEPS successes depend on prior unilateral initiatives more than the multilateral BEPS process itself. Moreover, EU law limitations have prevented the OECD from fully endorsing a standard consistent with its preferred tax policy principle. The failures exhibited in BEPS Action Item 5 provide evidence consistent with game theoretical predictions about the challenges of multilateral action when there are dominant incentives to defect from cooperation.</p><p>BEPS Action Item 5 (\"Action 5\") produced three major outputs under its self-identified principles of coherence, substance, and transparency. (91) On substance, Action 5 implements a substantial activity requirement through a \"nexus\" principle for qualifying income under a preferential tax regime. On transparency, Action 5 implements compulsory exchange of information for all rulings that could give rise to base erosion or profit shifting concerns. On coherence, Action 5 reviewed all extant OECD preferential regimes and required modification and future compliance with the new BEPS \"substantial activity\" standard. Although the inquiry into \"Harmful Tax Practices\" (Action 5), focused on three principles (substance, transparency, and coherence), it yielded one major yet counterintuitive output: a formula for designing an OECD compliant patent box. (92)</p><p>A patent box is a back-end preferential tax regime for intellectual property (IP) related income. (93) Patent boxes are sometimes referred to as \"innovation boxes\" since they are often open to IP beyond patents. Patent boxes are a controversial tax incentive and form of tax competition because they tend to promote base erosion and profit shifting of mobile IP income. (94) In contrast to front-end R&amp;D incentives, which provide tax benefits when expenses are incurred, patent boxes reduce the tax liability for earned income from qualifying IP. (95) In principle, both front-end and back-end regimes can incentivize the location of real economic activity, but the efficacy of any tax benefit regime depends on its ability to prevent strategic taxpayer behavior. Defenders of patent box regimes claim that they incentivize development of productive industry through prospective investment in research and development of intangibles. Despite this justification, absent locational limitations on qualifying income, patent boxes can also promote \"harmful\" base erosion and profit shifting. (96) In theory, therefore, patent boxes might easily constitute harmful tax competition and should be limited by anti-abuse rules that confine the strategic attribution of income to patent box jurisdictions or the transfer of IP to patent box regimes after receipt of front-end tax subsidies in another jurisdiction. On the surface, BEPS purported to limit patent boxes consistent with its overarching principle of \"locational\" nexus--a belief that tax rights should align with the location of economic activity. In practice, however, BEPS endorsed a watered-down limitation on patent boxes that effectively provided a compliance manual for designing an OECD sanctioned preferential tax regime.</p><p>BEPS Action Item 5 endorses a \"substantial activity\" standard through a \"nexus\" approach to qualifying income for tax benefits under preferential tax regimes. (97) \"Substantial nexus\" qualifies income in a patent box according to expenditures by a single entity located in the patent box jurisdiction. (98) The \"nexus\" ratio is determined by qualifying expenditures, which serve as a proxy for real economic activity in the patent box jurisdiction. (99) A subtle but significant element of the \"substantial nexus\" standard is that it permits two differing standards for defining qualifying expenditures. (100) Because of EU law limitations on locational benefits, the predominate standard looks to the location of the single entity incurring expenditures. (101) The alternative standard, acceptable for countries not subject to EU law or similar limitations on locational benefits, allows qualifying expenditures to be calculated based on the jurisdiction (i.e. location) of activities related to the expenditure. (102) In what some have deemed the \"Luxembourg Effect,\" EU law limitations thus resulted in a suboptimal global minimum standard. (103) While BEPS purported to implement a \"better\" global standard through multilateral consensus, it instead provided a sub-optimal rule (considering tax competition effects) necessitated by the domestic law limitations of leading members of the OECD's multilateral body.</p><p>At the heart of the BEPS debate about the \"substantial nexus\" standard was a political divide among OECD member states concerning the \"harmful\" effects of patent boxes. (104) Not surprisingly, whether a given incentive is \"harmful\" often rests in the eye of the beholder. Countries that offer low-tax incentives for IP through \"patent boxes\" do not find these regimes \"harmful\" (or at least they hope they're not). In contracts, countries with resident firms that might shift income or R&amp;D spending to low-tax countries offering incentives correctly perceive patent boxes as harmful. Consistent with these conflicting, if simultaneously accurate, perspectives on \"harmful\" tax competition, Germany, a country without a patent box, led a coalition in the OECD to limit patent boxes. (105) The German coalition was opposed by a coalition led by the U.K., which itself promotes a patent box. In the end, horse trading produced a \"modified\" \"substantial nexus\" standard that represents as much a political compromise within the EU on tax competition as a bona fide reform of international tax standards. (106) At least with respect to preferential regimes, it's hard to argue Action 5 represents any reform at all. Instead of scrapping a primary vehicle for base erosion and profit shifting, Action 5 exacerbates the professed illness by prescribing a compliance manual for OECD approved patent box incentives.</p><p>Action 5 represents a failed multilateral effort to combat base erosion and profit shifting. Instead of producing a superior global standard through multilateral negotiation and consensus, the OECD settled on a sub-optimal rule motivated in part by EU law limitations. The political backstory to the modified nexus standard further exposes the veiled multilateralism of certain aspects of the BEPS project. Behind the shroud of multinational collaboration, two national power players (U.K. and Germany) negotiated a truce that received an institutional stamp of multilateralism from the OECD. Is institutional OECD approval not ultimately a signal multinational consensus? No, it is not! Cooperative behavior does not necessarily imply actual benefit to cooperating parties. (107)</p><p>The failure of a single multilateral effort does not necessarily doom the multilateral process in international tax. Indeed, the transparency prong of Action 5 has been lauded as a success story for multilateralism. (108) In contrast to efforts at reforming preferential tax regimes, the tax competition landscape for bank secrecy (and thus exchange of financial information) had undergone a monumental shift prior to the BEPS project. Viewed historically, however, even the purported multilateral success of Action 5's transparency initiatives depended on prior unilateral U.S. measures regarding compulsory exchange of information for global financial institutions.</p><p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is U.S. domestic legislation that requires the exchange of banking information from financial institutions that operate within the U.S. banking system that relates to foreign account ownership. FATCA is a unilateral U.S. measure aimed at combatting a problem plagued by collective inaction--tax evasion through abuse of bank secrecy and non-exchange of taxpayer information by non-resident financial institutions. While FATCA is unilateral in form, it proved multilateral in effect, precipitating bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat illegal tax evasion. (109) While EU politicians and banks initially reacted with outrage over FATCA's unilateral approach and purportedly \"extraterritorial\" requirements, European leaders ultimately came to appreciate that FATCA provided a \"unique opportunity to move from a series of bilateral agreements to multilateral agreements\" on exchange of taxpayer information. (110) FATCA provided European countries cover to negotiate a multilateral agreement in an area plagued by ineffectual bilateral measures. (111) As the FATCA backstory elucidates, multilateral efforts on information exchange had crystalized before BEPS started, much less delivered on, its Action 5 outputs. As this timeline suggests, BEPS' transparency related \"reforms\" largely incorporated prior EU multilateral initiatives made possible because of, not in spite of, U.S. unilateral action. (112)</p><p>The cooperative potential of a unilateral measure like FATCA does not undermine the importance of subsequent multilateral agreement. With GILTI, it remains to be seen whether other resident countries will recognize the cooperative potential afforded by GILTI and implement similar forms of minimum resident taxation of foreign source benefits. What the FATCA history makes clear, however, is that the multilateral process itself did not precipitate the global tax policy success on compulsory exchange of financial information. Instead, the FATCA backstory to BEPS suggests that subsequent multilateral agreement and cooperation was enabled by prior U.S. unilateral measures. GILTI offers a similar opportunity for second stage cooperative action. (113)</p><p>IV. INTERNATIONAL TAX COMPETITION: NATIONAL WELFARE &amp; UNILATERAL INCENTIVES</p><p>Traditional normative principles of international tax policy rest on assumptions about global welfare based in neo-classical trade theory.' (14) In contrast to the cooperative surplus available under international trade theory, in which national welfare is maximized through elimination of barriers to trade with shared gains from comparative advantage, the international tax arena is defined in part by adversity. (115) Adversity need not imply hostility as an adverse game can be resolved through strategic cooperation.</p><p>International tax policy is often evaluated under competing norms of capital export neutrality (CEN), capital import neutrality (CIN) (a.k.a. \"savings neutrality\"), capital ownership neutrality (CON), national neutrality (NN), and national ownership neutrality (NON). (116) In domestic tax policy, an ideal point is posited at some intersection of the competing norms of efficiency and equity. In international tax policy, an ideal point might also reside at some intersection of these various neutrality norms. The challenge in both the domestic and international contexts is to identify that ideal point. For a variety of reasons, there is no prevailing consensus. (117) Moreover, as in the domestic context, attempts to maximize a single norm might create double-distortions that offset the benefits of maximizing any one of the preferred CxN neutrality benchmarks. (118)</p><p>The principle flaw in the international tax policy neutrality framework is that it is predicated on maximizing global welfare. The players (national sovereigns) in the international tax competition game are not interested in global welfare. Nation state policymakers (the tax competition players) are responsive to the welfare of their national constituencies. (119) Because global welfare is not an accurate description of the strategic incentives of tax policymakers, it is not very helpful in analyzing the constraints and objectives of national policymakers in crafting international tax rules in a policy landscape subject to tax competition. (120) Rejecting the \"global welfare\" premise of the neutrality benchmark frameworks does not require abandoning the terminology of international tax neutralities. (121) A politically descriptive model of international tax competition, i.e. a positive model of political behavior based on the real world incentives of international tax policymakers, can be formulated using the traditional neutrality benchmarks. Although the international capital neutrality concepts have traditionally been deployed under a framework that seeks to maximize global welfare, these same concepts can equally be applied to maximize a concept of national welfare based on the strategic interests of national constituencies.</p><p>National welfare in a positive model of international tax competition consists of a combination of the interest of \"American firms\" and the U.S. \"marketplace.\" Michael Knoll introduced these two concepts of the \"national\" market to categorize U.S. debate about the tax \"competitiveness.\" (122) Knoll shows that two distinct conceptions of \"competitiveness\" in international tax policy are grounded in different conceptions of domestic industry. (123) In one case, competitiveness focuses on U.S. resident firms; in the other, competitiveness focuses on the domestic market, which includes domestic and foreign firms in the U.S.:</p><p>The two conceptions of competitiveness... have different implications for how taxation affects competitiveness. In addition, the two conceptions of competitiveness have different implications for how the domestic industry is defined and for the mechanism through which taxation affects competitiveness. The first conception of competitiveness focuses on how taxation affects the ability of firms to compete in different locations. Thus, the first conception of competitiveness defines a state's industry by the total output (both domestic and foreign) of the companies based in that state. In contrast, the second conception of competitiveness focuses on how taxation affects the ability of states to attract investment and labor. Thus, the second conception of competitiveness defines a state's industry by the total output of that industry in that state without regard to the nationality of the producing company.</p><p>The political debate around tax competitiveness has pitted these conceptually distinct concepts of welfare against one another. In fact, both concepts affect national welfare and are, thus, linked to the incentives of national policymakers in the international tax competition game. Nevertheless, depending on the definition of domestic industry, and thus the related concept of national welfare, different tax neutrality benchmarks take on varying degrees of importance.</p><p>The first conception of domestic industry refers to \"American\" firms that are tax residents in the U.S. Under the \"American\" firm conception, CON is important. CON promotes what economists refer to as competitive neutrality--a system in which the total tax on a particular investment is the same no matter the residence of the taxpayer. (124) Traditionally, the welfare effects of ownership neutrality were perceived to be minimal, but recent economic research has led to increased appreciation of the economic consequences of violating CON. (125)</p><p>The second conception of domestic industry refers to the U.S. economic \"marketplace.\" Under the U.S. \"marketplace\" view, CEN is important. CEN promotes what economists refer to as locational neutrality--a system in which the total tax on investment should be the same regardless of whether a taxpayer invests in their resident state or in a foreign state. Locational neutrality implies that a firm should be indifferent between retaining its capital for domestic investment or exporting its capital for foreign investment.</p><p>The international tax competition game modelled below presumes that political actors attempt to maximize an ideal combination of both concepts of national welfare discussed above. Policymakers might discuss competitiveness by focusing only on a particular concept, e.g. \"bringing jobs home,\" promoting a national champion, or \"helping our companies compete overseas.\" Despite potentially narrow rhetoric, public choice theory predicts that where interest groups have an interest at stake, as both domestic and foreign producers in the domestic market do in shaping domestic adoption of international tax rules, these groups (assuming sufficient political access and organizational ability) will communicate the economic stakes to policymakers. Whether directly or as a result of political processes, \"national\" economic interests will thus be communicated to political representatives and percolate to policymakers. Proceeding on the assumption that policymakers thus have direct or indirect knowledge of a broad conception of national welfare (both Knoll's national firm and domestic market concepts), the international tax competition game assumes national policymakers will seek to best maximize their perceived national preferences in negotiating and adopting international tax rules. (126) Before proceeding to the tax competition game, a note about the concept of tax competition and how it differs from the market competition of industrial organization economics.</p><p>Tax competition generally \"refers to competition between jurisdictions based on their corporate income tax systems.\" (127) In private markets, competition is widely presumed to be beneficial to consumers by lowering prices and preventing deadweight loss of monopoly or cartel prices. (128) There is not a similar consensus in public markets. The traditional \"defense\" of tax competition is rooted in part on a Tiebout model of interjurisdictional competition in which tax and benefits competition creates incentives to maximize taxpayer welfare by offering an optimal bundle of taxes and benefits. (129) Depending on the degree of transaction costs, labor and capital will gravitate towards the jurisdiction that maximizes its preferred combination of taxes and benefits. (130) Under the Tiebout model, as in the standard price model for private markets, competition is normatively good.</p><p>In private markets, competition leads to downward prices that benefit consumers and avoids deadweight loss. Under Tiebout's model, interjurisdictional competition leads to a superior diversity of tax/benefits regimes that support citizens and firms as the consumers of public goods. (131) On the producer side of the equation, the similarities between private and public markets diverge. In contrast to the revenue-oriented producers of private markets, sovereigns in public markets are concerned not just with tax revenue but also with general national welfare. (132) Tax revenue is an intermediary good necessary to provide final public goods. Indeed, the purpose behind many tax subsidies is substitution of tax revenue for future national welfare. For example, the purported objectives of many tax incentives on mobile income are not distributional, i.e. a wealth transfers to preferred forms of activity, but productive efficiency--encouraging productive activity that will have an economic effect in excess of the conferred benefit. Because private producers and sovereigns have differing welfare functions, the traditional \"market\" analysis of competition from private markets does not necessarily fit tax competition. In markets for public goods, governments are trying to maximize national welfare and are thus interested not only in the revenue they collect from producers, but also in the distributional impact that tax rules will have on both conceptions of the home market--the national firm view and the domestic market view. (133) Sovereigns want to ensure that resident firms can compete abroad while also ensuring the domestic market is attractive for investment. Tax competition is not purely an inter-jurisdictional game. (134) Taxpayers, specifically MNEs, participate in shaping and exploiting tax competition through tax avoidance. (135) Taxpayers with market power--the ability to influence prices in the market for tax and benefits--thus, influence tax rates and bases. Taxpayer \"market power\" on rate and base definition can be harmful to sovereigns in two ways. First, monopsony (buyer) power among MNE taxpayers can lead to suboptimal rate structures for sovereigns. For example, governments might engage in a \"race to the bottom\" on rate or base definition in order to capture revenue or retain economic activity. Second, MNEs can obtain tax benefits by operating across jurisdictions that are not available to solely domestic producers. (136) The national welfare of competing sovereigns in the tax competition game is reduced under both scenarios as compared with a scenario in which sovereigns cooperate to minimize MNE market power. In theory, therefore, sovereigns should cooperate. Arguably, that is a principle purpose of multilateral organizations like the OECD. Yet, cooperation need not always take the form of multilateral action and consensus building. Dominant incentives towards defection plague cooperative action in both private and sovereign cartels. An alternative model of cooperative action depends on a two-staged game. In stage one, a dominant player unilaterally commits to a strategy with cooperative surplus. At stage two, the remaining sovereigns have cover to engage in cooperative strategies without facing a credible threat of exit or avoidance from MNEs or resident firms with mobile income.</p><p>V. THE TAXMAN'S DILEMMA: U.S. UNILATERAL ACTION AND COOPERATIVE SURPLUS</p><p>Borrowing a framework from game theory, mobile source income tax incentives mirror a classic Prisoner's Dilemma in the international tax arena. (137) In the Prisoner's Dilemma, there is a dominant 'noncooperative' strategy for all parties (sovereigns in the tax context) to pursue individual (national) interest in a way that leads to suboptimal joint outcomes. The Prisoner's Dilemma plays out in the international tax context in the battle to provide source income benefits to mobile capital. In this context, governments have a dominant incentive to offer locational benefits on source income that steers mobile income (and possibly economic activity) to a particular jurisdiction. The foreseeable consequence of this individually rational action by governments is to forego the potential for joint maximization of revenue through a cooperative solution regarding international tax rules for mobile economic activity or property.</p><p>The typical solution for parties trapped in a collective action problem like the Prisoner's Dilemma with a dominant solution that is suboptimal is to convincingly communicate strategy to their counterparties. (138) In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the actors cannot communicate, hence the dilemma of taking sub-optimal action based on rational estimation of counterparty incentives. In the international tax arena, communication and cooperation is possible and can be accomplished through multilateral organizations like the OECD. Alternatively, unilateral action that credibly convinces counterparties that a player acting unilaterally will take a particular course of action can overcome a barrier to cooperation.</p><p>The traditional Prisoner's Dilemma contemplates that the prisoners are confined and unable to communicate. The Taxman's Dilemma is less restricted. The tax competition game is often staged, so parties can observe counterparty actions and adjust strategies based on counterparty action. If a counterparty sovereign knows or can accurately predict how a counterparty will act, she can rationally adjust her strategy to maximize her individual and joint welfare through a higher payoff strategy. If the same party were to act defensively (i.e. rationally pursuing a lower payoff strategy because she lacks knowledge of how her counterparty will act), she would undermine her own welfare as well as potential joint welfare.</p><p>In the real-world tax competition game, GILTI is a unilateral strategy that enables subsequent cooperative behavior. GILTI is unilateral because it is a domestic law response to the collective action problem of tax competition for mobile source income. GILTI has cooperative potential because as a resident-based global minimum tax, it reduces the marginal benefit for profit shifting among foreign jurisdictions by U.S. MNEs. As Mindy Herzfeld has argued, \"by removing the incentives for U.S. multinationals to engage in tax planning that reduces their blended foreign tax rate to below 13 percent, the United States has essentially agreed to prop up the corporate tax regimes--and hence the tax bases--of high-tax countries.\" (139) GILTI is cooperative in another respect. In addition to reducing the incentive for profit shifting by U.S. MNEs, GILTI gives non-U.S. sovereigns some pricing power on tax rate and base terms. This is because GILTI imposes a quasi price-floor for global MNE rate and base terms by way of its limitation on foreign source tax benefits. (140) Because the marketplace for foreign source incentives for mobile income is dominated by MNE's, an effective minimum global rate on U.S. MNEs provides cover to non-U.S. sovereigns to match the U.S. price-floor without threatening the competitiveness of resident firms. (141)</p><p>The United States' outsized influence over MNEs gives it coercive power to affect global incentives for base erosion and profit shifting. (142) Because MNEs play a crucial role in the tax competition and tax avoidance games, the U.S.'s outsized influence on \"market\" rates for MNEs provides the U.S. with coercive power in the international tax competition game. (143) Returning to private market economics, the U.S. Treasury is a price-maker, whereas many European treasuries are price-takers in the competition for MNE global tax revenues. By setting a global minimum effective tax rate for MNE excess profits, the U.S. provides cover for other developed countries to impose similar defensive measures.</p><p>The potential of large resident economies to implement global minimum tax rates on foreign source income that cluster around a U.S. unilateral price ultimately enables beneficial competition with regards to productive factors. This final point is often overlooked. The true cooperative surplus from global minimum taxation is not that it allows resident sovereigns to recapture subsidies that enable excess profits--although this is a tremendous accomplishment. The true cooperative surplus of global minimum taxes on foreign source income is the potential for resident sovereigns to compete on productive factors rather than source tax rate and base definition.</p><p>The game theory behind the Taxman's Dilemma plays out in the real-world practice of international tax competition. In the tax competition game, a sovereign with strong factors of production, e.g. Germany, might like to adopt a global minimum tax. (144) Under a benefits rationale, Germany might believe that the ability of domestic (German) multinational automakers to earn excess profits abroad is driven by benefits (legal, educational, infrastructure) provided in Germany. To the dismay of domestic constituencies, Germany might be unable to realize its preferred tax policy (e.g. limiting EU patent boxes) because competing sovereigns (e.g. U.K.) in the multilateral process have rational individual incentives to defect and veto multilateral limitations on base erosion and profit shifting. (145)</p><p>Enter GILTI. Before a U.S. global minimum tax, even a large economy like Germany might have been hesitant to implement additional taxation on resident firms because of the threat of domestic firm exit or a reduction in competitiveness for domestic producers in the pursuit of foreign excess profits. Yet, once a sovereign with sufficient market power has credibly committed to resident based taxation of foreign source excess profits (as the U.S. has done with GILTI), other sovereigns have cover to implement similar defensive measures to capture excess profits and limit the benefits of profit shifting. Rather than thwarting cooperative solutions, U.S. unilateral action under these circumstances enables other sovereigns to pursue individually beneficial strategies with cooperative surplus. The ultimate surplus from this cooperative sovereign behavior is not just additional tax revenue for resident sovereigns. The golden egg of global minimum taxation of foreign source excess profits is a tax competition landscape that enables competition on productive factors like education, law, and infrastructure, rather than tax rate and base terms.</p><p>Staged cooperative action can be superior to a single-stage multilateral process in combating harmful tax competition because it respects tax sovereignty and allows jurisdictional diversity. Because a resident based global minimum tax is a domestic-law rule, adoption of GILTI like tax tools in Europe requires no compromise or negotiation among EU member states regarding design and distributional effects. Germany can enact a resident based global minimum tax without the threat of veto from Ireland or the U.K. (146)</p><p>Nor does a global minimum tax alter competing countries' tax sovereignty to set attractive rate and base terms for source and resident income. (147) EU member state adoption of a GILTI like tool undoubtedly entails distributional consequence for low tax jurisdictions that have benefitted to date from mobile income shifting out of high tax resident jurisdictions. (148) But resident based global minimum taxation does not preclude low-tax jurisdictions from competing for new productive activity based on a leaner and more efficient regulatory, tax, and tax-benefits offering to new or relocating firms.</p><p>In response to GILTI, low-tax jurisdictions will be forced to recalibrate whether they offer an ideal combination of productive benefits and tax incentives in a new tax competition world undergirded by global minimum effective rates for MNE income. The ideal mix of tax rates and benefits likely varies firm to firm and sector to sector. (149) Individual or cultural factors might further impact the ideal combination or rates and benefits for a particular jurisdiction. Viewed in light of Tiebout's emphasis on the benefits of interjurisdictional competition, global minimum taxation does not destroy the benefits of tax diversity. Just as the states in the United States compete in the provision of education, infrastructure, and law,</p><p>European countries can hope as the result of resident based global minimum taxation to engage in healthy competition for productive factors.</p><p>VI. CONCLUSION</p><p>Sovereignty and multilateralism have become buzzwords defining ideological battle lines in international relations. (150) International tax policy is a technical field that must skirt these ideological battles and avoid aligning with or being driven by simple theories of multilateralism or unilateralism. (151) While the OECD in BEPS initially took an ideological approach in arguing that cooperation stands in conflict with unilateralism, this paper shows how unilateral measures can foster beneficial cooperation in international tax policy. (152) As the FATCA/BEPS histories and GILTI parallels suggest, cooperative action is facilitated under certain circumstances through unilateral action with the potential for cooperative surplus.</p><p>Understood as a harmonized global tax rate, a global minimum tax might operate as the sword of a sovereign cartel without clear productive efficiencies. (153) GILTI takes a different approach. It does not attempt to impose or align on a global minimum tax rate by way of multilateral horse-trading. Instead, GILTI implements a resident based global minimum tax that enables productive factor competition while respecting traditional principals of tax sovereignty. GILTI thus allows competing sovereigns to set their own rate and base terms. GILTI merely limits the benefit that foreign source rates confer on resident foreign firms. (154) As a result, GILTI's resident based global minimum tax shifts international tax competition away from a cat and mouse game of tracking down and labelling \"tax havens\" or \"harmful\" tax competition. Instead, the hunt for \"harmful\" tax competition is replaced with a productive experiment among competing tax jurisdictions for the optimal array of resident benefits that allow resident firms to exploit excess profits at home and abroad. As EU member states and countries around the world seek to develop international tax policy for the \"digital age,\" productive factor competition ought to be a primary goal. (155) By enabling resident sovereigns to share in excess profits, GILTI and other resident based global minimum taxes incentivize competition on productive economic factors. GILTI promotes productive factor competition while also retaining foundational principals of tax sovereignty that protect resident firms operating in foreign markets. (156) As some European countries have already come to appreciate, GILTI is a tax tool \"Made in America\" for European tax.</p><p>G. Charles Beller (*)</p><p>(*) G.

In theory, a global minimum tax need not exacerbate challenges of foreign profit allocation since global minimum taxation turns on residual excess profits. If the trigger for global minimum taxation turns on foreign effective rates, a resident sovereign and resident firm should be indifferent about allocation of profits that generate comparable effective rates. In practice, the design of a global minimum tax, e.g. country by country vs. consolidated reporting, surely impacts firm incentives to allocate profits strategically.

See, e.g., Graetz, supra note 8, at 317. U.S. technology MNEs and even the U.S. government have made precisely this \"selective enforcement\" argument in the context of European Commission state aid investigations despite bona fide legal issues under EU law.

Kleinbard, \"Competitiveness\" Has Nothing to Do With It, 144 TAX NOTES 1055 (Sept. 1,2014). Although excess profits taxation runs the risk of incentivizing \"exit\" from a resident state, excess profits taxation of foreign source income can enable retention if it increases resident firm competitiveness in foreign markets. For example, in the case of the TCJA, the move towards a territorial regime with partial exemption promotes the competitiveness of resident firms in foreign markets under the concept of capital ownership neutrality (CON). Through partial exemption, U.S. firms investing abroad will face similar effective tax rates as foreign firms that pay only the source rate, so long as the foreign source rate does not trigger an additional GILTI inclusion for the U.S. firm.</p><p>(73) See Shaviro, supra note 55, at 155.</p><p>(74) See Shaviro, supra note 55, at 155.</p><p>(75) See Shaviro, supra note 55, at 155.</p><p>(76) Michael Graetz and Rachel Doud summarized the landscape of intangibles incentives circa 2013 in Technological Innovation, International Competition and the Challenge of International Income Taxation.

The primary restriction on the entity approach stems from limitations on qualifying expenditures from related party transactions and acquisitions of foreign income producing assets. For example, the entity approach does not recognize expenditures by a related party as qualifying expenditures, even if the related party is located in the jurisdiction providing benefits. Moreover, the entity approach does not qualify income related to the expense of acquiring foreign IP. In contrast, a locational approach to substantial nexus qualifies expenses related to income derived from foreign acquired IP and from R&amp;D outsourced to a related party, so long as the acquisition and outsourcing occur in the jurisdiction offering the preferential regime. In short, the locational approach maintains many of the locational benefits associated with \"old\" patent box regimes while limiting the provision of benefits for purely foreign activities (e.g. managing foreign IP). The entity approach goes a step further by excluding expenditures that are both foreign to the jurisdiction (locational) as well as \"foreign\" (in the organizational sense) to the entity seeking benefits (e.g. related party transfer within a common jurisdiction).</p><p>(101) See Faulhaber, supra note 89.</p><p>(102) see Faulhaber, supra note 89.

See, e.g., Grinberg, supra note 112, at 158-59 (\"[A]lthough the FATCA success story is remarkable, the combination of unilateral US coercive pressure and multilateral coordination towards a global standard of information-exchange succeeded because the underlying issue was an enforcement measure in which the interest among major economic powers were generally aligned and the benefits from agreement were non-rival... Asa result, the FATCA/Common Reporting System story, while itself fascinating, is not a straightforward model for achieving global tax co-operation in areas affecting the tax burden imposed on taxpayers under substantive tax law and the division of the tax base and distribution of tax revenue among the major economies.\").</p><p>(114) See TSILLY DAGAN, INTERNATIONAL TAX POLICY: BETWEEN COMPETITION &amp; COOPERATION 51 (2018) (\"Although focused on unilateral national policies, the neutrality debate took a global perspective... Proponents of neutrality implicitly assumed that the goal of international taxation policy - despite being designed and set by individual states - is the promotion of global welfare; this policy goal, they hold, should guide national policymakers and can be achieved, so the argument suggested, through their independent unilateral actions even in a decentralized international tax regime.\").</p><p>(115) See generally Tsilly Dagan, The Tax Treaties Myth, 32 N.Y.U.

But at the same time, surely there are cases in which a territorial approach would forestall use of the wrong ownership arrangement, thereby advancing CON.

Both the home firm view and home market view are reasonably encompassed within national welfare. When \"American\" firms are able to better compete for opportunities across the globe to allocate capital (CON), U.S. shareholders and employees of national firms benefit. Similarly, when all firms are able to compete with similar after-tax incentives for allocating capital in the United States (CEN), American workers and the American economy benefits from the spillover effects of foreign direct investment (FDI). Since different international tax policies (favoring CON vs. CEN) will have different impacts on different but equally defensible notions of national welfare, if s difficult to select a preferred neutrality benchmark unless one has a preferred conception of the home market.</p><p>(134) Some argue that the \"term 'harmful tax competition' cannot be defined because the term has no intrinsic meaning\" since it is used strategically by \"politicians, policymakers, and academics to mask their normative preferences.\" See e.g. Faulhaber, supra note 22, at 58.</p><p>(135) Faulhaber, supra note 22, at 58 (\"taxpayers, in the form of large multinational corporations, now have the market power to demand rate reductions, tax rulings, or the like from jurisdictions, which means that they are spurring on tax competition in order to distort the market in which they compete... If this is the case, then tax competition is not, as those who extrapolate from the Tiebout model to argue in favor of unfettered international tax competition would claim, just another version of market competition. Instead, in certain circumstances, international tax competition may be distorting market competition if it is taking place in the fonn of rulings or preferential regimes that allow certain taxpayers to shift the playing field in their favor against their market competitors.\").</p><p>(136) See, e.g., Edward Kleinbard, Stateless Income, 11 FI.A. TAX REV. 699 (2011).</p><p>(137) See Shaviro, supra note 55, at 137-38. International tax treaties, in mediating double-taxation, also exhibit characteristics of a classical prisoner's dilemma. See also Dagan, supra note 107, at 167-68 (\"The strategic outcome is that developing countries face a prisoner's dilemma: although the treaty regime is costlier for them in tax revenues than the alternative, they join it so as to benefit from the competitive edge it offers or, alternatively, out of fear that their competitors will join and have that advantage.\").</p><p>(138) See Shaviro, supra note 55, at 137 (\"If countries have internal political predilections to cheat too much (leading through contagion to bad long-term outcomes for all), then their treating a cooperative norm as valuable for its own sake might conceivably tend, over the long run, to improve their political decisions from a purely self-interested standpoint.\").</p><p>(139) Herzfeld criticizes EU efforts to tax digital presence and its foreseeable distribution impact on large U.S. technology firms: Herzfeld, supra note 66, at 713 (\"The failure of many high-tax European countries to recognize the benefits their corporate tax systems might receive from reduced profit shifting resulting from U.S. tax reform, and their continued insistence on taxing the digital economy, are more evidence that the supposed concern for fair taxation is largely about something else.\").</p><p>(140) U.S. firms derive eighty percent of market value from intangible assets and own over half of the world's IP. Intangibles also play a significant role in foreign profits. As The Economist reports, \"At the biggest 50 multinationals, 65% of foreign profits come from IP-intensive businesses such as tech and drugs.\" Sec Schumpeter column, supra note 52, at 74.</p><p>(141) See Faulhaber, supra note 22, at 58; see also Schumpeter column, supra note 52, at 74 (\"The latest star firms rely on selling intangibles across borders.\").</p><p>(142) U.S. coercive power over MNEs is analogous although not identical to its outsized influence over the global financial institutions. Cf. Grinberg, supra note 112, at 167 (\"Unilateral coercive pressure of the type exercised by the United States in the FATCA story can succeed when the mechanisms credibly available to the acting state can impose sufficient coercive pressure to change the distributive calculus for other states. In the financial sector, the US market is sufficiently important to global financial institutions' business model, and the damage to the US public from excluding some foreign financial institutions sufficiently manageable, to make the withholding threat used by FATCA.\").</p><p>(143) MNEs are active participants in tax competition and tax avoidance.

The videostreaming firm was once touted as one of the most promising startups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Some even called it the brightest tech star of ChiNext. But alas, Leshi turned out to be a scandal-ridden, financially troubled company.</p><p>What added to ChiNext's embarrassment is the fact that the country's most well-known tech giantsBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD, which are abbreviated as BATJhave all listed their shares on overseas markets.Hundreds of millions of users in China use BATJ's services on a daily basis.</p><p> Yet they have either very limited means or almost no way to buy shares of BATJ. In contrast, the Big Tech Four offer prodigious returns to overseas investors who are not exactly its consumers/users.</p><p>For instance, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose world record-breaking initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $25 billion in September 2014, offered its shares at $68 apiece. The stock started trading at $92.70 straightaway.</p><p>Nearly four years after the IPO, Alibaba's stock price has increased by more than 190 percent.What about investors in China where Alibaba earns most of its revenues and profits? quotMany good companies are developing and the domestic (investors) have not been able to enjoy the fruits and profits of their development.</p><p> This is a historical regret. Entering the new era, this regret should no longer continue,quot said Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body.</p><p>Such regrets have prompted the CSRC to ponder significant regulatory changes. It now aims to not only bolster the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges' status as attractive listing hubs for technology firms but catch the next wave of IPOs by Chinese quotunicornsquot (those with a valuation of $1 billion or more each).</p><p>The securities regulator's move to boost tech representation in the stock markets is in line with the country's transition toward higher-quality economic growth driven by innovation and technological advancement.Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping has pointed out, China is in a critical period of improving its economic structure and upgrading the growth engines of the economy.</p><p>Beijing hopes the capital market will play a bigger role in nurturing the new economy and serve the financing needs of small but promising companies.To realize such hopes, the CSRC has started to fast-track the approval process for tech IPOs.</p><p> The latest evidence was the superfast approval for the planned $4.3 billion IPO by Foxconn Industrial Internet, the local unit of the world's biggest contract manufacturer.Foxconn's clients include Apple and Amazon.</p><p> In a record-breaking 36 days, Foxconn received the CSRC's green signal. Normally, it could take months or even years for companies to obtain the regulatory go-ahead for IPOs.</p><p>In addition to speedy approvals, the regulator is reportedly considering according quotspecial treatmentquot to unicorns. This could mean easing of the profitability requirement for IPOs of unicorns from the four sectors of biotechnology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p><p>The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are also drafting detailed rules and arrangements that will allow overseas-listed Chinese tech companies to return to the home markets.The idea is to make amends for the quotregretquot and enable mainland investors to trade their shares.</p><p>Encouragingly, executives of tech companies including Baidu Inc and NetEase Inc have expressed interest in listing their shares on domestic stock markets as well.Electronics and software company Xiaomi Corp is also said to have planned a float on both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong markets.</p><p>Wang Jianjun, general manager of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, said the bourse has finished the basic preparation for a pilot program that will allow listings of tech unicorns. He hoped the regulator would allow innovative firms that are not yet profitable to float shares in the domestic capital market.</p><p>Analysts said the anticipated domestic floats of overseas-listed tech companies and tech unicorns will require a major revamp of existing rules. Under the current IPO regime, requirements related to continuous profitability and share structure are considered very stringent.</p><p>For example, one listing requirement of the Shenzhen's startup board is that a company must be profitable in the past two years and have profit of at least 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) or have net asset of at least 20 million yuan in the previous quarter. Another example is that the law requires that a shareholding company must follow the quotone share, one votequot principle.</p><p>quotThe existing rules were designed for the old industrial economy with too much emphasis on business scale and profitability. It would be very hard for the new unicorn companies to meet these requirements if the regulator does not make changes to the rules,quot said Dong Dengxin, a finance professor at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology.</p><p>Dong said the IPO reform also faces immense legal hurdles as the country's existing laws ban companies registered in overseas markets and those with dual-class share structure from selling shares in the mainland stock markets.Dual-class share structure refers to the arrangement that grants a particular group of shareholders greater voting rights than others, different from the quotone share, one votequot principle.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that the securities regulator is considering introduction of Chinese Depositary Receipts, a system that will allow overseas-listed companies to transfer part of their shares to a custodian bank, which can sell them on a mainland exchange board.quotWe have studied the option of CDRs for a very long time and have made preparations in terms of trading system and rules.</p><p> At present, the conditions have become relatively mature,quot Wang, the head of the Shenzhen bourse, was quoted by Shanghai Securities News as saying.The priority the mainland regulator and stock exchanges are giving to tech companies also underscores the intensified competition among Asian bourses.</p><p>The Hong Kong stock exchange and the Singapore Exchange are expected to offer soon favorable terms for companies with dual-class share structure, in a bid to get ahead in the regional IPO race.quotThe IPO reform of the mainland market is like an arrow on a bowstring.</p><p> We can expect major breakthroughs,quot Dong said.Equity analysts and market mavens are already wondering about the potential impact of the expected IPO deluge on the A-share market.</p><p>quotOverseas-listed companies will have greater advantage as they are often higher-quality companies. They will get more attention from the investors if they list on the A-share market.</p><p> And because investors have more options, their local listing could exert pressure on the prices of existing A shares,quot said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINFIN-XINFINAGY19032018008806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINFIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX2-TS01-JCH9-G2K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433732</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Xinhua Finance Agency (AP) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua Financial News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000CR7G</classCode><className>LESHI INTERNET INFORMATION &amp;

The code-hosting platform, which was acquired by Microsoft[2] for $7.5 billion in 2018, said that India is home to its third-largest community of developers and has seen 22% growth in the past year, with a 75% increase in public repositories. With its new subsidiary, called GitHub India Private Limited, both GitHub and Microsoft will be better positioned to broaden their appeal to developers across the country. </p><p>But this also fits into a broader trend that has seen all the big tech technology giants, including Facebook[3] and Google[4], go all-in on their quest to target the so-called 'next billion' internet users. On the flip side, however, India has also been introducing sweeping changes in terms of how foreign companies[5] operate in the country, including how they handle and store Indian user data and other 'big tech' regulatory oversight[6]. Ultimately, having a local Indian business makes a great deal of sense for any company looking to capitalize on what could prove a lucrative market. 'As the third-largest group of active developers on GitHub, Indian developers are truly building the future of software,' noted GitHub's chief operating officer Erica Brescia, in a blog post[7]. 'In building out a local team in India, our goal is to create stronger relationships with developers and support open source development across developers, maintainers, and enterprises.' Spearheading the new unit will be general manager Maneesh Sharma, who previously held roles at Adobe and SAP. And in the coming months, they will hire for positions across engineering, community, sales and marketing, and more. It's also worth noting that India is already an attractive hub for many big tech companies to house their overseas engineering offices, due in part to the growing number of developers[8]. Indeed, Uber launched an engineering center in Bengaluru back in 2016[9], and a report from last year[10] indicated that it was preparing to make India its main developer hub outside of San Francisco, with plans to increase its technical staff in the country from around 600 to 1,000 throughout 2020. 'India is also home to one of the largest communities of student developers in the world,' Brescia continued. 'Investing in the future of open source by empowering students is key to our efforts to support the amazing developer ecosystem in India.' As part of its launch, Brescia said that GitHub Education is expanding its grant program to students across the country, promising awards of up to $1,000 for hackathon events. 'We're passionate about supporting the next generation of developers and we're eager to help more student communities come together to learn and build on GitHub,' Brescia added.
